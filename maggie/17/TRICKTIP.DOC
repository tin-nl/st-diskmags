Cartridge Tidbits, Tips, and EasterEggs:€


Alcazar the Forgotten Fortress -

    This game was designed by Activision, but never released by them.
    All known copies were released by Telegames, but with a combined
    Activision/Telegames label.

B.C.'s Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge -

    The following secret codes can be used to change levels: - 17

    Mountain 1:   2,2 in cave 3
                  3,3 in cave 5
                  4,4 in cave 1
                  5,5 in cave 1

    Mountain 2:   2,2 in cave 1
                  2,3 in cave 1
                  4,4 in cave 1
                  4,5 in cave 5

    Mountain 3:   3,1 in cave 5  (hint: "as easy as pi", ie. 3.1415925)
                  4,1 in cave 7
                  5,9 in cave 8
                  2,5 in cave 8

Blockade Runner -

    Need the manual - 01

Bump 'n' Jump -

   Pales in comparison to Intellivision version, with off-key music,
   washed-out colors, sluggish control, unforgiving collision detection,
   and other errors and annoyances. - 20

Cabbage Patch Kids Adventure in the Park -

    Prototype is an enhanced version of the released product, not a
    predecessor. - JH

Carnival -

    Shoot the hardest targets (pipes and letters) first; once you get
    down to a few targets the ducks come out in volume, leaving little
    time or ammunition to shoot the harder stuff. - JC

Chuck Norris Superkicks -

€    Also released as Kung Fu Superkicks, by Telegames. - JC

Cosmic Avenger -

    With some skill, you can make the homing missile that come at you
    strike the UFO's by dodging the missile so it goes in front of you,
    then moving up and down, using it like a guided missile. - JC

   For a completely different gaming experience, trying seeing how long
   you can survive using bombs _only_. - JH

The Dam Busters -

    This game is damn near impossible without the manuals - 01

    Survival tips:

    Don't fly over the icons on the map.  These are German bases that
    will throw up a bunch of flak.
 
  Don't let your engines overheat, turn down the throttle after takeoff. 
 
    If an engine catches fire extinguish it and shut down the 
    corresponding one on the other wing.  If you don't the Lanc. will
    be difficult to control.  Don't do this a second time.
 
   You must come in at a certain altitude and airspeed to drop the bomb.
   Don't forget to get the bomb spinning or the indicators will not
   come up on the pilot's window.
 
    Be certain to retract the landing gear after takeoff.
 
    To shake fighters, try a corkscrew manoeuver (downward spiral). - 17
 
Donkey Kong -

    Move Mario up the first broken ladder then bring him back down, walk
    him to the left so that his back is almost touching the same broken
    ladder, and then move him a step of two to the right and jump.
    Depending on the version you have, he'll fall through the bottom and
    land in screen 2, or after several seconds he'll appear on the top
    girder next to Kong. This apparently doesn't work with all versions
    of the cartridge. - JC

   In the 3rd screen, get to the top right hand part of the screen where
   the purse is. Below is a short ladder, get right above it and wiggle
   up & down, you'll fall through the metal floor. - JC

   When climbing up/down any ladder, stop momentarily; when you continue
   you'll move a super speeds. - JC

Dot to Dot Zot! -

   Originally created for the Nabu Home Computer network, a ColecoVision
€   conversion was rumored but never completed. - 17

Dragon's Lair -

    Right before the crash, Coleco had the rights to Dragon's Lair, and
    was going to release an expansion unit to let you hook up an LD
    player.  The idea was the controller would be the Colecovision, and
    you could play Dragon's Lair in its entirety. - 16

    A version of Dragon's Lair was released for ADAM. - JH

Epyx games -

  Two case variants, one has a normal rounded case end and the other has
  a tapered end much like Imagic carts.  Gateway To Apshai is normally
  the regular case and the other two normally have tapered cases." - 01

Facemaker -

    It's Mr. Potato-Head on a cartridge! - 01

    Also released as Make-A-Face. - JC

Fortune Builder -

    The mother of all Sim* games!  But you need both the manual and the
    "Strategy Guide" to play - 01

    And the overlays certainly don't hurt, either. - JH

Frontline -

    You can get away with using a normal controller by hitting 1-2-3 at
    once on the keypad to launch a grenade/get into the tank - 01

    You can move through the holes in the wall by rotating and pushing
    forward at the same time. - JC

Gateway to Apshai -

    Manual helpful but not necessary - 01

Gorf -

    Loses points for not having the "Galaxian" stage like the arcade
    game - 01

Illusions -

    Very surreal game once you figure out what to do... - 01

    And it makes -no- sense until you do... - JH

Kung Fu Superkicks -
€
    Also released as Chuck Norris Superkicks, by Xonox. - JC

Lady Bug -

    This is (IMHO) the BEST arcade conversion available on the 
    ColecoVision. - 18

Make-A-Face -

    Also released as Facemaker. - JC

    Listed as a pirated version in the Digital Press Price Guide. - JH

Meteoric Shower -

    Not released as a cartridge, the game is only available in the built
    in version that comes with the Telegames Personal Arcade. - JH

Mr. Do! -

   If you drop two adjacent apples and get crushed by the first one, you
   are squished but don't die. You then have to restart the game. - JC

Mouse Trap -

    Since there's no pause feature in this game, you can trap yourself
    in one of the rooms if you need a break.  You can also trap the cats
    in rooms to make it easier for you to do the maze. - JC

Pitfall! -

    You can walk through some walls by jumping at them. - JC

Porky's -

    Bill Zandrew has a copy; no others are known to exist. - JH

Quest for Quintana Roo -

    Manual helpful but not necessary - 01

Root Beer Tapper -

    When at the end of bar grabbing a tip, just tap the joystick and you
    instantly appear back at the front of the bar. - JC

Sammy Lightfoot -

   Plays just like the old Apple II version.  This should _not_ be taken
   as a compliment... B^) - JH

Schtroumpfs -

€    A European release of Smurf Rescue. - JH

Skiing -

    Telegames Skiing does not have the same graphics as the Coleco
    Skiing which was in the introductory catalog.  Whereas Coleco's
    catalog showed a 1st-person perspective, Telegames' Skiing
    is more like Activision Skiing for the Atari 2600. - 08

Smurf Rescue in Gargamel's Castle -

    At the last screen with the skull and Smurfette, leave the room and
    Smurfette will drop her dress. - JC

   If you come up to a hard screen, go back to the screen you just came
   through, and then return - the screen will change shape each time, so
   you can do it until an easier one appears. - JC

    On game 4, move back and forth between screens 1 & 2 for about a
minute, and you'll receive 919,500 points. - JC

Space Fury -

    Save the best dock for last, since you'll be stuck with it for the
    rest of the game. - JC

Spy Hunter -

   At the fork in the road, the left path give's you the oil supply
   truck, and the right gives you the missiles.  You can use the supply
   truck as a weapon by not entering it and moving it back and forth so
   it collides with your enemies.  When in the boat, it's safer to stick
   to the right; you don't get attacked as much and that's the side the
   exit is on. - JC

Star Wars: The Arcade Game -

    Explosion of death star not as impressive as other versions - 01

Super Action Football -

    My copy of the instructions give the part number as 2422 - the
    intended number (per the ColecoVision catalog) for Head to Head
    Football. - JH

Super Cobra -

    "Missing levels" - 01

Sydney Development -

    While Sydney only released one game on their own (Evolution), they
    were a major player in the ColecoVision arena.  Many, many games
    were created or translated for ColecoVision by Sydney.  Among
€    these:

    River Raid
    Keystone Kapers
    B.C.'s Quest for Tires
    B.C.'s Quest for Tires II: Grog's Revenge
    Wiz Math
    The Dam Busters

    The company survived past the video game market crash by switching
    over to the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. - 17

Tarzan -

    If you are low on energy, keep punching the hunter at the campsite
    until you are at full strength. - JC

Time Pilot -

    "Handles like its constipated" - 01

Tunnels & Trolls -

    Only contains opening title. - JC

Venture -

    Move in and out of a room several times very fast, and a demon
    outside will appear from nowhere and kill you. - JC

Video Hustler -

    Nearly finished. - JC

War Games -

    "Need the manual" - 01

    Roller Controller is used for 2 player game only. - JH

War Room -

    "Manual helpful but not necessary" - 01

Wing War -

    Though it is not exactly known what triggers the egg, the designers
    initials appear in the sky. - JC

Wiz Type -

    A Commodore 64 version was finished, but buried by Sierra.  The
    ColecoVision version was never done. - 17

€Zenji -

    Manual is roughly the size of a bookmark, and is completely
    unnecessary. - JH
