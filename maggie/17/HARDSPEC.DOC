ˆColecoVision Specs€

             Resolution: 256 x 192
                    CPU: Z-80A
                   Bits: 8
                  Speed: 3.58 MHz
                    RAM: 16K
Video Display Processor: Texas Instruments TMS9918A/TMS9928A
                                           (Same as TI 99/4A)
                Sprites: 32 multi-color
                 Colors: 16 (4 per sprite)
                  Sound: 4 channel monowith squarewave and white noise.
          Cartridge ROM: 16K/32K

What really distinguished the ColecoVision from other systems of the era
was its 32 sprite capability.  It made it easier to design sprite
intensive games like Slither.

Scrolling on the Coleco was sort of chunky because they did not have
specialhardware for scrolling like the Atari units did - but some games
(notablyJungle Hunt and Defender) _do_ manage to scroll well, so there
was asoftware workaround of some kind.

All Coleco cartridges, and many third party titles, incorporated a
patience-testing twelve second delay before the game select screen
showedup. Before ColecoVision reached the marketplace, Coleco invested
heavily in advertising for the system, building up significant demand.
Theproblem was software support.  Few programmers knew the Coleco
Vision'squirky assembly language, and there wasn't time to train more.
So theengineers at Coleco designed an emulator that allowed progammers
to codein a far more common and well known language, Pascal.  Coleco
then hiredprogrammers familiar with Pascal to design software for the
Colecovision,and thus wereable to provide software to meet the demand.
The onlyproblem with the scheme was the twelve second delay the
emulator causedwhile starting up.  Clearly not every company to put out
cartridges forthe system used thisemulator, though, since cartridges
put out by ParkerBrothers, Activision, Micro Fun, and others do not
exhibit thecharacteristic delay.  - JC, 08, 10

Expansion Module #3 (Super Game Module) by Coleco.

With 30K RAM and 128K "microwafers" shaped like miniature diskettes.The
games were to have intermissions, high-score lists, and extralevels. It
was to be packaged with Super Donkey Kong, and other titles mentioned
were Super Buck Rogers and Super Gorf.  It could have been an excellent
addition to the ColecoVision system allowing you to play your old carts
and the new Super Games, but Coleco decided to turn it into the ADAM
computer. - JC

The Super Game module was supposedly the Coleco optical disk drive.  It
used a magento-optical format called CED.  In an interview with Ralph
Baer, who worked on this system, he said it was really zippy and in some
respects better than CDROM. - 11

C.E.D. stands for Capacitance Electronic Disk system, and was pioneered
by RCA.  RCA used this technology in all of there CED video disk
players,which competed with the Laserdisc format until 1985 when RCA
discontinuedall of its players. Coleco chose the CED format because RCA
could createa computer controllable random access machine that was very
affordable.The Coleco CED system would have come with two major
components: the Coleco"controller" Module (#3) that plugs into the
front of the system, andthe RCA/COLECO CED player that connected to the
Module and the T.V. set.Reportedly the price would be around $395-$495
for a complete set-up.Interestingly, the Coleco CED system would still
play all of RCA'smovie and music video disks, which was a big selling
€point for RCA.So you would have a Video Quality arcade system, and
movie player - allin one.

From Video Games and Computer Entertainment, June 1991:

'Talk of the future reminds Baer of the aborted, ahead-of-its-time 
project he launched in 1982.  The ideal interface, the Colecovision 
video game console and an RCA CED player.  "Things advanced to the 
point that RCA actually made a few CED peripherals.  Then along came the
ADAM computer and ended it all.  What I'd like to see is not going to
happen."  He'd like to see CED revived, instead of the industry going to
CD.  He worries that CD will fail to deliver the full-motion video that
people expect.' - 12

ColecoVision (THE ORIGINAL VERSION) by Coleco.

Remember seeing the first "glimpses" of the ColecoVision system in
Electronic Games magazine?  The first pictures of the system showeda
much more attractive looking system than what we got as a finalproduct.
The system itself had a white faceplate where the ColecoVisionlogo
appears now and the controllers were very different.  They had blueside
buttons, orange pound and star keys on the keypad, and the finger
rollersthat were later introduced on the Super Controllers.

The finger rollers, which were to have been located between the keypad
and joystick, were supposed to be available for use as either speed
controllers, or as a paddle controller.  They were dropped at the last
minute, though if you open up a controller you can see the schematic for
it on the circuit board. - 07

Intellivision Adapter by Coleco.

Coleco had plans for an adapter that would play Intellivision
cartridges.Supposedly there are several working prototypes of this
adapter that wereshown at electronic shows. If Coleco would have only
gone through withproduction, the ColecoVision would have been able to
play Intellivision,2600, and ColecoVision cartridges! - JC

Modem by AT&T/Coleco.

Not to be confused with the ADAM modem, which does exist.

An article in Newsweek, September 19, 1983, on page 69 announced the
following:

'American Telephone and Telegraph Co. and Donkey Kong?  An unlikely
combination, perhaps, but one that became a reality last week when the
venerable communications giant hooked up with Coleco Industries, the
videogame maker, in a join effort to make entertainment software
available by telephone to 25 million owners of video games and home
computers.'

'Under the plan, AT&T and Coleco will develop a "modem", an electronic
device that will connect a home computer or video game by telephone to
€a central data base.  Coleco will supply the software programs, suchas
Donkey Kong or two of its other popular video games, Smurf andZaxxon.
The service will be offered sometime next year for about $20a month;
the modem is expected to cost $100.' - 13

Sensory Grip Controller by Coleco.

The Super Action Controllers were supposed to have a sensory feature,so
that when (for example) Rocky threw a punch in Super Action Boxing,you
would feel it in the handle. - 13

ˆOtherHardwareInfo€

CBS ColecoVision -

Looks and operates just like my 'standard' ColecoVisions, but the
metallic faceplates are different.  On top, it says "1 / 0" instead of
"Off / On", and the front plate reads:

________________________________________________________________________
CBS  Coleco   Video Game/Home Computer System     [expansion slot]   CBS
     Vision                                                      
Electronics
________________________________________________________________________

CBS Electronics bought out the Coleco rights when Coleco bit the bullet.
They marketed mostly in Europe. You can find most if not all of the
€Colecogames with a CBS label. They are all or mostly all PAL games.
However,since the Colecovision doesn't care, it doesn't matter. Plug
them in andthey play like NTSC! - 20, 22


Champ Adapter -

A near exact duplicate of the Coleco Keypad, minus the upper half that
contains the joystick.  Instead it has a 9-pin slot so you can plug
in your favorite joystick and still have use of the keypad.  It also
can double as a joystick extension cable since the Champ Adapter cable
is 6' long. - JC


Co-Stickler -

Plastic "snap" on joysticks for the standard ColecoVision 
controllers. - JH


Expansion Module #1 -
    
The following Atari 2600 cartridges are incompatible with the 2600 
Adapter:

Texas Chainsaw Massacre - JH
All Tigervision titles - 19 (but Miner 2049'er works - JH)
All Supercharger games - 19


Expansion Module #1 Adapter -

This device plugs into Expansion Module #1 (2600 Adapter) to allow
some Atari 2600 cartridges which have compatibility problems to be
played.  Supposedly it was only sent through the mail to those
customers who called Coleco with complaints of 2600 cartridge
problems. - JC


Grabber Balls -

They're red balls of a stick that snap on the ColecoVision controller,
making it more arcade-style.  Work *fantastic* when locked into the
Roller Controller, and played with Robotron on the 7800. - JC


Perma Power Battery Eliminator/AC Adapter -

Replaces the batteries in Expansion Module #2 (Driving Controller) - JC


Roller Controller -

To use the Roller Controller on a game which doesn't require its use
€(such as Centipede or Omega Rage), leave the Joystick/Roller switch
in the Joystick position. - JH
