ˆReview of the Telegames Personal Arcade€           by James Carter

INTRODUCTION:

TELEGAMES produces and sells a ColecoVision compatible system called
the"Personal Arcade". The Personal Arcade was originally produced
severalyears after Coleco stopped production of the ColecoVision. It's
very small(12"x5"x1"), white, and comes with Nintendo-like gamepads. It
uses a normalsized power supply (6' cord) which is less than 1/2 the
size of theColecoVision's ridiculously bulky one. It also comes with a
game/TVswitchbox (10' cord) like the ColecoVision. It also contains two
separateexpansion ports that were never taken advantage of.

COMPATIBILITY:

The ads and box say "Compatible with over 100 ColecoVision cartridges".
TELEGAMES operators claim that it is compatible with 95% of all the
ColecoVision cartridges, but won't provide a list of which ones it
won'twork with.  So far I've come up with 10 after testing it on 65
cartridges.Actually, *all* the cartridges work, it's just that the
"Personal Arcade"uses different joystick wiring and any cartridge made
specifically forthe Super Action Controllers, Driving Module, or the
Roller Controllerwill be unplayable, among others.  In fact, regular
ColecoVision or Ataricompatible joysticks cannot be used on the
Personal Arcade either.

GAMEPADS:

The gamepads are 1 3/4" x 4 3/4" and nicely fit into the sides of the
unit.  The cables are 3 feet long and stiffer than normal.  A personal
grudge is the fact that the cables attach to the side of the gamepad
instead of the rear, making it harder to comfortably grasp.  They are
also slightly too small and cheaply made in my opinion.

KEYPAD:

A single keypad is built into the unit and the buttons are a smaller
3/8"  square, compared to the 5/8" square of the normal ColecoVision
controller. It is made of a thin membrane that works with the slightest
touch. The keypad has no frame like on the ColecoVision controller.
It looks like the following:
      1 2 3 4 5 *
      6 7 8 9 0 #
This changed keypad size and format means overlays cannot be used. It
also means it is very difficult to play keypad intensive games where
quick reflexes are needed.  Now you must take your hand off the gamepad,
and look down to press the right key, instead of the ColecoVision
joystick where you just move your thumb without looking.

NON-COMPATIBLE LIST:

The following are unplayable on the Personal Arcade due to controller
problems:
  Fortune Builder (needs 2 separate keypads in head-to-headmode)
€  Front Line (Super Action Controller game)
  Rocky Super Action Boxing (Super Action Controller game)
  Slither (Roller Controller game)
  Super Action Baseball (Super Action Controller game)
  Super Action Football (Super Action Controller game)
  Super Action Soccer (Super Action Controller game)
  Super Cobra (2nd button "bomb" doesn't work)
  Turbo (Driving Module Game)
  Victory (Roller Controller game)

KEYPAD INTENSIVE LIST:

The following do work perfectly on the Personal Arcade, but are
difficultto play because of the need for very quick keypad presses:
  Aquattack
  Blockade Runner
  Mouse Trap
  Spy Hunter
  War Games

BUILT IN GAME:

The Personal Arcade comes with a built-in game called "Meteoric Shower".
A decent shoot'em up game in which you have a ship in the middle of the
screen and you shoot waves of enemy ships that attack from above and
below.

DISPLAY:
The Personal Arcade removes the famous multi-colored "ColecoVision"
opening screen from all of Coleco's cartridges, replacing it with a
greenbackground and Japanese writing, with the words "1986 BIT
CORPORATION".Other publisher's opening screens are unaffected.

FINAL THOUGHTS

PROS:

The best thing the personal arcade has going for it is the price. Only
$39.95 for a brand new system, with a decent built in game, and you get
to choose 1 brand new cartridge ($19.95 or less, about 40 to choose
from)also.  If you prefer gamepads, then that is a plus also.  The
smallnessof the system makes it much easier to store and move around.

CONS:

If you have a perfectly working ColecoVision there is really no reason
to buy the Personal arcade, unless you want a back-up system.  (...or
youhave a burning desire to play Meteoric Shower. - JH)  The gamepads
areless than desired, and no other joysticks can be used in their
place.The fact that you can't use Super Action or Roller Controller
games(not to mention others) is a big thumbs down for those that
alreadyinvested in those controllers and cartridges.  The keypad on
the systemmay be great for choosing levels, but is a pain to use
keypadintensivegames.

NOTE: Telegames USlost all of their Personal Arcade stock to a tornado
      in April, 1994.
