            =================================================
            NEW PD DISKS JUST IN AND NOT YET COMPILED TO DISK
            =================================================

You can still order these titles but please be aware that there may
not be much else on the disk with them.

Ref: NEW001
DBA Disk Magazine Issue 10.  This high density disk is filled with
lots and lots (hundreds!) of articles, programs, pictures, two superb
modules and a nice graphical user interface.  Very good.  The range
of articles include Jaguar, Falcon, Music, Films and demo reviews and
crew interviews.  A very demo-coders sort of disk-mag but good
anyway.  Falcon enhanced shell.

Ref: NEW002
The Mugwumps amazing Cycedelic Knockout demo.  Comes ZIPped onto
three high density disks, will need about 2.6 meg on hard drive and
full 4 meg of memory.  This is a trance brain blaster.  The music is
8 channel DSP replayed, the graphics are quite amazing.  This is a
sensational demonstration of the Falcon's graphics and sound like
nothing you have ever seen before.  Very 'rave' and trance inspired,
lots of spinning shapes and melting colours.  Very fast, very good
and you MUST get this demo!  RGB but will run on VGA if your monitor
can handle being pushed into 50hz frequency.

Ref: NEW003
DynaPlus is a BRILLIANT version of that age old classic game,
Dynablaster.  How many of you actually knew that the very original of
that whole genere started on the 8-bit Japanese computer called the
MSX with a game entitled Eric and the Floaters by Hudson Soft?  Well
its true!  Run around, bomb away, pick up power-ups, play up to 6
players (minimum 2) and have a riot.  Samples are EXCELLENT, graphics
are EXCELLENT.  In whole highly recommended indeed for some manic
fun.

Ref: NEW004
The Independant Music Compilation 1.  The 1 in the title kind of
suggests there may be more to come, boy I hope so!!!  There are 11
tunes giving you a total of over 52 mins worth of music, the
presentation is top quality, the tunes are top quality (my favourite
is FLY by Beatbox of Aura) and its VGA or RGB compatible.

Ref: NEW005
Tautology is the title of this detailed game of Shanghi on your
Falcon.  Nice enough graphics and sound, lots and lots of options and
you can even design your own tile sets!  Nice one from the Reservoir
Gods.  RGB only, VGA seems to freeze when you select play, I hear
this is to be fixed soon, lets hope so its a great game and very
addictive.

Ref: NEW006
Digital 2.4 is the latest version I have and it is now up to 24
stereo channels of digital sound!!!  This version seems to be easy to
crash but it can play lots of PC modules and is getting better all
the time.  24 channel?  I ask you!  There are three 8 channel PC
modules from the Crystal Dreams demo on the PC included.

Ref: NEW007
I have recently collected together the famous disk magazine - Maggie
from issue 12 onwards it has been Falcon compatible (run in ST LOW(*)
and has had a strong Falcon theme so it seems sensible to give you
the chance of buying these brilliant electronic publications.  I have
issues 12, 13 and 14.  Chris say's (the editor) that issue 15 is due
out soon!  I hope so, its one damn fine magazine.
