Getting Acquainted with the Components

You have purchased the finest video game system on the market today. In
fact, it may be the only true "system" deserving of the name.  But for
allthe sophisticated technology, the Fairchild Video Entertainment
System issurprisingly simple to install, play and maintain.

This booklet will show you just how simple.  We suggest that you read
itcarefully before plugging "this" into "that" or challenging your
next-doorneighbor to a game of video Hockey.  Start by familiarizing
yourself withthe various components that are included with the System.
They are"called out" in the photos below.

Game Console
Hand-Controller Storage Well
€Hand Controllers
Adaptor Box

Connecting the System to the Set

With the Fairchild Adaptor Box in one hand and a trusty screwdriver in
theother, you are a few simple steps from having the System all hooked
up.

First,
disconnect the external antenna from the VHF terminal posts on the back
ofthe TV and attach it to the terminal marked "External Antenna" on
theAdaptor Box.  Connect 300 ohm twin-lead wire coming from the Adaptor
Box tothe now-empty VHF terminal posts.

Note: The Adaptor Box enclosed with your Fairchild Entertainment System
maylook slightly different than the one pictured above.  However, all
of thewiring, connections and labels are exactly the same.  Install as
instructedabove.

Second,
after peeling the protective paper from the back of the Adaptor Box to
exposethe adhesive material, press the Adaptor Box firmly to any clear
area nearthe VHF terminal.

Third, 
plug the Game Cord into the Adaptor Box where indicated.

Fourth,
connect the AC Adaptor to a convenient wall socket.  Note that the
FairchildAC Adaptor has been "safety-designed" to incorporate a captive
screw at thetop of the unit.  To install, just remove the center screw
from the socketwall plate, plug in the AC Adaptor, then tighten the
captive screw into thenow-empty center screw hole.

Some special instructions about 75 ohm cable connections.

Some television sets are equipped to accept a 75 ohm antenna (a round
cablewith a screw-type connector at the end) rather than a 300 ohm flat
twin-leadwire.  Two installations are possible. (1) If your television
has a slider orswitch at the UHF/VHF terminals, move the slider so that
it connects the twoscrews (or move switch to 300 ohm position), remove
the 75 ohm antenna cablefrom the TV and attach it to a "75 ohm-to-300
ohm" balun. (If your set is notequipped with such a balun, they are
readily available from any electronicsspecialty house.)  Lastly,
connect the 300 ohm flat twin-lead wire comingfrom the other end of the
balun to the terminal marked "External Antenna" onthe Adaptor Box. (2)
If your television is equipped with a small length ofcable protruding
from the 75 ohm antenna cable from the set, connect it toa "75
ohm-to-300 ohm" balun and attach to the Adaptor Box as above in (1).
Connect the short length of cable to the now-empty 75 ohm antenna
connectoron the back of the set.

FCC Cautions
€
Because the Fairchild Video Entertainment System is a television
accessorythat could potentially cause interference with neighboring TV
sets, theFederal Communications Commision prohibits:

Hooking up more than one TV set to the System.

Using any more flat twin-0lead wire from the Adaptor Box than is
supplied.

Connecting flat twin-lead wire from the Adaptor Box to any TV antenna or
Cable TV outlet.

Attaching loose wires to your TV antenna while operating the System.

Tuning-In for Game Play

Everything should now be hooked up.  Since the Adaptor Box has a
built-in"TV/Game" switch, you can leave the Adaptor Box conveniently
affixed to theback of the TV set without fear of interference.  That
means that, althoughthe Game Console is a handsome unit designed to fit
nicely into any roomdecor, it can be just as easily disconnected for
storage or reconnected toanother TV set somewhere else.

Special Note: Additional Adaptor Boxes for other TV sets you may have in
your home are available at nominal cost from your Fairchild Video
Entertainment System dealer.  If unavailable, call the toll-free number
listed on the inside back cover of this booklet for ordering
information.

Now, let's get the System ready for Game Play by following these simple
steps:
1. Check to be sure that the Game Console "On/Off" switch (on back of
unit)is in the "On" position.

2. Check to be sure that the AC Adaptor is installed properly.

3. Move the "TV/Game" switch on the Adaptor Box to the "Game" position.

4. Turn the volume on the TV set all the way down.

5. Place the Channel Selector in the Channel 3 position.

6. Push the "Reset" button on the Game Console.

7. When a G? appears on the screen, adjust the TV set so that the G? is
sharp and the background color is pleasing.

Playing Hockey

The Fairchild Video Entertainment System features two "Console" games,
Hockey and Tennis.  In addition, you have access to exclusive
Videocart(TM)*cartridge programming that puts a wide variety of video
games at yourfingertips via optional game cartridges that easily insert
€into the System.

Hockey is a game that is played by (1) programming the Fairchild Video
Entertainment System for the time and motion options you desire (via
thefive Selector Control buttons on the Game Console), then (2) playing
thegame by moving the two players in a variety of ways (via the two
Hand-Controller units).

First, let's program the options.

1. Push the "Reset" button.  A G? will appear on the TV screen, asking
you which game you want to play.

2. Push 1 for Hockey.  A Hockey field will set up on the screen, and the 
question S?, asking whether you want to start playing -- or select a
timeand/or a motion (speed) first.

*A trademark of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation.

3. Push 4 if you want to start immediately.  By doing so, the System is
pre-programmed to select an average motion and no time limit. (Note:
Pushing4 always starts the game in answer to S?)

4. Push 1 to select a time limit.  A T? will appear on the screen,
askingyou how long you want to play.

5. Push one of the Selector Control buttons, 1 through 4 (for example,
button3).  The time selected (in this case, 10 minutes) will appear on
the bottomof the screen.  And again, S?

6. Push 2 to select a game motion.  An M? will appear on the screen,
askinghow fast you want the motion of the puck and the players.

7. Push one of the Selector Control buttons again, 1 through 4 (for
example,button 1), for the slowest through the fastest speed.  Once
more, an S?appears.

8. Push 4 to start play.

The System is pre-programmed so that you can select Time (T?) and
Motion (M?)in either order.  Furthermore, you can choose one or the
other and proceeddirectly to the start of the game.  If you don't
choose a time limit, but doa motion, there will be no time limit.  If
you choose a time, but no motion,the System will choose the average
motion for you.

Special Note: The Selector Control buttons have been engineered for
instantaneous response to a button depression.  Do not hold any of these

buttons down for more than a second.a

How the Hand-Controllers work in Hockey.

The action of the Hand-Controllers differs with the game being played.
€InHockey, all Hand-Controller operations are possible.  These include:

Forward and Backward, moving the player on the screen up and down, from
thetop to the bottom of the screen.

Left and Right, moving the player left and right on the screen.

Rotates Right and Left, rotating the player clockwise and counter-
clockwiseon the screen for angle shots.

Pulls Up and Plunges Down, moving the goalie in the hockey game up and
down,from the top to the bottom of the screen.

Forward and Backward at 45 degree Angles, moving the players up and
down,diagonally.

These motions can be combined to produce a rotating action while the
playeris advancing, retreating, or moving up or down.  You can also
move goalieat the same time you are attacking the opponent's goal.

The object of the game, as you might suspect, is exactly the same as its
namesake sport.  Employing all of the moves allowed by the Hand-
Controllers,the idea is simply to put the puck past the opponent's
goalie and into the"net."

As you practice, working with the Hand-Controllers, be sure to orient
themso that the recessed triangle on the knob is pointing toward the
screen.You will quickly note that the action on the screen responds to 
very slightmovements of the Hand-Controller knobs.  Never violently
twist or wrench theHand-Controllers during play.

Playing Tennis

Learning to play Fairchild's video Tennis game is even easier than
learningvideo Hockey.  Let's take it from the top by programming the
play options:

1. Push the "Reset" button.  A G? will appear on the screen, asking
whichgame you want to play.

2. Push 2 for Tennis.  A Tennis field will appear on the screen, and S?

3. Push 4 if you want to start immediately.  A "ball" will be served
from thecenter of the net to one of the two players.  The speed of the
ball will be"average," automatically pre-programmed into the System.

4. Push 2 if you want to select your own speed.  An M? will appear on
thescreen, asking how fast you want the ball served.

5. Push one of the Selector Control buttons, 1 through 4 (for example,
button4), for slowest through fastest speed.  S? will appear again.

6. Push 4 to start play.

€Although Time (T?) can be programmed into a video Tennis match, the game
ispre-programmed to end when one of the players reaches the score of
15.  Inother words, you could program the match for a specific time (2
minutes, 5minutes, etc.) and if that time expired before someone scored
15 points,the game would end.  However, if 15 is reached before the
programmed timeexpires, the game ends.  For purposes of programming the
options (1 through6 above) we have described play without the T?
option.

How the Hand-Controllers work in Tennis.

The screen players in video Tennis move on a single plane, up and down,
fromthe top to the bottom of the screen.  As in tennis, they are trying
to "return" the ball "past" the opponent.  The Hand-Controllers, then,
areactive only in the Forward/Backward mode, moving the players up and
down,top to bottom.

Other Important features about the Console games.

The "Hold"/Re-program features.

Unique to the Fairchild Video Entertainment System is a "hold" button
thatallows the players to do two things: one, "freese" the action of
eitherConsole game in progress (in order to take a short break) by
simplypushing Selector Control button 3; two, after "freezing" the
action,change either the time, the speed or both during the course of
the game,without altering the score.  For example, if you were playing
Hockey at theslowest speed for a time limit of two minutes, you could
change to thefastest speed and 10 minutes by (a) pushing 3, (b) pushing
1 to select thenew time after S? appears on the screen, (c) pushing 3
for the 10-minutetime limit after the T? appears on the screen, (d)
pushing 2 for motionafter the S? appears and (e) pushing 4 for the
fastest speed after the M?appears.  The game starts again, with the
new options, when you push 4.a

Overtime.  Any video Hockey game can be played into a limited overtime
period, a great idea if the score is tied at the end of the regulation
time.When the S? appears on the screen at the conclusion of the game,
pushing the start button (4) automatically gives you one additional
minute of play.

Videocart(TM) Cartridge Games

The Videocart cartridge feature is an exclusive Fairchild option that
allowsthe owner of our Video Entertainment System to continuously add
to a libraryof Video games.  A number of the Fairchild cartridges,
each containing fromone two four games, are now available.

Inserting and removing the cartridges.  Videocart cartridges are
insertedinto and removed from the Game Console in much the same way as
an 8-trackaudio cartridge is into a cartridge tape player.

Take the cartridge and (as shown below), with the edge label facing
towardsyou, gently insert it until it "locks" into the Game Console.
€To removethe cartridge, first depress the "Press to Eject" bar on the
Game Console,then slide the Videocart cartridge out of the Game
Console, again, verygently.

Complete instructions on each catridge game -- how they are played as
wellas how the various control functions operate relative to each game
-- areincluded with the Videocart packages themselves.

Some cautions in handling and storing the Videocart cartridges.

Never pull the cartridge out of the Game Console without first pressing
the"Press to Eject" bar.  Failure to do so could result in permanent
damage toboth the cartridge and the Game Console.  Also, each
cartridge contains aspring-loaded door at its rear that contains
sensitive electronic circuitry.Do not open this compartment or touch
the componentry inside.  If you do,the cartridge games could be
permanently damaged.

When storing, care should be taken to keep all cartridges from excessive
heatand moisture sources.  Also, since the electronics inside are very
fragile,avoid dropping the cartridges onto hard surfaces.

Troubleshooting the System

Under certain circumstances, you may experience difficulty in getting
theproper screen image or sound from the Fairchild System.  The
followingchecklist will assist you in quickly correcting most problems
likely tooccur.

If there is no playing field or the picture has a "station off the air"
appearance, first push the "Reset" button.  If the problem persists,
check:

* The "On/Off" switch on the back of the Game Console.  Is it in the
"On"position?

* The Adaptor Box.  Is it in the "Game" position?  Is the Game Cord
securelyinserted?  Is the flat twin-lead wire properly hooked up to the
back of theTV set?

* The AC Adaptor.  Is it properly plugged into the wall socket?

* The Channel Selector.  Are you on Channel 3?

* The Videocart Cartridge.  If you are playing one of the optional
Videocartcartridge games, is it properly seated in the Game Console?

If the playfield is unstable, blurred or black-and-white when it should
be incolor, first push the "Reset" button.  If the problem persists,
check:

* The fine-tuning control on your TV set.

* The antenna terminal connections on both the Adaptor Box and the VHF
€terminal posts on back of the TV set.

If you seem to be getting random, unexplainable images on the TV screen, push
the "Reset" button.

If you are on Cable TV or Community Antenna and outside interference
(e.g.picking up another channel) appears on the playfield, formal
broadcasting istaking place on Channel 3 via the Cable or the Community
Antenna source.  In this circumstance, you will have to disconnect the
external antenna fromthe Adaptor Box to play the Fairchild games and
reinstall it to receiveregular television programming.

If the playfield is "tearing" vertically or "rolling" horizontally,
firstpush the "Reset" button.  If the problem persists, adjust the
Vertical andHorizontal controls on your TV set.

If you cannot get normal television programming, check:

* The Adaptor Box.  Is it in the "TV" position?  Is the flat twin-lead
wireproperpy hooked-up to the VHF terminal posts on the back of the
set?  Is theantenna wired securely to the "Connect Antenna" posts?

If the TV set is emitting a buzzing noise, check the volume control. 
When inthe "Game" mode, TV volume should be all the way down.

Special Note: Should problems persist, call the toll-free number listed
onthe opposite page.

Maintaining the System

The Fairchild Video Entertainment System is a precisely engineered
durablyconstructed product that utilizes the most advanced structural
materials andstate-of-the-art electronic componentry.  Properly cared
for, it will provideyears of enjoyment.  Listed below are some
important items to remember whensetting up, playing and storing the
System that will help keep it in top-notch condition.

* Avoid setting food or drink on the Game Console.

* Keep foreign objects, particularly liquids, from falling into the
orificesunderneath the Hand-Controller knobs.

* Turn the Game Console "Off" when not in use.

* Keep the Game Console away from excessive heat sources.

* Do not pick up the Game Console by any of the wires that are
permanentlyattached to it.

* Do not step on the Hand-Controller cords.

* Clean all of the external surfaces, including the dust cover, with a
dampened, soft cloth only.  Do not clean the dust cover with paper
towels.
€
Storing the Hand-Controllers

When not in use, the Hand-Controllers are designed to "nest" in the well
below the dust cover.  To insure that no damage is done to the cord
connections, wrap the cords onto the Hand-Controller bodies in "spool"
fashion.  Hold the Hand-Controller by the ends with both hands and roll
the cord onto the body.

If you are storing your Game Console on top of your TV set, you may
choseto "nest" the Hand-Controllers in their compartment and let the
cords dropbehind the set.  The dust cover has been notched in the back
so that thecords can hang down and the dust cover can fit securely on
the Game Console.
