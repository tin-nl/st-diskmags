1.0)  History of the Intellivision:

- Many of the original Intellivision games were programmed by college
  students as part of their computer programming classes.  Cheap labor?

- Clear up a common misconception.  INTV is NOT an abbreviation for
  Intellivison as many people seem to think.  INTV is the name of the
  company that bought the rights to the system and all it's games from
  Mattel when they decided to leave the market.  Mattel NEVER referred
to it's system as INTV.

- Cheif rival to the Atari 2600.
 
- 16-position control disc was "revolutionary" for it's time but also
one of the reasons Intellivision never did catch up to the 2600.

- Intellivision I consoles had a problem with overheating in the early
  years.

- Major League Baseball was an instant "classic" and one of the most
popular games for the system.
   
- Another "problem" with many Intellivision games was that they were for
  2-players only.

(This section needs some MAJOR help, any contributions here would be
greatly appreciated!)

3.0)  Hardware Listing:

What follows is a brief description of all of the Intellivision
components that are known to exist.

-----
3.1 - Intellivision 
The original, the one the started it all.  It has a brown molded plastic 
case with gold trim on the top.  It has two controller wells on the top 
for housing the two hard-wired controllers.  The controllers are also
brown molded plastic, with a 12-key numeric keypad, two fire buttons
located on each side, and a gold disk centered in the bottom third of
the controller which is used as a joystick:

(crude ASCII illustration goes here =) )

The power and reset switches are located on the lower right hand corner
of the top of the unit.

-----
3.2 - Sears Super Video Arcade 
Up until recently, if you wanted to market your product through Sears, 
it had to have thier name on it.  Much like Atari with the Tele-Games 
Video Arcade, Mattel created a clone that was similar yet different to 
the INTV I.  Functionally identical, this unit has a cream-colored case, 
and removable controllers that rested in the center of the console. 
(more info??)

-----
3.3 - Radio Shack Tandyvision I
Yet another clone, this console has faux woodgrain paneling in the place
of the INTV I's gold panels.  Otherwise, this unit is totally identical 
to the INTV I.

-----
3.4 - Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module
This module attaches to the cartridge port of your Intellivision, and
through the use of special voice-enhanced games, your INTV could talk.
There were 5 games released to take advantage of the unit's capabilities
(Space Spartans, B-17 Bomber, Tron Solar Sailor, Bomb Squad, and
World Seires Major League Baseball (also requires the ECS) ).  The
module has a dial on the front to control the voices' volume.  Voice
games will work without the adapter, but since the voice was made to be
an integral portion of the game, they're toally unplayble.

-----
3.5 - Intellivision II 
In 1982, Mattel decided that they needed to spice up the design of the 
Intellivision, as well as attempt to shave some costs; the Intellivision 
II was the result.  Some key differences include:
        - A much smaller footprint
€        - Grey plastic case with a thin red stripe circling the unit
        - External power supply (not standard by any means)
        - Detachable controllers (although the fire buttons on these 
        controllers are nearly impossible to use, and darn uncomfy =) )
        - Combination Power/Reset switch (probably the most annoying
        feature of all, you have to hold the switch for 5 seconds in
        order to turn the unit off)
        - Power LED Indicator

This unit also contained a revised ROM which was necessary for the ECS
(more on that later), but also made certain Coleco games and some Mattel
gamesincompatible with this unit (Donkey Kong, Mouse Trap, Carnival,
and Chess).

-----
3.6 - INTV III
In 1987, a consortium of ex-Mattel Electronics execs bought the rights
to the since-defunct Intellivision and formed a company called INTV
Corp., and attempted to revive the Intellivision much the same way that
Atari attempted to revive the 2600 around the same time.  This
redesigned unit is physically identical to the original INTV I, except
that it has a black plastic case with silver plates, and also has a
Power LED indicator.
(is the INTV III compatible with the ECS without any modification??)

-----
3.7 - Computer Adaptor
This unit only saw a limited test marketing run of less than one
thousand units.  It was color-keyed to match the INTV I, and the entire
game console fit into the top of the unit. It sported a full-stroke
??-key keyboard, built in cassette recorder, and some other unknown
enhancements.  After muchdebacle, the plans to market this unit were
shelved.

-----
3.8 - Entertainment Computer System
Spurred on by the increasingly popular home computer market, Mattel
introducedthe Entertainment Computer System along with the INTV II in
1982.  This unit plugs into the cartridge port of the INTV II, and has
its own cartridge slot, two additional controller ports, a cassette 
interface, and a balance dial for controlling the output level of the
ECS's three additional voices.  The unit requires an additional power
supply. It came pacakged with a 49-key chiclet-style keyboard, power
supply, and a well-written manual describing INTV BASIC.Upon returning
your registration card, you would receive "The Step-By-Step Guide To
Home Computing", which included a very detailed BASIC Tutorial, and
some more in-depth study of the ECS's abilities.  For the techies, the
unit sported an additional voice chip (total of 6), 10K of ROM and 2K
of RAM for programming purposes.

If you happened to own an original Intellivision, sending in your Master
Component and $19.95 would get you a ROM upgrade that would allow you to
use this unit.

€(Did upgraded INTV I's then have the compatibility problems??)
-----
3.9 - Music Synthesizer
This was an add-on for the ECS, a full 49 key piano style keyboard.  It 
has 6 note polyphony (for you non-musicians, can play 6 notes at once), 
and plugs into the controller ports on the ECS via a dual 9 pin
connector.  Melody Blaster was the only program released by Mattel to
specifically take advantage of this component.

-----
3.10 - System Changer
The Atari 2600 had the biggest library of games at the time, and Mattel 
added the capability of playing 2600 carts to the INTV II with this
module.This unit also interfaces with the INTV II via the cartridge
port.  It has a cartridge port on the top of the module, Game Select
and Reset keys flanking the two difficuly and color/BW switch:

(yet another crude ASCII drawing goes here =) )

The controller ports are located on the front of the module, and any of
yourfavorite 2600 compatible controllers work just fine.  If you don't
happen to have Atari controllers lying around, you can use the disc
controller attached to the INTV II in lieu of them.  The author has not
currently found any gamesthat will not operate with this adaptor, if
anyone knows of any, please speak up =)

Here again, if you wished to use this module with your original
Intellivision, you had to send the unit in for the ROM upgrade.  It's
interesting to note that on an unmodified Master Component, when turned
onwith this unit plugged in, the title screen reads "M-Network", and
you canhear all the sounds from the 2600 game you have inserted, but no
video.

4.0)  Cartridge Listing:

This list contains information from VGR'S Giant List of Intellivision
games, Sean Kelly's list, and Paul Thurrott's List, as well as some 
information I have from personal experience.

Manufacturer's Key:
MA = Mattel     IM = Imagic     PB = Parker Bros.       IN = INTV
SE = Sega       AT = Atarisoft  AC = Activision         CO = Coleco
IT = Interphase

Ovr? Key:
Yes = Has overlays      No = No Overlays        ?? = Don't Know =)

Notes:
Any interesting tidbits, such as additional hardware required, 
release notes, and compatibility.  Please note that the compatibility
issue varies from person to person, e.g. two people have told me that
Chess works in their INTV II's, but it freezes in mine.

get a 'ticker-tape' deisgned (sic) by message.  (Not verified by the
author)

-----
4.2 - Information regarding Label Variations

This information was provided by Jerry Greiner (jerryg@hevanet.com), and
is by no means considered gospel, but until someone else comes up with
something better, this works pretty well =)

There are 4 main "distributors" of the Intellivision games though we
tendto call them manufacturers. For instance, Atarisoft manufactured
the INTVversions of the Atari titles as well as the Atarisoft release
versions.

The 4 "distributors" are:

        - Mattel, the original "manufacturer" of the Intellivision.
        
        - INTV, the company that was formed and bought out the Mattel 
        rights to Intellivision products.
        
        - Sears/Telegames which distributed Intellivision games and 
        systems under their own names.
        
        - Telegames, which is still in business and which owns many of 
        the rights (if not all) to the Intellivision games. Their games 
        are most likely manufactured by CBS Electronics in Italy, though 
        not all are.

The games originally manufactured to be distributed by Matell have a (c)
MI or (c) MEI on the label. These are the only types of labels known to
have been sold by Mattel.

Sealed INTV boxes (yes INTV boxes were different, though, like the
cartridges, they also used the leftover Mattel boxes) have been found
(frequently) with 3 types of labeled games in them:
   
        1. (c) II, white label
        2. (c) MI
        3. (c) MEI
        4. no copyright or country of origin, colored label
        5. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label
        6. no copyright or country of origin, white label

The (c) II is the closest thing to being a "regular" INTV release, but
notcomplete proof.

Sears/Telegames released games in specially designed boxes which are
quiteeasy to identify. They are a dark redish brown and clearly say
"Sears/Telegames". The labels on the games sold by Sears/Telegames are
of several types:
€
        1. no copyright or country of origin, colored label
        2. no copyright but with a country of origin, colored label
        3. (c) MI
        4. (c) MEI

Telegame releases are in a variety of boxes, most commonly in a box
clearly identified as "Telegames". They can still be purchased from
Telegames, UK. There are a variety of labels on these games, but the
most common, and the closest to "official" Telegame releases are a
white label with no copyrightor country of origin on them. The
following labels have been found in Telegames boxes.

        1. no copyright or country of origin, white label
        2. All of the above varieties.

There may be a way of telling the White Label, no (c), no country of
origin INTV games from the White Label Telegames in some cases as there
tends to be two distinct styles and sizes of lettering used.

The bottom line is:

You can't tell who sold or manufactured the games themselves in most
casesexcept:

        - If it is (c) MI or (c) MEI it was manufactured for Mattel
        - If it is (c) II it was manufactured for INTV

The boxes were manufactured for the company (one of the 4 above) and can
be identified as they are clearly marked. They were not necessarily sold
by the same companies.

5.0)  Trivia and vaporware:

-----
5.1 - PlayCable
The idea of beaming Junior videogames through Cable TV is not new; a
companycalled PlayCable created an adapter for the Intellivision that
plugged intothe cartridge port, and the service would have had a
selection of 20 of themost poular games available every month. Although
this product was talkedabout quite a bit for well over a year, the idea
flopped, and the device wasnever released.

-----
5.2 - Intellivision III
Atari wasn't the only company with plans to introduce a "nextGeneration"
video game system;  Mattel spoke of it's soon-to-be released
IntellivisionIII for well over a year before the idea was dumped.  Here
are some of thespecifications for this unit:

  - Built-in Intellivoice
  - 320 x 190 resolution
€  - Unlimited colors
  - Onscreen sprites move at 2x the speed of the original Intellivision
  - Six channel sound with RCA outputs
  - Remote controlled joysticks
  - Four controller ports
  - Plays original Intellivision titles as well as Aquarius titles
  - 12k ROM - 10k RAM
  - Able to manipulate 64 sprites onscreen at once
  - 6-8 titles announced including Air Ace - a flight simulator
  - Scrapped for fears of not being able to introduce it before Coleco
Visionand the Atari 5200 had too strong a grip on the "next
generation" market.
  - Projected price : $300

Please note that this unit is COMPLETELY different from the INTV III
whichwas later released by INTV Corp in 1986.

7.0)  Repair tips and information:

Most of the information provided here has been taken from the book

DriveYou Insane", by Gordon Jennings, or has come from personal
experience.Excerpts taken from the book are enclosed in quotes.

7.1 - Hand Controllers

Let's face it, I don't know a single person would could say that they
preferthe Intellivision hand controllers over a standard joystick with
a straightface, but you're stuck with them if you own an INTV I or III,
as they arehard-wired into the unit.  There WILL come a time when they
will fail. Fortunately, there are some simple steps short of totally
disaasemblingthe main console you can take to fix controllers.

"Inside the controller is a plastic sheet with a circuit painted (or
silk-screened) on it.  This is call the Membrane Printed Circuit Board,
or MPCBfor short.  Often, pieces of the circuit chip off and cause the
controllerto short out.  This can be repaired by opening the controller
and cleaningout the MPCB with a soft cloth"

"To gain access to the MPCB, loosen and remove the four small screws on
theback of the controller.  With the controller facing up, lift off the
topcover.  Remove the round control button and the spring beneath it.
Thereshould also be a white plastic spacer, sandwiched between two
sections of the MPCB directly beneath the spring (Note its position.
It must be placed back between these two sections when you put the
€controller back together)."

"Slide out the black side buttons (When reassembling the controller,
theseare useful in holding down the MPCB, which tends to pop out).
Remove thegold numeric pad and the clear sheet (static shield) beneath
it."

"Remove the MPCB.  Visually inspect it to see if it's still in good
condition.  Hold it up to the light; if you see any holes or breaks in
it,it should be replaced."

To reassemble the hand controller, follow the above instructions in
reverseorder.  "Note that the MPCB, static shield, and numeric pad have
two smallholes in each of them.  These holes interlock with the two
pins protrudingfrom the bottom cover of the hand controller, making it
easier to align andadjust the MPCB into its proper position."

If your MPCB's require replacement, a great source of spare parts are
thosetotally trashed, $2 INTV consoles you pass up at the flea market.
Not onlyare the hand controllers usually in working order, but you get
a whole slewof other spare parts, such as logic boards, transformer
assemblies, powersupplies and switches.

(If anyone knows of a source for new spare parts, please let me know so
I can include the information in the FAQ.)

7.2 - Cartridge Problems

Help!!  I've turned on my console and all I get is a black screen!!
What doI do??

First off, follow the teachings of one of my favorite sci-fi authors, 
Douglas Adams: "Don't Panic!"

Secondly, ensure that the cartridge is properly inserted.  Not inserting
thecartridge far enough, or even inserting the cartridge too far can
cause theconsole not the read the game.  

Dirty contacts on the cartridge itself may also cause a problem; use a 
cotton swab and some denatured alcohol to remove any corrosion from the 
gold contacts (the swabs used for cleaning VCR heads work best, as they
arelint-free).  I STRONGLY recommend against using a pencil eraser, as
is so popular in many PC repair circles.  Not only does the rubber build
up a static charge in the cart, potentially damaging the ROM's, it also
removes some of the gold plating on the PC board.  Too many treatments
of this manner could result in a useless game.

If you know the problem is not with the cart, all is not lost. If you're 
handy with a volt-ohm meter, you can usually pinpoint the problem to one 
of the major components inside the console.

-----
7.3 - Console Disassembly
€
For those of you who have seen the inside of an Intellivision before,
skip to the next section.  What follows is a basic description of all of 
the Intellivision's major components.

The system is comprised of four major components.  "First is the transformer
assembly.  The assembly itself is made up of smaller component; the AC
Power Cord, the ON/OFF switch, and a small plastic connector."

"The next major component is the power supply board.  It receives AC
powerfrom the transformer assembly, and transforms it into several
differentDC values.  Not only does it convert the voltages, but it also
stabilizesthem for the logic board."

The third set of components are the hand controllers.

"The final unit is called the logic board.  This board is the brains of
the Intellivision."

Okay, so with phillips screwdriver in hand, you're ready to rip apart
your Intellivision.  First off, as with any electronic repair work, be
sure that your work area is free of static electricty.  I personally
use a wrist grounding strap clipped to some metal portion of your work
area.

"Unplug the unit from the wall and from the television.  Remove any 
cartridge from the machine.  Turn the power switch to the ON position to 
drain any stored up voltage.  Place a soft cloth on your work area.
Turnthe console upside down and place it on the cloth.  Using a
phillips screwdriver (some units may require a nutdriver), remove the
six coverretaining screws."

"Turn the unit back over and gently lift off the top cover.  The small
brown cover for the ON/OFF switch will come off at this point.  Weave
the hand controllers through the holes in the top cover."

"The insides of the Intellivision are now exposed.  You should be able
toidentify he four major component groups.  There is a brown plastic
platecovering and securing the logic board, transformer and power
supply board.Remove the six screws holding down the plate, and place
them aside."

Be CERTAIN to see how the controllers are placed in this plastic plate,
as they must be replaced in the exact same fashion in order for the top
cover to fit securely.

-----
7.4 - General Troubleshooting

Some of the procedures listed here will require the use of a volt-ohm
meter.  All of this material has been taken from the aforementioned
reference.

Problem:  When you turn the game on the screen clears, title comes on,
€but game will not play when hand controllers are pushed.

Repair:  This normally indicates that on or both of the MPCBs must be
cleaned or replaced.  Sometime you can open up the hand controller,
clean it off, put it back together and it will work. (see 7.1 for info.)
If you have cleaned or replaced both MPCBs and the problem still exists,
then you may need a couple of new hand controller cables or a new logic
board.

Problem:  When you turn the game on, the screen clears (turns dark), but
game title does not appear on the screen.

Repair:  With the power switch in the OFF position, take the cover off
the unit.  Unplug the transformer assembly from the power supply board.  
Place the power switch in the ON position.  Using your VOM, test the 
following voltages:

        - The first readings you'll need to take are on the plastic
        connector of the transformer assembly.  They are AC voltage
        readings.  If the voltages do not read as follows, then replace
        the transformer assembly, it cannot be repaired.
                                                ________
                        Yellow Lead -->   ------| |     |
                          Blue Lead -->   ------| |     |
                  Green/Yellow Lead -->   ------| |     |
                         Green Lead -->   ------| |     |
                         Green Lead -->   ------|_|_____|

                        Yellow Lead to Blue Lead - 18 VAC
                Green/Yellow lead to any Green - 9.25 VAC
                      Green Lead to Green Lead - 18.5 VAC

        - Turn the unit off.  Reconnect the transformer assembly to the 
        power supply board.

   - Turn the unit ON.  The next set of voltages are DC voltages and
   should be read from the other end of the power supply board.  They
   can be taken right off the cables leading to the logic board.  
   There are two sets of leads; a small two prong lead near the top of 
   the board, and a flat five prong lead near the bottom right corner. 
   Place the black clip of your volt-ohm meter on the lead from the two 
   prong clip farthest from you (if looking down, the is the lead 
   closest to the upper right hand corner).  Place the other lead of 
   your meter into the holes for the 5 prong lead each in turn, and 
   note the voltages.  They should read as follows:
        
                                        _______
                        +  5 VDC -->    | |_| |
                        + 12 VDC -->    | |_| |
                        + 16 VDC -->    | |_| |
                        +  0 VDC -->    | |_| |
                        -  2 VDC -->    |_|_|_|

If any of the voltages are not present, the power supply board should be 
€replaced.  If you want to attempt to repair the board, most of the
problems are associated with the two voltage regulators, one being a
7805 and theother being a 7812, or the two larger capacitors.

8.0)  Programmer Interviews:

The two following interviews were condicted over Internet with a couple
of ex-Mattel Electronics employees by Sean Kelly (skelly@bbs.xnet.com).

*************
Daniel Bass *
*************

>What was your line of work before you became an Intellivision
programmer?

I joined TRW right out of grad school, I was working there as a software
engineer.  I had started in Feb. 1981, just as the Reagan Administration
came into office.  The job I was supposed to work on was frozen, and
therewas an enormous delay in getting any kind of security clearance,
so thatlimited what projects were available to me.  As a result, I
spent my firstyear there not accomplishing very much on a variety of
small projects.

>How/Why did you come to work at Mattel?

In the spring of 1982, I heard on the radio of an Open House / Job Fair
at Mattel Electronics, and I thought it would be a fun way to spend the
afternoon - playing with their latest games and gadgets.  I was not very
happy about my job at TRW, but I wasn't looking to go anywhere.  When I
gotthere, I started talking to one of the managers about Dungeons &
Dragons, a personal passion of mine.  He was looking for some people to
develop a D & D style game for the Intellevision Keyboard, the big
keyboard.  One thing led to another, and in a few weeks I was on board
at Mattel Electronics.

>Exactly which games did you personally program?

Loco-Motion was the only game I programmed start to finish.  I also 
programmed Tower of Doom but I only had the game about 80% done when 
Mattel Electronics went out of business.  I had concentrated on the 
special effects and mechanics, but I hadn't put in the game play and 
strategy that I had had in mind.  A few years later, one of the guys 
was contracting out with whoever it was that had bought up all the 
Intellevision property (was that INTV?) to finish a bunch of the games 
that were in development when M.E. went under.  Tower of Doom was one 
of those games.  I had since moved from California to Massachusetts, 
and so had not the equipment, nor time to do the completion.  He got 
one of the other programmers to finish it up, but he didn't add any
gameplay either, he just tidied up the loose ends so that the game had 
an ending and wouldn't crash.
€
>Were you involved in programming any other games?

Most games were developed by a single Game Designer, with the help of 
certain "specialists."  There were a few graphic artists who designed 
most of the graphics for most of the games, a few sound people who 
developed most of the sound effects.  However, the total game
developmentand integration was done by a single engineer.  

There was a lot of testing, feedback, and reviews amongst the game 
designers.  A significant portion of our work week was assigned to
playing other people's games to find bugs, cite improvements and offer
suggestions.To this end I worked on several games, but that wouldn't
qualify as programming.

I also worked on several projects that just didn't go anywhere, and were
dropped.  The whole big keyboard project (for which I had been hired)
wasdropped not long after I started working there.  It was deemed to be
toexpensive to produce, so that it would be unsaleable.  Subsequently
it wasredesigned, and code-named "LUCKI" [pronounced 'lucky'] for Low
User-CostKeyboard Interface.  I started developing a Stock Market game
for the LUCKI, when, one day, the arcade version of Loco-Motion turned
up next tomy cubicle.  I watched and played several games, and I was
hooked. Literally overnight I had developed an Intellivision prototype
of thearcade game, and the rest, as they say, is history.

>What was it like working for Mattel?

It was an absolute blast!  The people there were all a bunch of
overgrownkids, and management encouraged us to work on having fun as
hard as getting product out.  The result was an atmosphere of great
teamwork andcameraderie.  Some examples:

    The annual office party would be held by renting out a local video
    arcade and providing Pizza / Deli / Beer / Sodas and unlimited 
    video games to all the staff and their families.

    The arrival of a new piece of equipment would often lead to the
    impromptu creation of a new game, using the packing materials 
    in the hall.  Several of the managers in particular were
    particulary creative in constructing these games.

    Numerous arcade machines lined the walls of the work areas, and
    people were encouraged to take breaks to study the games and 
    improve our hand-eye coordination.
    
    All of Mattel Electronics and families were invited to Disney 
    Studios for a private pre-release screening of "Tron" .

>Can you fill us in on any 'unfinished' projects that may have been
>in the works when Mattel Electronics went out of business?

I'm afraid that I can't be much help here.  So I'll answer a different
question.
€
Things started turning down for the entire video game market around
the beginning of 1983.  I finished Loco-Motion, and in the summer,
started working on Tower of Doom.  It was originally supposed to be
a voice-optional game, and by the fall I was putting in many long
hours focussed on getting that going.  Around October, Mattel had
its first round of layoffs.  About 1/3 of the staff was gone over-
night.  The atmosphere had become quite depressed, and I coped by
becoming ever more involved with working on Tower of Doom, and
blocking out what was going on around me.

In November we had the second round of layoffs, and another third
of the staff was gone.  It seemed like there was no hope left for
the few of us that remained, but I kept plugging away at T-O-D,
hoping that I'd have enough time to finish the game.  Unfortunately,
in January 1984, Mattel Electronics went out of business, and that
was that. 

So, about all I remember from that time period was how depressing
things got, and how desparate I was getting, hoping that I'd be
able to finish T-O-D.

>As game collectors, one of the biggest problems we have is finding out
>exactly what games are out there to be had.  Do you know of any games
>that may be in existence that are not listed on the 'complete' listing
>I sent you?   

I doubt I can help you here.  While I enjoyed playing the games, I was 
never a 'walking encyclopedia' on them.

>Do you still own an Intellivision system?

Yes, although I never use it.  Now my son Aaron (9 years old) uses it.

>What was/is your personal favorite Intellivision game? 
                                                       
Now you're going to have me make enemies of all people whose games I
don't mention! :-)

Well, leaving aside a personal bias for Loco-Motion and Tower of Doom,
I really like Thunder Castle for its graphics and music.  It is such a
pleasure to look at and listen to, that you can forgive it its simple
game play.

There was a Pinball game I liked, but I was always more into pinball
machines than Arcade Video games.

Buzz Bombers and Thin Ice were both cute.

My favorite game when I was on mental overload was Shark! Shark!  I
found that the colors, sound, and pace of the game was generally rest-
ful and relaxing, unlike most video games which leave you all keyed up
and strung out.

> What was your line of work before you became an Intellivision 
programmer?
 
I came to Mattel straight out of school.  I was a EE major.  Initally,
I hired on at Mattel to do handheld games, such as electronic football,
basketball, etc.  then moved into the Intellivision group after a couple
of years.

> How/Why did you come to work at Mattel?
 
After graduating from UCLA in 1978, I did a lot of interviewing. Most of 
the local companies in Southern California were defense oriented and I
wasn't particularly interested in going down that path at that time.
I also talked to a number of chip companies in Silicon Valley.  By far,
the most interesting job was the one at Mattel.  I had my doubts about
Mattel's longterm stability, since they had recently completed some
litigation about how they were running the business and also since the
toy industry in general tends to follow boom and bust cycles.  However,
in the final analysis, it came down to that sure sounds like it would
be a lot of fun.
 
> Exactly which games did you personally program?
> Were you involved in programming any other games?
 
In Intellivision, my games for Mattel were BurgerTime and I also did
about half the programming on Masters of the Universe.   After Mattel
got out of the business, I worked on Diner (a BurgetTime sequel) and 
Super Pro Hockey for InTV, who took over the Intellivision business 
from Mattel.   I also worked on the concept development for
Super Pro Football, though I didn't do any of the programming.
 
In handheld games, I wrote Computer Gin and World Championship Football.
In addition, I also worked with a championship chess player on Computer 
Chess.

> What was it like working for Mattel?
 
It was a blast!  The best part by far was the team that we had put
together.   There was lots of diversity the talents and interests
of members of the group and that added a lot to the quality of the
games.   In fact, every year there is the annual layoff reunion
party, where everyone gets together to reminisce and network and
all those sorts of good things.  Next year is the 10th anniversary,
so there may be some special festivities planned.
  
> Can you fill us in on any 'unfinished' projects that may have been
> in the works when Mattel Electronics went out of business?
 
When things went under at Mattel, I was working on a sequel to Masters
€of the Universe with a lot of Escher-looking screens.  After a few
mutations and change in characters and story line, I was able to finish 
that game as Diner, a sequel to BurgerTime done by InTV.  When InTV 
bought out the rights to Intellivision, they bought the right to all the
work in progress at the time.  Much of the work that was fairly far
along was later published by InTV, so you can see what was happening
at that point.  After a while, we ran out of pre-existing work, and
so we ended up doing some new work and other sequels to existing games,
especially the sports titles.
  
> Do you still own an Intellivision system?
 
Of course!  Since the machines tended to breakdown every so often
and since I suspected that it would become increasingly difficult
to get them fixed, I made sure to store away 3 or 4 Intellivisions
in the attic to make sure that my kids would be able to see what
I had done at Mattel.  So far, I have only lost one machine, so they
were a lot more reliable than I thought they would be.

> What was/is your personal favorite Intellivision game?
 
Of the work that I did, I would probably rank Diner as my favorite,
followed closely by BurgerTime.  I would also rank Night Stalker
pretty highly.  I also played a lot of Sea Battle and would count
that among my favorites. 
 
> What is your line of work now?
 
After Mattel went under, since there was so little commercial work
around the area and no video games work anywhere at the time, I went 
to TRW to work on defense systems.  Fortunately, I was able to get 
involved with some pretty fun projects using early versions of Sun 
Workstations and so I was able to have some fun, learning lots about 
GUI and all those things that are still increasing in popularity.
I even designed a paint program for a government project, probably one 
of the only paint programs ever done specifically for the government.   
 
Since then, I've moved over to the PC business and am doing Windows
work for first for Software Publishing Corporation on Harvard Graphics
for Windows. I also worked on their InfoAlliance project, which was one 
of the first GUI database projects available. Unfortunately, though the 
market was ready for such a product,SPC was not and the product died an 
unfortunate death.Currently, I am at Borland working on future versions
of Paradox for Windows.
 
>Lastly,Dan said I had to ask you about your"Cheesburger Birthday Cake".
>What gives???  8-)
 
Dan's wife was taking a cake decorating class and one day they surprized me 
and brought in a birthday cake shaped like a giant hamburger.  Obviously the 
connection was BurgerTime.
