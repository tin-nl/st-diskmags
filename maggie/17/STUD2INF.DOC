ˆWhat is the RCA Studio II?€

ˆRCA Studio II€

The RCA Studio II is a game machine that was released in 1976, shortly
afterthe boom of Pong clones and machines, only a few months after the
FairchildChannel F.  It had the same shortcomings as the Channel F,
namely being thetechnology was growing at such a rapid rate at the time
that these machineswere almost immediately made obsolete by the Atari
2600, Intellivision, andsystems that followed thereafter.

It is a direct decendant of Pong games, and you can tell by its styling.
Itisn't made very well--it's small, which is unique for the time, and
coloredyellow.  It doesn't have hand-held controllers.  Instead, its
controllers areon the unit itself, like Pong games.  The difference is
that while Pong gameshad paddles, the RCA Studio II had numeric
keypads.There were arrows moldedinto the plastic case for easy use of
the keypadsas controllers.

Like Pong games and the Fairchild Channel F, its sound is limited to a
smallspeaker inside the unit.  The only sound this speaker can make is
abeep.It was interesting the way they used this beep--for example, in
theracinggame that was included with the unit, when you crash, it has
agrindingbeep noise.  Rather irritating, but apparently pretty good
forits time.

Collecting the RCA Studio II can be challenging, because it's one of the
morerare systems.  To make it even more difficult, the way you hook it
up to yourTV is similar to the Atari 5200: plug the power supply and
gameinto theswitchbox.  The Studio II doesn't have a power switch--the
switchbox turnsthe power on when it's switched to "game".

One last unique item about the system is the cartridges seem "backwards"
fromwhat we are normally used to.  Let's take the Atari 2600 as an
example.  Thecartridge plugs into the game, and has two plastic tabs
that insert intothe console.  The Studio II is reverse of that--the
CARTRIDGE has holes, whilethe CONSOLE has two rods that insert into the
cartridge!

All in all, it's a decent system to collect for.  While its graphics are
notclose to the quality of some of the other games of the time, it's a
neatsystem to rub in the faces of your friends when they try to impress
youwith their 3DO's. :)
