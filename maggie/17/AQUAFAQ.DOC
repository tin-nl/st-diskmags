€               ˆMattel Aquarius FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)€
                „About the Mattel Aquarius Home Computer System€

     Well in 1982 Mattel decided to enter the already crowded home
computer market with the Aquarius.  The Aquarius was intended to be
a home computer and gaming system.  Mattel around the same time came
out with a computer keyboard attachment for their successful home
entertainment system the Intellivision.  (I know very little of this
keyboard attachment system).

    The Aquarius features are the following:

Processor:             Z80A

                       higher)

                 (similar to Intellivision controllers but with 6 keys
                instead of 12 and no side fire buttons).  The unit added
                 2 additional sound channels.  Had two cartridge slots
                 one for a memory cartridge and the other for a program
                 cartridge.

Hardware Options:   Master Expansion Module - was a large expansion box
                    that had two floppy disk drives.  It would allow you
                    to use floppies on the Aquarius and allow you to
                    boot CP/M.

Software:        Extended Microsoft Basic - would give you most if not
                 all the remaining commands of MBasic.  With this you
                 were also able to access the Mini Expanders controllers
                 to write games to use them.

--              Is the Aquarius Public Domain?          --
----------------------------------------------------------

     Is the Aquarius equipment/software Public Domain like the Vectrex
system?  This I don't know yet.  In 1984 Mattel was reported to have
sold the marketing rights to Radofin Electronics the producer of the
system. I am in the process of trying to find out the status of the
Aquarius. If it is most software was on cartridges which means that
they would have to be burned into Eproms to use the them. Unless someone
was able to write a copy program and transfer cartridges to tape/disk
and be run from that medium like the ADAM.
