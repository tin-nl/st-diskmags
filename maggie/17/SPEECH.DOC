ŒFrom the 1982 Intellivision catalog:

ˆVoice Synthesis Module
€
Now Intellivision talks to you. Intellivoice is an all-new Intellivision
feature--a voice synthesis module.  It generates human-sounding voices
whichbecome an essential part of the game play.  You concentrate on the
visualaction while your IntelliVoice component keeps you aware of
depleting energylevels, shield damages, and attacking fighters.

Voices that sound human. IntelliVoice produces voices with personality.
All instructions, directions and announcements are crisp and clear.  
IntelliVoice is your computer voice partner in game play.

Not just effects. Voices generated by Intellivoice give you important
game playing data.  The IntelliVoice comes in throughout the game,
keeping youinformed at all times.

Added realism. The IntelliVoice feature adds important new dimensions in
realism.  For example, IntelliVoice seems to put headphones on you as
youcommand a B-17 Bomber over enemy territory, contending with attack
fighters,navigation requests, and tower instructions.

Easy add-on installation. The IntelliVoice unit simply plugs into the
cartridge outlet on your IntelliVision Master Component.  IntelliVoice
cartridges simply plug into the IntelliVoice unit.

Special IntelliVoice cartridges are required to operate the module and
addhuman voice to game play. (Regular IntelliVision cartridges may also
be plugged directly into the IntelliVoice and will give you game play
withoutvoice, as if they were plugged directly into the Master
Component.)  Look forthese specially marked game cartridges with the
IntelliVoice feature whereverIntellivision is sold.

EACH SOLD SEPARATELY AND AVAILABLE SOON.
