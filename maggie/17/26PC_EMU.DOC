ˆNews on Activision's 2600 emulator€

Ok, here's the info I got from the flier Activision was giving out at
WCES, as well, info from one of the reps at the booth.

The person I talked with there said that they had no presskit on the
package as of yet.  He said that you would need atleast a 486 33 (I'm
goingto guess he ment DX but he didn't clarify) to run the software at
correct speeds.  This package will only run under Windows and they have
no plans to release a DOS version.  The games are running in a real time
2600 emulator under windows in original code.  There are no plans to
release anything that will allow you to upload your cartridges from home
into the emulator.  Moreof these packs will be release in the future
based on the success of thisone.  From what I saw, the games played
through the joystick controllerport, so you can use either a joystick
or control pad.

The release will be on both 3.5" disk and CD-ROM, and should be out this
month I think.

While at the booth, I did play river raid, and while it look accurate,
I'venever played the 2600 version, on the 5200 version.  The other
games Iwatched all looked fine as well, but I haven't seen most of these
gameson a 2600 for so long now that I don't remember exactly how the
originalslooked.  With the exception of Pitfall, which looked to be
right on themoney.  Anyways, if they are all original code, then they
should all be100% accurate.
