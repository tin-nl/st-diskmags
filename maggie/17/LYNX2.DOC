                           THE LYNX COLUMN
                           ----------------

 by LEON O'REILLY
and NICE GUY EDDIE/RESERVOIR GODS

        The Lynx scene has been a  bit  quiet  since the last issue of
Maggie, with all Atari's  efforts  being  concentrated  on the Jaguar.
Still, it gives us a chance to  delve into the Lynx back catalogue and
review some classic carts. These  carts  can  usually be found at very
reasonable prices, but are they worth owning?

CHIP'S CHALLENGE
================

        Chip's is one of the first and  most well known lynx games, as
it has appeared in  various  home  computer  incarnations. Most people
don't realise  that  it  was  a  lynx  long  before  it  reached other
platforms. It was actually coded by Epyx, the designers of the Lynx.
        Chip's is a puzzle game with arcade element. You view the game
from an overhead perspective a la  gauntlet.  The object of each level
is to collect an allotted amount  of  chips, then find the exit. Sound
easy? Well not quite... Impeding  you  are  all sorts of creatures and
fiendish mazes and of course a time limit!
        Each obstacle can be logically  overcome. For example, you can
pick up a water shield to  move  over  water  or a fire shield to move
over fire. Bridges can be created  over  water,  keys can be found for
doors.
        Chip's cleverly builds on  these  very simple elements through
144 well designed mazes. The first couple  of levels are a doddle, but
soon you are having to scratch your head  to get to the exit. There is
a level skip facility should you get  stuck  on a level from which you
can't progress.
        With this type of game, design is everything. The music is bog
standard, the graphics are bright  and  functional, but not really eye
€catching, but the game  oozes  playability.  Real  effort has been put
into each level, so that there  is  a different challenge awaiting the
player ever time they move on to  the  next stage. The problem with so
many puzzle games is  that  they  are  too  repetitive, Chip's doesn't
suffer from this problem.
        The main criticism I would make is  that there are a couple of
levels which  are  slightly  monotonous,  involving  a  repetitive and
difficult task to be done in a tight  time level. There is a fine line
between excitement and frustration, and these are on the wrong side of
that line. But this levels are  few  and  the  majority of the game is
highly entertaining. I also doubt that  you  will want to play through
the game once you have completed it,  but that is a criticism that can
be levelled and many games.
        Overall this game  comes  highly  recommended  as  one  of the
finest Lynx games. It seems to  work  better  on  the Lynx than on the
home computers, and  you  will  take  many  long  hours  attempting to
complete the 144 levels. This is really  an essential buy for all lynx
owners.

SECOND SIGHT: (Nice Guy Eddie)
        I am, pretty much,  in  total  agreement  with  my good friend
Leon.(For once!)
        Chips is an  excellent  game  for  anyone  who enjoys thinking
logically.  It is frustratingly  addictive  and  will  keep you up all
night to get through one moderately  difficult level, to gain the code
for the next.  These codes became life-threateningly important and the
torn scraps of paper  you  scrawl  them  on  to  will give you endless
headaches when you find they are  not  where you tossed them the night
before and a frantic search eventually turns  them up, among a pile of
books your mum 'tidied up' after you.

        No time has been  wasted  on  the  sound  or  graphics, but it
doesn't spoil the gameplay too  much  (as  long  as you turn the sound
down) and you will soon  be  too  busy  trying  to work out the latest
puzzle, to notice them.
        Some of  the  more  memorable  levels,  which  took  countless
attempts to complete, include:
€        a giant maze (yes, you still have the time limit!)
        one called 'on the rocks', in which you have to push blocks of
dirt, to make bridges, onto  water  squares, which cover approximately
95% of the screen - frustration rules!!!!!!!
        one called 'blobnet' in which  you  have  to get chips between
monster blob's rooms and when you collect each chip the way behind you
becomes more difficult as the blobs walkway's become bigger.

SLIME WORLD
===========
        You are the intrepid  Todd,  who,  after finding an incomplete
ship's log which tells of  a  planet  of slime, (unsurprisingly called
slime world) decides to go there on  the off chance that he might find
a few slimy gems -  another  wonderful  storyline  to go in the 'Great
Storylines of Our Time' book!
        Anyway, you have a choice of  six exciting and oh so different
adventures, in each you basically  have  to  find the exit and perhaps
collect a few gems on the  way.   The  only  one which differs to this
scenario is adventure 4  -suspense-  in  which  you  have to go around
picking magic mushrooms (!) to stop the planet exploding.
        Adventures 1,2 and 3 are almost identical, 6 would be as well,
but it's got no restarts, 4 is suspense and 5 is my personal favourite
€logic-  you have no gun,  but  must  use  your brains, that's why Leon
finds this one VERY difficult!!
        On each adventure you will bump  into a whole wobbling heap of
slime monsters including: maggots, headsuckers, tapeworms, bloodflies,
drools, spitters, octospids etc. etc.  Along  the  way you can pick up
lots of useful items to help combat these rather gruesome adversaries:
slime shields stop you  being  harmed  by   them  or their slimy spit,
cleansers- turn slime pools into water  pools  so  you can have a wash
(wish Leon would  take  this  advice)  jetpacks,  slime bait- attracts
monsters to it when you throw it, mega bombs -use with caution!- and
also gun power ups.
        There are  also  various  types  of  slime  to  be  found, the
commonest being green and normal, but  brown  slime is slow slime, icy
slime makes you slip and red  slime  makes you bounce!  But beware the
slime is not always what  it  seems  and  you  may find yourself going
through the slimy floor or wall into a new, unexplored section.
        You start with a gun  (except  on  5)-which  is a water pistol
because water is  the  only  thing  that  destroys  slime-  and also a
computer map which you can  access  anytime  during your adventure and
will show you part of the  intricate  labyrinths that are slime world.
You also have an option called-'poo!'- and  if you can't work out what
this does just try it and see!

        There is no music, just basic  sound effects, but the graphics
are very well done and Todd turns greener as more slime sticks to him.
The gameplay is  normal,  not  amazing,  not  crap,  but  I must admit
boredom sets in fairly rapidly after a week or two of solid playing.
        I don't really play it any more,  but now and then I'll dig it
out of my cupboard and er kick some slime!!

SECOND SIGHT: (Leon)

        Slime World! A world full  of  slime (sounds like my bedroom).
Mixed opinions about this one  really.  The different missions do give
the game variety and lasting  appeal.  The  restart  points are a good
idea, but mean that three of the  six missions are completable on your
first attempt. The multiplayer  mode  (at  least  in  two player mode)
€doesn't work as well as that  of  other  games. It is not as immediate
as, say, Xenophobe or Checkered Flag.  Perhaps this improves with more
than two  players  lynxed  up,  but  unfortunately  I  didn't  get the
opportunity to try this.
        The Lynx's capabilities are used  well  in  this game - almost
everything on screen  is  moving:  creatures,  walls  and backgrounds!
There is also  a  stunning  shadow-of-the-beast-esque  intro sequence.
This isn't too surprising since the  Lynx's creators, Epyx, coded this
game.
        Overall an interesting game  with  some original elements. The
different missions should keep  you  playing  for  some time, but this
game won't be to everyone's taste. Try before you buy.

ZARLOR MERCENARY
================

Zarlor Mercenary  is  a  vertically  scrolling  shoot-em-up  with  the
obligatory power ups and end of  level  guardians.  It is not going to
win any prizes for originality, but  even though I've seen hundreds of
games from this genre, very few of  them are actually any good. The ST
especially lacks good shoot-em-ups (Wings  of  death being perhaps the
only exception). The lynx has the  hardware  to  carry off a game like
this with ease, so it is a bit  of a surprise that there isn't more of
€them on the machine.

Zarlor scrolls one pixel vertically constantly, but the level is wider
than the screen and by flying to  edges you can scroll left and right.
This adds a lot of depth  to  the  game  as targets and enemies can be
hidden off screen.

The only hint of originality in this  game is in the scoring and power
up system. When you shoot enemies you  get  not score but money (or as
the manual says, 'Zarbits'.  Strange  people)  which  you can spend on
extra weapons at the end of level  shop.  So the more you destroy, the
more you can upgrade your ship. This  does  add to the gameplay as you
are constantly seeking targets  and  in  multiplayer  mode you compete
with you pals for the cash.

Special mention must be made to  the graphics - they are breathtaking.
The opening level is especially impressive with 3D shadows for all the
sprites and some impressive  ground  structures. Nearly everything can
be destroyed.

Each level  features  different  backgrounds,  different  sprites  and
requires a different  strategy.  You  also  have  the  choice of seven
different pilots when you start  the  game.  The main difference being
that they start  with  different  power-ups,  these  being laser, wing
cannons, power shots, shot speed, back shot, side shooters and speed.

The laser is a useful  addition  to  your  arsenal. When installed you
simply tap 'B' and a laser homes in on your nearest opponent. Smooth.

Once you start  really  playing  this  game  you  soon  find out which
weapons to start with, which power  ups  to  buy and you quickly learn
the sprite paths. I made progress  to  level six fairly quickly (but I
haven't yet completed it) so its  lasting  appeal is open to question.
But hey, when you're having this much fun, who cares?

Brilliant graphics, top tunes and barrel-load of violence is usually a
recipe for greatness and Zarlor Mercenary is  a big pudding of a game.
€Savour each mouthful.

Second Sight - however blind!
=============================
I really shouldn't be reviewing Zarlor Mercenary since we've only just
met, sort of.
        It's a shot-em-up and me and  them  don't get on  well even at
the smoothest of times!  It's  basically a vertically scrolling 'Gates
of Zendicon', but the background graphics are more impressive.
        This is SO  unoriginal  it  makes  me  laugh,  the  shop  is a
complete rip-off of Xenon  and  the  actual  game  is a combination of
thousands of over-head, scrolling shoot-em-ups like artificial dreams,
slap fight and others on the ST!
        Still, for those who like this type  of game they will find it
entertaining enough, with good graphics, sound and playability it will
be a hit with most Lynx owners.

KLAX
=====

        Sound 10 immediately!!!
        Now on to the  story  line,  which  will  not be very accurate
since I've lost  the  manual!   Anyway,  here  it  is,  you  have been
€warned!:

Many years ago, in a land that  time forgot, oh sod that bollocks! Try
again.....
        Dave was a tiler, and he  was  also a speccy fan, consequently
the walls he tiled clashed  in  colour  because  he  only had about 12

different coloured tiles and they were bright colours like magenta and
cyan.
        He always got bored half  way  through  tiling a wall and went
off to play his speccy, so  the  tiles  always  slid off the walls and
fell onto the floor.  For tiles, being horizontal was a new experience
and they got to like it so much that they decided to revolt and go and
tile a floor.  Dave got very upset  when  his tiles went missing so he
decided, no matter where they were,  he  would find and catch them all
so he could put them back into their single-colour piles.

        I know, I know but it's probably better than the original!

        Anyway onto the game, you control a paddle, capable of holding
5 tiles at a time, and  must  catch  tiles  that come down towards the
bottom of the screen at ever increasing rates.
        Depending on the 'wave' you will have to get either klaxes-  3
or more tiles in a horizontal or vertical  row, or in a diagonal, or a
certain number of points or just  catch  a number of tiles.  No matter
what you have to do, it  gets  harder  towards  the end and tiles drop
before you can catch them.
        There are a variety  of  different  backgrounds,  but the main
graphics are functional rather than artistic  and the tile colours are
speccy-esc!
        The gameplay is addictive and easy to pick up, but it does get
difficult relatively quickly and gets  almost  as frustrating as chips
(but not as addictive) when you only  have  four more tiles to get but
you drop too many and die.
        The main feature of Klax has to  be the music which is amazing
and, on the lynx 2, is in stereo.
        Overall it is a pretty good  game, original and addictive if a
€bit repetitive.

SECOND SIGHT: (Leon)

Klax has little to do with clocks or  clogs  and a lot to do with fun.
It is often said that the simplest  games are the best, but this isn't
true as Footbag is very simple and also very crap.

There isn't  much  variation  in  the  Klax  gameplay,  and  this will
eventually lead to boredom creeping in.  The game itself must be small
as they've stuffed the  cart  with  all  manner  of  samples and sound
effects making this a real aural treat - stereo sound too for us lucky
Lynx II  owners.  (This  had  nice  guy  Eddie  crying  into  his Lynx
classic!)

There are better puzzlers on the Lynx, Shanghai for instance, but Klax
is well worth having in your  collection,  if  only to demo the Lynx's
underused sound facilities. So pop to  you  local Lynx seller, pick up
this cart and join the Klu Klax Klan.
