  The only thing we don't supply is the birds! That's up to you
  sunbeam. And the ROADMUGGER has a number of exclusive feature
  that you'll find on no other car.  Like the revolutionary new
 'Cyclist Deterrent'. Yes, the Queen Boadicea revolving hub sword
      allows you to clear the road at the flick of a switch.
  AND THAT'S NOT ALL! Every Roadmugger comes fully equipped with
   100% tungsten, explosive-tipped bumpers. When you drive into
                   people they really know it.

   Other cars may try and tempt you with quadrphonic sound. But
   with the Roadmugger's massive six-speaker 'You What?' sex-a-
 phonic-sound-system, you'll really be able to hear Metalica, and
  so will everybody whithin a ten mile radius. Yes,theonlything
  louder than the tape machine is the horn. Or should we say the
  BRASSSECTION? Because you've got the Royal Philharmonic under
  the bonnet, with a full repertoire of classical tunes, Colonel
 Bogey, La Cucaracha, Dixie and many many more. And, what's more,
                 every ONE note in FOUR is WRONG.
 But what about the engine? All you need to know is IT'S BIG AND
  IT'S LOUD, and it does about a hundred yards to the gallon, so
      you'll be able to spend plenty of time in the garage.
    As you can imagine, an engine like the Roadmugger's needs
     an ostentatious gear system. And they don't come anymore
                     ostentatious than this.
  ROADMUGGER'S unique BIG SEVEN gear box. Yes that's seven SEVEN
gears, fourth, fifth, sixth, reverse, up, submerge, hyperspace and
  eight. Yes, EIGHT. Even while you've been reading this, we've
    added a new gear. In the Roadmugger you'll arrive at your
            destination before you've even left home.
  And you're guaranteed screaming tyres every time YOU PULL AWAY
 with our MAD BABOONDY NAMICINSTA SQUEAL feature. ( Optional wheelie
                   facility on deluxe models.)

  Yes, driving's a pleasure again with the Roadmugger. We've even
built in a computerized voice synthesizer which actually gives you
                 driving tips as you race along.
              Getting close to the driver in front?
               The on-board computer will tell you,
                   "GO on, cut the bastard up!"
       Yes, it's programmed with the full range of driving
                         hints, including
              " Check out the bird in the Ferrari",
                 "Get aload of the arse on that",
                       and " Die, Learner".
   And if you go for the Roadmugger De-luxe, you'll be able to
  enjoy it's self-cleaning radiator grille, which saves you the
  bother of removing all those tirsome insects, twigs, cats and
                 dogs, Minis and police officers.
