
        The complete solution to Leisuresuit Larry III
           by Tero Pukkinen (DDT of Kruz) 

        
                    Hello folks !

 Here comes the (almost) complete solution to another great
 Sierra game, Leisuresuit Larry III.
 With these instructions you'll catch 3970 points out of 4000
 possible. I've earlier played full 4000 points, but I don't
 remember what the fuck is missing now (sorry about that) ! 
 I played this game for many weeks and had many desperate
 situations but finally it's solved.
 The most important rule to remember in Sierra games is that
 the solution to situation is always simple !
 So simple that you wouldn't even think about it ! 

 -The commands which you will have to type in are all written in
  capital letters, e.g. the first command you should type in is
  'USE BINOCULARS' !

- I have used the cardinal points at the following way :
  North - Up
  South - Down
  East - Right
  West - Left
   e.g. Walk to east means that you'll have to leave the screen
   from right side of the screen   or
   Take the lower western path means that you'll have to leave
   the screen from the left side using the lower path.
    I hope you won't have problems with those !
   
 And now the actual game instructions. Load the game and ...
   Have fun with this great game !

 Of course you want to play at the dirtiest level so pick the
 age 'over 25'. To activate the cheat mode in question screen 
 just keep pushing the buttons 'Ctrl+Alt+Z+X+Space' until there
 appears a box to the screen. Type in '5' and you're allowed to
 play at the 'Totally Raunchiest level'.

 Walk to the binoculars (left one) and 'USE BINOCULARS'. After
 that "sight-seeing" 'READ THE PLAQUE' at the centre of the 
 screen. 'LEAVE THE PLAQUE' and walk to east (out of the screen).
 Keep walking and pass the bush from the right side (just follow
 the sign). Now you should be talking to Kalalau ... Your girl
 did just leave you for another man ! Well, actually she left you
 for another Woman (bloody lesbian) ! Leave the screen ... Take
 the lower path to east ... After "Super man trick" take again
 the lower eastern path ... Follow the sign pointing to west ...
 Enter the building ... Now just follow the happenings for a 
 while ... Out of a job, too ! Leave the screen ... To west (the
 upper one !) ... West (upper) ... You should now see a piece of
 wood lying on the ground. 'TAKE THE WOOD' ... West (upper path)
 'OPEN MAILBOX' and 'LOOK IN MAILBOX'. 'TAKE THE ENVELOPE'. Hey,
 now you have a credit card ! ... East ... East (lower) ... East
 (lower) and now to south. There should be a blondie lying on 
 the beach. Walk to her and wait until the souvenir-guy has left
 ... Then 'LOOK AT GIRL' and 'TALK TO HER'. 'GIVE CREDIT CARD TO
 HER' and have a happy fucking ! ... Bloody guy ! Always 
 interrupting, but at least you got a nice Ginsu knife ... After
 your crab dance leave the screen. 'SHARPEN THE KNIFE ON THE
 STAIRS' and 'CARVE THE WOOD'.
 Now walk to west (upper) ... There are two ways to east. The 
 lower one where you just came from and the upper one. Take
 the upper one (walk towards the rock at the centre of the
 screen and then walk straight to right. Yes, that's the upper
 eastern way). 'CUT THE GRASS WITH KNIFE' at the centre of the
 screen and 'WEAVE A SKIRT' ... South ... Lower path to east ...
 Walk straight to right (behind the stairs) ... Walk to sink,
 'DRINK' and 'TAKE THE SOAP'. Enter the first door of the cabana
 and 'WEAR GRASS SKIRT' ... West ... Back to Tawni (south). She
 buys your Erotic Sculpture (By the way, go and buy Audio
 Sculpture by SYNC ! Really great tracker !) ... Back to cabana
 (upper eastern  way), take the first door and 'WEAR SUIT'.   
 Leave the screen ... Enter the casino ... North ... West ...
 'LOOK AT THE MIRROR' and keep walking to west ... Now it would
 be wise to SAVE your GAME ... 'TALK TO MAN' and 'SHOW TICKET TO
 MAN'. Probably you don't have the original game (it's worth of
 buying) and so you don't have the guide book, but I have listed
 the pass numbers:
   Page   Number
    3     00741
    5     55811
    6     30004
    9     18608
   10     25695
   11     32841
   12     00993
   15     09170
   18     49114
   19     33794
 
 (A hint! You can make the game much more exciting by trying to 
 guess the pass number !)
 Enter the correct pass number and 'GIVE MONEY TO MAN' ... The 
 actual "show" is absolutely boring. Take a coffee break or 
 something ... After show walk to east until there comes a girl
 out of the door. Walk to her and 'LOOK AT GIRL'. 'TALK TO HER'
 ... 'GIVE LAND TO HER'. Then leave the screen ... East ... 
 South ... South ... West (upper) ... There's a way leading to
 north. Take that way ... Enter the office ... 'TALK TO MAN'
 and 'ASK ABOUT DIVORCE' ... Walk to the couch and 'SIT'. 'TALK
 ABOUT DIVORCE', 'STAND UP' and leave the room ... Leave the 
 office ... South ... Now take the upper eastern way ... East .
 .. Enter the building ... 'TALK TO MEN' at the left table (You
 can say whatever you feel like saying). Walk to the table at
 the centre of the screen and 'SIT'. Enjoy the show (read all
 jokes!) ... 'STAND UP' and leave the club ... West ... South .
 .. North ... Enter the office ... 'ASK ABOUT THE DEED' from 
 the man. After he has given it to you leave the office ... 
 South ... Lower eastern ... Enter the casino ... North ... 
 West ... West ... 'KNOCK THE DOOR' and ...... 'DANCE' ... 
 Leave the screen (to east) ... East ... South ... South ...
 West (upper) ... North ... Enter ... 'GIVE MONEY TO MAN' and
 ...... Leave the office ... Now walk back to the casino. You
 should already know the way ... Enter the casino ... North ...
 West ... West ... 'OPEN THE DOOR' ... 'TAKE SUIT' and leave
 this place (to east) ... East ... East ... South ... South ...
 To the beach (south) ... 'USE TOWEL' and 'STAND UP' right away
 when you have 777 points ... Again back to the lawyers office
 ... 'ASK ABOUT THE PAPERS'. Leave the office when you have the
 papers ... 'LOOK AT THE PAPERS' ... South ... Then the lower
 path to west ... Now you should see a big whale. Enter it ...
 'USE THE KEYCARD' to the door at the western wall ... You 
 should see lotsof lockers. SAVE your GAME! 'TURN THE KEYCARD'.
 There's your locker number (69) plus some names of Nontoonyt
 businesses. This is another time when you need your guide book
 (Do you have it?). I have listed the correct numbers below. 
 Keep in mind the names of the businesses (also the order) and
 try to 'FIND LOCKER 69'. Follow the hints. When you've found
 the locker, 'OPEN LOCKER' and type in the correspondence 
 number of the businesses mentioned on the card (remember the
 correct order).

 If you opened the locker succesfully, 'LOOK IN THE LOCKER',
 'TAKE SWEATS' and 'CLOSE THE LOCKER'. Walk in from the right
 door ... 'USE' the equipments until you have done 10 exercises
 per each equipment. Now you should have 1169 points ?! Leave
 the screen ... Walk into your locker, 'OPEN LOCKER' once more
 and 'WEAR TOWEL'. 'CLOSE THE LOCKER' and walk in from the left
 door ... 'TURN ON THE SHOWER', 'USE SOAP' and 'TURN OFF THE 
 SHOWER'. Leave the room ... Walk back into your locker and
 'OPEN LOCKER'. 'DRY YOURSELF', 'USE DEODORANT', 'TAKE SUIT' 
 and 'CLOSE THE LOCKER'. Leave the locker room (east) ... 'USE
 THE KEYCARD' to the northern door ... A monster ? No, actually
 it's a girl ! 'LOOK AT THE GIRL', 'HELP BAMBI WITH THE VIDEO'
 and ...... Leave the Fat City (south) ... East ... East(upper)
 ... Enter the cave (west) ... 'TAKE ORCHIDS' but be careful,
 you may faaaaaal ! Leave the cave (west) ... 'MAKE LEI'. South
 ... East (lower) ... Enter the casino ... North ... East ... 
 East ... 'SIT' and 'LOOK AT THE GIRL'. 'GIVE DECREE TO PATTI',
 'GIVE LEI TO PATTI' and 'MAKE LOVE WITH PATTI'. 'STAND UP' and
 leave this room (south) ... West ... South ... South ... West
 (upper) ... East (upper) ... East ... Enter the club ... 'TAKE
 WINE BOTTLE' and leave the club ... Walk back to casino ...
 Enter the casino ... East ... 'PUSH THE BUTTON' ... 'PICK 
 FLOOR 9' ... 'POUR OUT THE WINE' and now just follow what's 
 happening for a while ...... The situation has changed. Now 
 you steer Patti and your job is to find Larry again ... 'TAKE
 THE BOTTLE'. Walk into back of your dressing screen and 'TAKE
 BRA', 'TAKE PANTIES', 'TAKE PANTYHOSE', 'TAKE GOWN' and leave
 your room (south) ... 'PICK FLOOR 1' ... West ... North ... 
 East ... East ... 'TAKE MARKER', 'TAKE TIPS' and leave the 
 screen (south) ... West ... South ... South ... West (upper)
 ... East (upper) ... 'GIVE TIPS TO MAN' ... 'SIT' and 'THROW
 PANTIES TO MAN' ... Wait a minute until the man comes to you
 and sits. Then 'LOOK AT MAN' and 'TALK TO HIM'. You have no
 further business with him so 'LEAVE', 'STAND UP' and leave
 this place (east) ... East ... East ... SAVE your GAME now ...
 Pass the rock and walk into bamboo forest ... There will be
 lotsof bamboo and you will have to follow the instructions
 very carefully. Don't lose time ! ... North - N - E - E - N
 (Yes, there's way to north!) - W - N - E - N - N - N - W (Now
 it's time to 'DRINK THE WATER') - W - S - W - W - N - N - W -
 N (Goal!) ... 'DRINK WATER'. Be careful ! To north ... Walk 
 towards the rock at the edge of the canyon, 'TAKE OFF 
 PANTYHOSE' and 'FASTEN PANTYHOSE TO ROCK' ... Wham! You're on
 the cliff (I bet that wouldn't work on real life?!) ... 'CLIMB
 THE TREE', 'TAKE NUTS' and 'CLIMB DOWN'. 'TAKE LEAVES' and 
 'MAKE A ROPE'. 'LASSO ROCK'. Don't move ! 'TIE ROPE TO TREE'.
 'MAKE HARNESS' and 'CROSS THE CHASM' ... Leave the screen 
 (first walk a bit to west, then turn to north) ... Walk to 
 north until a pig attacks ! Walk to west so that the pig can't
 reach you. 'TAKE OFF BRA', 'PUT NUTS INTO BRA' and 'SWING BRA'
 Walk to north ... Now it's time to SAVE your GAME. There will
 be an arcade-action game ! And extremely difficult one (I 
 think). It's wise to save your game many times during the 
 arcade game. You can also bypass the arcade-action but then
 you'll lose 150 points. Try it ! ...
 'PULL LOG' and 'MOUNT LOG' ... Steer with the cursor keys (to 
 right and left). And save often ! ......
 At the cage with Larry 'USE THE MARKER' ... Walk to north 
 (Studio C) ... East ... Fly towards the button and 'TURN OFF
 THE MACHINE'. That's it ! All you have to do is walk to east 
 and watch !
