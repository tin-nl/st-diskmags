                              PREVIEW

          And other PSYGNOSIS related news by CIH 14/4/91

Isn't   it   nice  how  fate  (and  extended   MAGGIE   production 
deadlines,,)  allows you to develop a story which you thought  out 
of  reach  of  the  current  issue,  in  this  case,  the  current 
developments of the Scouse softco PSYGNOSIS...

In  the previews for this issue,  I said it would be nice to  hear 
about  some ST releases as they have a tendency to write  for  the 
Commodore  thing  first  (retch!) with the  ST  version  following 
sometime later.  Now,  it transpires there is a flurry of activity 
on a number of releases, first of which, is THE KILLING GAME SHOW, 
which I have had a chance to play with.

I  had  a go at a level one preview,  which nevertheless  gives  a 
pretty good taster of the full game, so here goes...

The  basic  scenario is yourself as a player involved  in  violent 
future  entertainment,  the KILLING GAME SHOW of the title,  where 
the  aim  is to BLAST EVERYTHING IN SIGHT whilst  negotiating  the 
upward  maze  of platforms in order to avoid the  steadily  rising 
DEADLY TO ORGANIC LIFE liquid,  the slightest contact with it will 
lose the life in play.

Fair enough,  I say, although we are not informed of the BIG PRIZE 
received if you win, probably another bloody boring Vauxhall Nova, 
or  luxury  pine-effect  kitchenette,  or a  two-week  holiday  in 
Chernobyl.  Worse  still,  is the thought of who would host a show 
like  this,  all the current crop of gameshow hosts are dire,  the 
natural  candidate for the KILLING GAME SHOW would be  Bob  'Roger 
Mellie' Monkhouse, a frightening and repulsive thought eh!!

Still,  I digress,  the game itself is quite appealing to look at, 
you  are represented by an ED201-type 'Bad guy' droid as  seen  in 
ROBOCOP  and  you  progress through a level  one  landscape  which 
resembles  the  organic creations of the Bitmap  Bros,  everything 
being reflected in the purple 'Deadly to Organic Life' liquid. You 
go along,  shooting up waves of aliens again, very much like those 
in  XENON II and picking up helpful objects,  and keys to open  up 
different parts of the level,  all of this takes place against the 
steadily rising liquid,  gradually cutting-off parts of the level, 
so  speed  is essential...  There are plenty of  useful  powerups, 
which give extended shots for a limited time,  or extra energy, or 
even the less than useful RED HERRINGS that appear....

Graphically,  as  mentioned  before,  this game is of a very  high 
standard, as you would expect from PSYGNOSIS, and does not seem to 
have lost anything in translation from the Amiga version,  I would 
assume  there is more variety in terms of background  scenery  and 
alien types in the different levels of the full game..

The  sound aspect is represented by a stand-in tune for the  demo, 
which  isn't much to write home about,  and will be replaced by  a 
sampled title tune, whilst there is also a quite good in-game tune 
which  is similar to a MAD MAX creation,  and is probably the  in-
game music for the actual game itself...

Also  to look forward to on the actual game is a 600-odd  kilobyte 
'Ray-Traced  intro sequence' Overall,  an interesting high-quality 
work, which I  believe is out in the shops now..

Moving  on,  it  appears  that LEMMINGS has actually made  its  ST 
release,  as  of  this  week,  a  game which has  been  critically 
acclaimed   on  the  Amiga  for  its  unique  style  and   extreme 
playability..  Expect  nothing to be lost in translation to the ST 
here...

Another Amiga original which is getting close to release on the ST 
is  AWESOME.  Amazingly enough,  it has apparently translated very 
well to the ST,  this being a game which supposedly showed off the 
superiority  of  the Amiga custom-chip set,  and depended on  them 
heavily  to  make  it work....  Just shows that the ST  can  still 
perform with the help of its dedicated programming community...

Another  due  soon is ARMOURGEDDON,  a 3-D solid vector job,  with 
several  modes of transport,  it will be interesting to see how it 
stands up in this particularly competitive area of ST gaming...

Finally,  a  word  on  possible future developments,  such as  the 
PSYGNOSIS  involvement  in CD-ROM,  initial screenshots of a  game 
under   development  indicate  a  megastonking   release,   almost 
certainly a game to reckon with.  The situation being a game which 
will  look  like one of their superb  movie-like  digitised  intro 
sequences  FOR  THE  WHOLE  GAME,  as they will  have  500  or  so 
Megabytes to play with on a CD-ROM.  Let us hope that it will have 
the  playability  to match (or any sort of  playability  for  that 
matter...)  The really interesting thing is that it is  not  being 
developed  for any specific format,  and can be adapted to run  on 
any machine with a CD-ROM drive...

For example,  the screenshots released from their first game under 
development  look like something off a Chris Foss book cover,  and 
appears  to  be  an ultra-futuristic flight sim set  in  an  alien 
desert landscape........

ATARI,  ARE YOU LISTENING!!!!  This could make your CD-ROM drive a 
worthwhile  proposition,  as  opposed to an expensive  curiosity.. 
Watch this space.........

Overall, much welcome activity after months of silence from a good 
and innovative softco,  keep up the good work, and best of luck on 
those future projects guys.....
