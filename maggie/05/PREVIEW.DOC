By 'Him agane'

Firstly, the WELL DONE awards to the following, VAXINE, SPINDIZZY, 
XIPHOS,  CORPORATION,  POWERMONGER,  and B.A.T. for making it out, 
and  onto  the shelves,  some of these even in the  period  before 
Xmas!!  SPINDIZZY being reviewed in Maggie issue 4, and two of the 
others being reviewed in this issue (no.5 of course...)

After,  what  were  a  bunch of very lame  Xmas  releases,  mostly 
licenceware,      most      new     games     being     of     the 
CHASEHQESWATNINJAEDDTHEDUCKREMIX PART II sort of calibre... We are 
now looking to the next wave of good releases taking place  around 
March (Easter is 'early' this year..)                      

Confidently expected are such items as HUNTER by Activision, a 3-D 
solid vector driven thing,  where you have total freedom to wander 
around  in a 3-D landscape,  which is contoured very much like the 
one  in  VIRUS,  and  play around with cars,  boats,  helicopters, 
bicycles,  tanks,  etc.  You can also enter the buildings that are 
there,  and from the demo preview on the ZERO magazine cover disk, 
this  is  a very good attempt at a 3-D 'virtual world' (It  has  a 
three minute timer on it though - boo!!) It will be interesting to 
see how it compares with MIDWINTER II - FLAMES OF FREEDOM which is 
to   be  released  shortly...   It  certainly  seems  to  be  more 
immediately  'accessible'  than  a lot of other  3-D  games,  Full 
review when it is out in a future Maggie..

The  early release of HUNTER depends if Activision can  pull  it's 
financial fat out of the fire,  as you are aware,  they are having 
major   troubles,   and   cutting  back  severely  on   their   UK 
operations...

MIDWINTER  II - FLAMES OF FREEDOM is getting a ton and a  half  of 
pre-release coverage,  I actually don't mind the hype this time as 
it  purely  deals  with the depth and quality of  the  program.  A 
three-disk  effort,  and you are talking hours just to explore all 
the features in the game, again, expect a full review here when it 
is released...

With the Domark/Incentive 3-D Construction kit (CASTLEMASTER  etc) 
due  later  in the year,  and the latest Assembly line  production 
CYBERCOM  III   due out soon as well,  it seems that  3-D  virtual 
enviroments  are the gaming flavour of the next few months.  Which 
is fine by me!!!

Then there is EPIC,  Which is on for a spring release??? and which 
has  been  the subject of the lavish screenshot treatment  in  ACE 
magazine,  with  confident  assertions that theirs is the  fastest 
smoothest 3-D system around... So lets see it soon please guys!!!

KILLING CLOUD,  due 'out soon' is the subject of personal interest 
by Mirror Group owner,  Capt Robert "Litigation King" Maxwell Q.C. 
owing  to  it  having a somewhat  graphical  torture  scene..  The 
electrodes  have  now  been  removed at  the  request  of  Amnesty 
International, perhaps they can be reinstated in a future release, 
such as "Iraqi Torture Dungeon Simulator???"..  OK, I know torture 
isn't  funny,  so  by  way of penance here's a picture  of  Robert 
Maxwell


  (SPACE FOR PICTURE OF ROBERT MAXWELL.......)


There  is  also  GODS (BITMAPS - OUR LIFE!!!)  the  Bitmaps  first 
RENEGADE  release  which looks extremely good,  and promises  good 
things  in  the sound dept as well..  (Having taken the  graphical 
side  of  things to their limits,  they are looking to  boost  the 
sonix  of  the ST,  and promise to use the STE's  enhancements  as 
well...) Out for errm, Feb/March time....

Other thingies 'out soon' - ZARATHRUSTA, which is THRUST revisited 
with pretty graphics,  for people who like that sort of thing, SIM 
EARTH,  from  the people who did SIM CITY,  out 'Late Spring' (yes 
well..)  POPULOUS II,  out later this year..  (More 'Godly powers' 
than  before,  a third 'god' as well)..  Better not forget the man 
with  the titanium groin-restrainer in TURRICAN II (1500  screens, 
2mb  graphics,  400k  sound  (WOW!)) pupportedly better  than  the 
original,  with pre-release demos cropping up all over the place.. 
This  is  imminent as well,  strangely enough....  (It is out as I 
speak in fact, well done people !!!)

CORPORATION  is out,  and a 'mission disk' containing several more 
levels and new adversaries is promised,  ENCHANTED LANDS,  and the 
LOST BOYS GAME are due soon from THALION,  the latter has 'work in 
progress'  at  this  very moment...  Another 'due  soon  case,  is 
DRAGONS LAIR II - TIME WARP,  six disks and œ45 - AAAGH!!  One for 
desperately  insecure  poseurs everywhere (A lot of  Amiga  owners 
seem  to go for these Don Bluth/Readysoft creations,  just to show 
off at the computer clubs for some reason...)

It  is  a bit difficult to follow what PSYGNOSIS are  doing  these 
days,  as they are primarily releasing first on the Amiga,  but it 
would be nice to see an ST version of LEMMINGS, and interesting to 
see if they can convert AWESOME as well.... In fact, I gather that 
LEMMINGS and KILLING GAME SHOW are imminent on the ST...

MICROPROSE, apart from MIDWINTER II, are working on ST versions of 
F15  STRIKE EAGLE II and a GULF WAR mission disk for  F19  STEALTH 
FIGHTER ????????????????????Joke????????  Also KNIGHTS OF THE SKY, 
their  World War One flight-sim (No 'Beyond visual Range'  malarky 
here kiddies!!!)

Anyway, this will do for now, there are certainly some interesting 
releases in the next month or two, we may even see some of them!!

BYE for this article - CIH (C) Feb 91....

P.S.  Playing the demo of HUNTER, I hurtled over a steep hill in a 
car and squashed a seagull for minus 30 points.. Good eh!!!

P.P.S.  When is NEBULOUS II out, I believe the ST version is being 
programmed by our old friends Thalion...  Anyway,  this is another 
one which has gone rather quiet just lately....

P.P.P.S.  Hewson  have just gone into administrative receivership, 
(Ouch!) another victim of the recession, it seems....
