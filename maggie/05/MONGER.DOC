                        POWER MONGER! - THE DOC 
                        =======================


     Hello!   Bilbo is back with another space-filler.    This 
time the subject is....    Power Monger    Yeah!   Seeing as I 
have completed said game (Crowning date - 11th of March in the 
year  of our Lord 1991),  I thought some fellow Mongers  might 
like a few tips etc.  You think this is bad, I was going to do 
a Populous levels list (YAWN!).
     
     Anyway,  since just before Christmas, I have been playing 
this fabby game.  That is in between producing our little demo 
compacts - Ripped Off    (of course!).   So time has been at a 
premium.   But nevertheless,  here are my own little tips (I'd 
better start before I fall asleep reading my own text!).....

1.    As a general rule,  always Attack passively (one  dagger) 
      and Get Men aggressively (three daggers).   This  means 
      you  will kill less men when capturing the  village  and 
      therefore  be  able to recruit  more  into  your army.

2.    ALWAYS Get Food (aggressively).  No food means your army 
      will leave you.  No army   No Conquering.

3.    Always  Query  (the  question  mark)  a  village  before 
      attacking.  Your  10  man  army has  got  no  chance  of 
      conquering  a village with 30 people (unless you've  got 
      swords for example - more on weapons later).

4.    Keep an eye on your three status bars at the top of  the 
      screen.
      Blue (Top) - Food
      Red (Middle) - Men in your army
      Green (Bottom) - Your personal strength (Death if it disappears!)

5.    I usually use the fourth Map Icon (Food Mode) because  it 
      shows the settlements with the most food  (obviously!).  
      This  is         important when choosing where to  attack 
      next.   Don't forget  you need to update this every  so 
      often  as  it does change!  It  also  helps  to  locate 
      settlements if you're using a crap TV and the display is 
      a bit crappy.

6.    Another pretty obvious point is....    Save  your  game 
      after every major battle.   I've completed 4/5 of a game 
      and  been killed by fluke - without a saved  game  it's 
      pretty annoying!!

7.    Inventing....
      Passive - Boats (coracles!) 
                Ploughs 
                Pots 
      Neutral - Pikes
                Swords (when near a mine)
      Aggressive - Bows 
                   Catapults (Nice!)
                   Cannons (Very nice!)

      about the inventions....
      Boats - Needed if you want to cross water. One per soldier.
      Ploughs/Pots - Forget them!
      Pikes - Give you a combat ratio of about 2 to 1.
      Swords - Give you a combat ratio of about 3 to 1.
      Bows - Good long-distance weapon. Good for slaughtering!
      Cannons/Catapults - Boom! Mass destruction at your fingertips.
                            Only one per Captain.

8. If you are inventing, try to get a balance between bows and
   pikes/swords.  Bows are great for killing at distance but crap
   at close quarter combat.  Pikes/swords are for the front men who
   take up the initial charge.

9. If you have got lots of bows, try to attack from the top of a 
   hill because you gain the advantage.

10. Watch out for opposing armies (Red, Blue and Yellow) who are
    battling each other.  These guys are really stupid because they 
    never pick up any dropped weapons and food.  These appear after
    a battle if any dead soldiers were carrying weapons.  Food bags
    appear when a Captain has been killed (usually).

11. You can try making an Alliance, but this usually fails and is of
    little use unless the settlements has got loads of food or 
    weapons (then you can pick them up!)

12. If you are inventing and not under attack, try speeding up the
    game (under the Disk icon). This simply saves waiting time.

13. Personally, I only ever use captured Captains to spy on other
    armies.  They can be used to command troops, but communications
    are slow (it's only a pigeon when all is said and done!).

14. If food is low, try scanning the edges of the island for sheep.
    If a settlement has been conquered and contains no men, there 
    is no-one to herd the sheep and they wander off.

15. If you conquer a village and know there is a BIG army on your 
    tail, get the men, change to passive and attack a tree (for
    example). This means your army is safe and because you're
    passive, your army shouldn't try to defend the village.

16. You can get an army together and leave them on an island if
    you need to escape quickly.  Then you can search for boats and
    they will sail to you as you Equip with the boats.

17. Don't forget to look out for other armies Base Towers.  These
    often contain men and food.  But beware, they don't like it!

18. Attacking from the sea is often useful.  This usually leaves
    your Captain safely off shore so that no harm can come to him.

19. If a level is very difficult, try a way round it.  Try the
    island above or below.  You don't need to conquer them all,
    only the bottom right is mandatory if you want crowning.
    Also, retry levels if you get beaten straight away.  Hitting
    an army from another angle can often change the outcome.

20. Look out for lonesome Captains.  You sometimes find an enemy
    Captain sat around alone.  Kill the sucker and get his food/
    boats/weapons.  DON'T try to recruit him!!  

21. Sometimes an enemy Captain's army isn't fully equipped with 
    boats.  If he crosses water, this can leave him almost defence-
    less!  Attack him quickly.  His soldiers will then return to
    their original settlement.  Then go and attack that village and
    get the men!

22. If in doubt - RUN!!  You can always build up your army and return
    for a MASSACRE later!

23. If you are occupying a village and an army is approaching - 
    turn to Aggressive and wait.  If you go out to attack him, your
    Captain leads the way.  Dangerous.  If you wait, your men rush 
    out, leaving your Captain safe in the village.

24. Sacrifice captured Captains when necessary if it saves the skin
    of your main Captain.  They can die, but when your main Captain
    dies its....    GAME OVER!

25. A Final Tip.....    PERSEVERE!
    It's a bloomin' hard game at times.  I've had to totally miss
    some islands because they're so hard - but not without trying
    my best to beat it!  Keep trying and trying!

Well  there  you have it.   I am sorry these tips  are  in  no 
particular  order,  but  I hope they are of some use  to  some 
people.   As far as I know I am the first person to have  been 
crowned.   I  am sure I am not the first but am the  first  to 
announce it!!   If you know different, please let me know - we 
could try the 2 player option to settle it!!    Yeah!

     This game has given me MANY,  MANY hours of fun - as well 
as  some f**king headaches.   And I hope many more people  are 
playing  it.   It's  games of this quality that are  the  only 
chance of stopping software piracy!  I mean,  who wouldn't pay 
œ20-30  for  three  solid months of gameplay  (and  I  haven't 
finished  yet,   because  I'm  now  trying  to  fill  in   the 
unconquered islands!).
     
OK,  I rest my case.   I guess I'd now better get back to  the 
hard  work of releasing some more Ripped Off menus.  CD 92  is 
the next one I'm due to release,  so I hope you are all up  to 
date!  (HA! HA! Cheap plug or what?)

     See Ya and Keep Mongering!

     Ok,  Vill's  back trying to shave his legs with a butter  
knife,  so I'll take over for a while (or until I get bored -
whichever is shorter).
     Yes, Mr. O'Blib here to bore ya sox off for a bit.  Driving.....
BAD  Driving.....    You  know what I'm gonna say  now    F**king
Sierra drivers!!!     To   illustrate  my  point,   I'd  like  to
make  a   few classifications. They are as follows....

     a) Metro drivers
        Sex - Male
        Age - 95
        Attire - Anything as long as it includes a flat cap
        Attitude  -  I've been driving 76 years without  having  
                     had  an accident.
        Our Reply - Yes, but you've caused 100's you silly old goat!

     b) XR3i drivers
        Sex - Male
        Age - 45
        Hairstyle - None (usually bald or at least receding)
        Wife - A 19 year old blond tart
        Attire - Medallion, open-to-waist shirt, gold sovereign rings
                 (Leisure Suit Larry would drive an XR3i)     
        Attitude - My car is the sportiest, fastest car on the road and
                   I'm attractive to ALL women
        Our  reply - F**k off you old w*nker.  Get a Fiat Panda to  match 
                     your under-performing dick and over-performing ego

     c) Sierra drivers (...the one you've been waiting for!)
        Sex - Male
        Age - Any
        Attire - Shirt & tie. Half a wardrobe hanging on the hand rail.
                 Car phone (optional). 
        Attitude - They own the road so don't get in the way.  They  must 
                   pay more road tax cos they have priority in any  lane 
                   and don't need to indicate. Arrogant bastards who are 
                   unaware of any other road users. Permanently reclined
                   seats. Only use the inside lane on motorways - to 
                   overtake that is!
        Our reply - Apart from the Cosworth, these cars make the drivers
                    become  total  d*ck splashes.  There  is a theory  in 
                    certain circles that these people are dick  splashes 
                    anyway.  I  can't really say much more as  I'm  sure 
                    everybody has come across these tw*ts.

     Well, I think that covers most of the bad drivers on today's roads.
Your  comments and criticisms are welcomed.  Please state car  driven  in 
your reply.  You might as well lie if you've got a Sierra cos we're short 
of bog roll at the moment.

     And now, some hints and tips on good driving from Stick (don't worry 
Sierra drivers, no long words here!)
     
     Well then, what tips can I give you on how to become a good driver?

     Firstly and most importantly, DO NOT buy a Sierra,or even a Volvo.
(Oh  I'd forgotten about Volvo's....) Volvos,  (Or should that  be  their 
drivers?)  really  get on my nerves!  (Almost as much  as  bloody  Sierra 
Morons!)  They are the only vehiclees on the road which are driven  slower 
than  a  Metro.You'll be going along and you can  always  guarantee  that 
somewhere in the course of your journey a Bloody myopic  (Sierra drivers 
note- this means blind.) Volvo driver will suddenly pull out from a  side 
street  or  junction,causing  you  to sh*t  yourself  and  have  to  take 
immediate  avoiding action.  Have you noticed though,when they  pull  out 
it's  always when you're near.The road has been clear for  ages,but  they 
wait until you arrive and then try to plaster you onto the side of  their 
concrete reinforced veichle!
     But I suppose that's it, they have car which can plough into a large 
coach head on at 70mph,killing all the passengers and the Volvo only  has 
a  slight  dent in the front bumper!  The driver knows he can  cause  aqn 
accident and be totally unharmed.The bloody Ploks!

     Volvo's- Built by robots, Driven by dummies.

     Good driving tips:-

1)  Always  have a crisp œ10 note folded in the middle  of  your  driving 
licence,so  that  when PC B*st*rd pulls you for driving while  wearing  a 
brightly  coloured shirt,  he will see it when you show him your  licence 
and hopefully he may not book you.

2)  Always  make sure you warm up your veichles  engine  properly before 
setting off on your journey.  This can be done by  revving the nuts off
  it  for  at least 10 minutes while parked  outside  your  house.This  I 
guaranteed to get you lots of admiring glances from all your neighbours...

3)   Burn off as many Sierra drivers as possible and when one is  up  your 
chuff in the outside lane of the motorway,  slow down,  this is guaranteed 
to amuse him highly!

4)   Always make plenty of room for motorcycles,('cos they're gonna rip 
past you anyway!)

     And  that's about it really.  I dunno if this is gonna go  down  too 
well in an ST disk mag,  but what the hell?  By the way, do we rate as the 
fastest crew on the ST?   On the road,  that is.   My car (yes, it's Bilbo 
again) is a Renault 5 GT Turbo (0-60 in 7.3 secs.), Vill's got an XR2i (0-
60 in 8.1 secs.) and Stick's got some f**k off bike that does it in  about 
3 point something!  If any crews out there want a race, let us know. Until 
then, we must assume we are the fastest!

     Well,  enough trash talk for this article.  I'm sure you (the reader) 
have  got  something better to do than read this.  And I've  got  lots  of 
better things to do than write it!  

     So, it's BYEEE from the boys at Ripped Off......

Bilbo - Bye
Stick - Bye
Vill  - Bye
