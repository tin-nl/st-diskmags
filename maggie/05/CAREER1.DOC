   In  this article I will try to explain what you need to  do  or 
what not to do to get a job using your computer.  Is it as easy as 
it says in the magazines? Do you really earn that much? To help me 
write  this  article  I visited  Steve Bak to  find  out  what   a 
professional would do to sell a game.  From the visit I wrote this 
article.


  INTRODUCTION
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  There are very few hobbies that offer you the chance of making a 
living.  the amateur astronomer, or golfer can dream about turning 
professional  but there's little hope of those dreams  becoming  a 
reality.
   personal  computer  are  different,   especially  in   computer 
entertainment software,   and for the people capable of  producing 
it.   But it's worth stressing now,  breaking into the business is 
not easy as it used to be.  As Mr Bak mention " You can't just ask 
a company if they need a game writing,   you have to sell yourself 
to them ".
   Today,   the  software  business  is made up  of  a  string  of 
different  people  from coders to sales  personel,   It's  a  team 
effort involving managers,  designer,  graphic artists,  musicians 
and almost last programmers.
   Although there are still very talented individuals  capable  of 
producing fast code,  exelent graphics and perfect music they  are 
very much a minority.  Most programmers are salaried staffers, and 
that  usually  means working for another company  and  working  to 
somebody else's designs and timescales.
  With all these people working together how do they all get on ?

  THE CODER
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

   Once the programming of a game was everything.   Now it's  only 
part  of the process - a crucial part but only a  part.   Basicly  
the  coder takes somebody else's design  specification,   somebody 
else's music, somebody else's graphics and implements them into 
the code.
  The importance of which language you use is important.  It's  no 
good  being  a first class pascal programmer,  or a wizard  in  C.  
Virtually  all arcade games ( That more than 94% off all  games  ) 
must be written in machine code for speed of execution and compact 
size.   It's  also  useful  to have experience of  more  than  one 
machine.   since a lot of the programmers work in converting games 
from  one  machine  to another.  All employers will  want  to  see 
examples  of  your  work,   but  you don't have  to  show  them  a 
published game.  Most important of all you have to be able to work 
as a team.  

  THE ARTIST
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

   As  the  paying public  has  become  more  demanding,  computer 
entertainment has had to become more sophisticated.  The days have 
all  but  gone when featureless blobs whizzing  about  the  screen 
could be explained away in a stream of breathless packaging.
   Now  when  the  packaging  talks  of  gleaming  space  cruisers 
bristling  with  gun turrets,   the game player wants to  see  gun 
turrets.   When  the packaging talks about slime monster  dripping 
with venom the game player wants to see that venom drip.
  Computer gaming requires special talents of the artist, you must 
know the limitations of your computer and understand the  problems 
that a programmer might have.   The  artist really works under the 
programmer  and  the two must consult each other with  changes  to 
software.  Again  a knowledge of more than one computer  is  handy 
because  simply  by converting your graphics to  another  computer 
could get quite a bit of extra cash.

  THE MUSICIAN
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

   Musicians  are very much in demand for most  computers  because 
really you need a knowledge of machine code as well as the ability 
to  create  good  music.  Many game now have  digi-music  in  them 
because  it  sounds a lot better than the sound chip and  gives  a 
better impact.  If you can produce stunning pieces of music with a 
sound  tracker its a good idea to send them to show want you  cant 
do on a demo disk.   A good musician should be able use the  sound 
chip to its full and compose original pieces.


  OPTIONS OPEN TO YOU
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  In this section I will explain the different option you have  to 
sell your game or work for a company making them.


  FREELANCE OPTION
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  Although  there is a definite trend  towards  team  development,  
that  doesn't  mean  you  will have to become  a  nine  to  fiver.  
Although many companies insist on in house development,  there are 
still a considerable demand for freelance workers.
  The main difference between full time employment and freelancing 
is that as a freelance you are much better paid.   You don't  have 
the  security,  but you do have the opportunity to earn some  good 
money.   An in house programmer might earn around œ12,000 a  year, 
where  as you could easily earn œ12,000 doing two projects a  year 
which  might  take eight months.   As freelance you can  pick  and 
choose  the jobs you want just taking the ones that  intrest  you. 
You work your own hours,  usually where you choose.  The down side 
that  you don't get paid holidays,  or get paid sick  leave.   You 
must take a professional approach to the business, companies won't 
work  with  unreliable  people  - freelance  work  has  a  lot  to 
recommend  it.   The important thing to remember is that  you  are 
effectively running your own business,  acting as a sub-contractor 
to other companies.


  IN HOUSE OPTION
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  If it's a steady job you want with regular pay then you want  to 
work in house.   This means everything stops when you leave  work, 
theres  no taking work home with you and you also have to be  able 
to  work  even when you don't really want to.  Pay  is  less  than 
working  freelance  but  you  have  more  security  and  get  paid 
holidays.   If you join a software house or programming team  from 
school  you might start on an average salary of œ6-7,000  a  year.  
Within  a couple of years ( if you any good ) you could expect  to 
be earning about œ12,000 plus bonuses or royalites.  A  successful 
track record could take you higher and if your game is a hit,  for 
you  game you could pick up and extra œ5,000 or more in  a  single 
cheque.   However  the  number of games programmers  earning  over 
about œ20,000 a year is very low.  

  BREAKING IN
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  O.K.  so you've already made your game and want to sell,   there 
are quite a few ways of going about it.  Probably the most obvious 
thing  to do is write your game and totaly finish it.  This  means 
all the best of your ideas,  creating an original game which meets 
the  standard of the software industry.  Many companies will  only 
deal with finished games like SYSTEM 3, they are looking for games 
which are up to a very high standard of design and playability.
 Another thing to do is design your game,  this means full details 
of  what happens in the game showing snapshots and small  graphics 
of  what you think the game would be like.  If possible you  could 
send  a demo disk stating which machine its for etc.  If  you  are 
sending  a story plan try to make it look as professional  as  you 
can and make sure its clear.  Make sure the company knows you  are 
intending  to make the game for them,  otherwise they might  leave 
with  the money for designing it and that all.  The other  way  of 
selling  your  game  is to write half the game and send  it  to  a 
company asking for an advanced payment while you write the rest of 
the game.  This commits  the company to you and your game, but you 
must  show that your able to finish the game.   They  will  expect 
progress report and things like that.  But last but not least  you 
could  do what The Lost Boys,  TCB and many other did which is  to 
write demo's and get quite well known and just hope someone  spots 
your  tallent.  This  is good if your still at college  or  school 
because  it gives you a better chance when you leave.   One  large 
firm which picks the best demo crews and offers them a way to sell 
their  game,   The company is called THALION and they are base  in 
Germany.   It's  a good idea to try and get advice from people  in 
the  know,   I  tracked down where Steve Bak lived  from  ST  NEWS 
before I had read that I had no idea where he lived.


  WHERE TO GO
 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

   The  best  place  to find a company  is  in  a  magazine,  most 
companies supply  their address at the bottom of an advert . But I 
have made a list of companies I know :-

    I hope I have been of some help to one or two people.  I  must 
thank the following for their help :-   Steve Bak
