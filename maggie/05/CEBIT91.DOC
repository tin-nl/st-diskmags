'A short describtion of the most important facts for Atari users'


Hi guys!

This  year  it  is my job to give you a rough idea  of  what  has 
happened on and around the Atari stand on the Cebit  fair.  First 
of all some facts about the CeBIT'91:  25 halls were filled  with 
the  latest developements concerning micro-electronic  and  tele- 
comunication.  About  4600 companies came to show their  products 
and  also about 570 000 people came to watch these  things.  Some 
examples:  IBM,  NeXT, Apple, Epson and last but really not least 
ATARI!
When  entering  this "MEGA-EVENT" I first tried to  come  to  the 
Atari  stand  to  meet some friends (HI  TO  THE  RESPECTABLES!). 
Walking  through several halls I had to see the presentations  of 
some  MS-DOS companies and when I find the Atari stand I  thought 
"ATARI  ...  short but sweet and crowded!".  The small stand  was 
really crowded and a lot of visitors came to give Atari a chance.
The design of the stand was the same everybody should know. A big 
blue  "ATARI" symbol and a lot of little stands were we find MEGA
STs, MEGA STEs, TTs and ... oh yeah, .. to know the rest you have
to goon reading this boring article.

Before this fair nobody really knows about the things Atari  will 
present  and  some people start wondering if  Atari will  present 
anything new.

-. NEW ATARI HARDDISKS:
   Atari  presented several new harddiscs with different  capaci-
   ties from 83 to 676 megabyte memory.  The average access  time 
   is about 12 - 15 ms.

-. NEW ATARI TT MEMORY EXPANSIONS:
   The TT-users are now able to strengthen their machine up to 26 
   MByte main memory.  Now also CAD and DTP programs should  work 
   without any problems.

-. ATARI TT/030 WORKSTATION WITH UNIX:
   Now  you can also use the full UNIX power if you own a  TT/030 
   workstation.  The Developer Package V includes in addition  to 
   Unix V Rel.  4.0 a graphical user interface based on X/Windows 
   and OSF/Motif and the software tools GNU C, C++ and XFacemaker 
   II. 
          FACTS:    - Includes UNIX V, Release 4.0
                    - Includes elements of XENIX and BSD
                    - Virtual File System (VFS)
                    - X/Windows, Release 11.4
                    - Motif user interface
                    - C (Version 1.37)
                    - C++ (Version 1.37)
                    - Debugger, shells
               
          ONLY IN THE NETWORK VERSION:

                    - TCP/IP
                    - Remote File Sharing
                    - BSD sockets 

-. ATARI 19" MONITOR TTM 194:
   This  is the new CAD and DTP monitor for the ATARI TT  with  a 
   resolution  of 1280 x 960 pixels and a frame repeat  frequenzy 
   of  70  Hz. The  low electro-magnetic  radiation characterises
   this high quallity product.

-. ATARI CDAR 505:
   This might be the first unknown presentation on the  CeBit'91. 
   It  is a new CD-ROM which can be connected to all STE  and  TT 
   machines  and offers a memory amount of 500  MBytes.  The  CD-
   drive can also be used as an audio CD-player.
   Price: less than 1000 marks.

-. ATARI STPad:
   First of all I have to say that it is now new product but only 
   a  prototype  computer where the data entry  no  longer  takes 
   place  using  a  keyboard or a mouse but with  a  pen  writing 
   directly onto the screen in the same way you do on a piece  of 
   paper !  The pad offers the full modern ST computer power  and 
   is very  easy  to  handle.  Their are  several  advantages  of 
   entering information using the pen:

   - The  device  is independent of the type of  handwriting  and 
     also accepts Japanese characters or cyrillic ones.  

   - You can swap between writing text and drawing pictures!

   After  a particulary task the STPad switches automatically  to 
   the  standby-mode  without  requiring the  user  to  save  the 
   data.  When  returning to work with the Pad you start  at  the 
   same point and with the same picutres that you were working on 
   before. The STPad has got the same footprint as a Din A4 page, 
   is  3.5 cm high and weights about three pounds.  You can  work 
   with  this  Pad about 10 hours without recharging!

   The STPad is avaible in two versions,  with a main memory of 1 
   or of 4 MBytes.  It uses the Atari TOS and is compatible  with 
   the  ST  and  TT and all    ST programs which  use  the  Atari 
   monochrom resolution (640 x 400) will work with the Pad.
   Instead  of heavy and power-eating discdrives  the STPad  uses
   so  called  "sillicon  drive" slots.  The  slots  have  got  a 
   capacity up to 4 MByte!  Several interface "help" the STPad to 
   communicate with it's surrounding: MIDI,  RS232,  parallel and 
   DMA and an interface for an external keyboard.

-. ATARI ST NOTEBOOK FOR THE BRIEFCASE:
   This is the second new product presented by Atari on the CeBIT 
   91. This pocket-computer fits in any briefcase and has got the 
   total  amount  of  68000-ST-Power!  The 30  x  21  cm  machine 
   contains 1 MByte RAM,  20 MByte harddisc,  84/85 keys  (STE/TT 
   compatible), joypad instead of mouse and LCD screen with 640 x 
   400 pixels!  To swap data as fast as possible the  ST-Notebook 
   contains also a bus connector, RS232 and DMA.
   You  can also get some extensions which do not belong  to  the 
   basic  model e.g.:  data and/or telefax modem (allows to  send 
   data and/or telefax from any phone) and external floppy drive.

(VERY  IMPORTANT:  The STPad and the ST-Notebook have  been  pre-
sented using a prototyp-machine but they won't be sold during the 
next time!)

After  informing you about the special ATARI-products  I'll  give 
you  some facts from the financial statement of Atari  concerning 
the fourth quarter 1990 and the financial year 1990 by presenting 
you the original part of the press information:

"Statement  of the Atari Corporation for the fourth quarter  1990 
and for the financial year 1990

Hannover.  The  Atari Corporation has reported that the  turnover 
for  the fourth quarter 1990 was 151.9 million US dollars with  a 
net income of 8.8 million dollars.

The  sales  for  the financial year 1990,  which  ended  on  31st 
December,  were  411.5  million dollars.  That corresponds  to  a 
decrease of 3 percent compared to the same period in the previous 
year  (423.6 million dollars).  The net income for 1990 was  14.9 
million dollars as against 4.0 million dollars for 1989.  Due  to 
the  general weak state of the economy and consumer  concerns  in 
the light of the events in the Persian Gulf, the sales dropped by 
11  percent  in the fourth quarter of 1990 compared to  the  same 
quarter of the previous year.

During the fourth quarter of 1990,  the company made  significant 
inventory  reserves,   inluding  those  of  its  traditional  US-
manufactured video games,  in order to reflect the current market 
value.
In  addition,   the  company  repurchased  part  of  its  5  1/4% 
subordianted convertible debenture. This led to an extra-ordinary 
credit  of 14.2 million dollars (no tax effect due to the use  of 
loss carryforwards).

During 1990,  the company substantially completed the disposition 
of  the  remaining  assets and liabilities  of  its  discontinued 
operations whcih amounted to 14.6 million dollars (no tax effects 
due to the use of loss carryforwards).

Sam Tramiel, president of Atari, said: "Although our sales in the 
fourth  quarter of 1990 were  understandably  disappointing,  the 
company continues to stregthen its balance sheet.
The Atari STE and TT/030 computer line,  based on the  Motorola's 
68000  and 68030 micro-processors,  still remain the mainstay  of 
our business, and we are talking measures to ensure its continued 
growth  and  success.  The  Mega STE,  whcih  was  introduced  in 
December 1990 was well received.
This  product-along  with  the STE  and  TT,  all  with  improved 
graphics, sound and speed - stregthenend the position of Atari in 
the  market of personal computers".  And further:  "On  the  most 
recent  show  for consumer electronics,  Atari  announced  a  new 
retail  price for Lynx,  the worlds first handheld  colour  video 
game.  The new price, together with an expanded range of software 
programs, makes Lynx one of the most important competitors on the 
market for portable video games.".

This  was the original voice of the Atari president Sam  Tramiel! 
Im very sorry that I am not able to tell you anything about  this 
announced new price of the LYNX.
I hope  that  I gave you a rough idea of what has happened on the
CeBIT 91  and Atari  once again  has managed to "shock" its users
and the other firms by showing several new and well designed pro-
ducts which should  be produced and ready to sell since the Atari
fair in DÅsseldorf 1991.

Now  it is time to leave you with your own thoughts  about  Atari 
... the CeBIT and all the rest ......
