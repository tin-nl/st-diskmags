                             TURRICAN

A review by Leon O'Reilly

     Welcome to Turrican. A-ha-ha-ha!
     "A  story  of  times long ago tells us of  the  three  headed 
Morgul,  who lives in a secluded kingdom. This Morgul is the cause 
of all the fears and nightmares of mankind. It is furthermore said, 
that  in ancient times he was banished to an unknown dimension  by 
the  hero  Devolon.  Fear and sleepless  nights  disappeared  from 
people's lives.
     "For  some  time  now people have  again  been  tormented  by 
nightmares  and  suffer from a serious state of dread  and  fear. 
Hardly anybody dares to set a foot onto the streets at night and a 
dreadful fear that Morgul has returned to his kingdom is alive  in 
the people's minds again.  As the only man on earth who's  courage 
has  not yet deserted him,  you are sent off,  once again to  free 
human kind from its burden of fear.  You have been armed with  the 
latest  weapons  and technical equipment for  this  mission.  Find 
Morgul in his kingdom and destroy him for once and for all."
     i.e. this is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up.
     You  guide  your 'man' through five different  worlds  -  the 
first  three  consisting  of three levels and  the  remaining  two 
consisting of two levels. Your man is an ex-Hollywood stuntman and 
can do a variety of amazing feats simply by moving the joystick:
     Left/Right  move  him left and right,  Down  makes  him  duck 
(Quack)  and  Up  makes  him  Jump and when  I  say  Jump  I  mean 
Juuuuuummp!  He  goes so high you'd think he's on  crack.  
     Pulling Down and pressing space turns the man into a ball. In 
this mode he can't be harmed and he kills all enemies on  contact, 
but he can only move Left & Right,  he can't move up. Your man has 
three balls,  this doesn't mean he has abnormal sexual organs,  it 
means he can turn into a gyroscope only three times.
     Weapons  are  the key to this game and your man  sure  has  a 
basketfull of 'em.  There are two basic 'hand' weapons,  the laser 
and  the  multiple shot.  This is what the manual says  about  the 
multiple shot:
     "The  multiple shot can be extended in up to two  degrees  by 
collecting  the  right  symbols.   In  the  first  degree   (basic 
equipment)  the  player fires 9 horizontal shots.  In  the  second 
degree  three salvos are fired simultaneously;  3 shots in a  30-
degree  angle  upwards,  3 shots horizontal and 3 shots in  a  30-
degree  angle downwards.  The third degree resembles  the  second, 
except that the angle changes to 45 degrees."
     I  hope  that makes it clear for you.  (Who  translated  this 
manual from German? It wasn't you Sammy Joe by any chance?)
     The laser is a more powerful weapon,  it certainly does  more 
damage  when  it  hits its target,  but as it  is  only  a  single 
horizontal line it has less chance of hitting gold.  The length of 
a  line  extends  from  an  eighth to a  half  of  the  screen  by 
collecting symbols.
     Your most deadly weapon is the lightning. This is activated by 
holding  down the firebutton.  A stream of lightning  then  spurts 
from  your  weapon.   Pressing  left/right  rotate  this  beam  of 
destruction anti-clockwise/clockwise. At the start of the game the 
lightning  only extends across half the width of the  screen,  but 
again you can pick up symbols to extend its length.
     When things get hectic,  at this happens very often,  you can 
press  space  to activate two energy bars which  travel  from  you 
across  the screen destroying all enemies in  range.  Unfortunately 
these bars bars don't travel through obstacles such as walls,  and 
don't  completely destroy the tougher enemies,  merely  sap  their 
energy.  You start with three of these walls of fire,  but picking 
up symbols will grant you more.
     Another  member  of your arsenal is  the  grenade,  which  is 
cunningly disguised as a ball bearing. If you hit an enemy with it 
it has the effect of a smart bomb.  Killing all on screen enemies. 
The  manual  doesn't tell you this,  but to lob  a  grenade  press 
CAPSLOCK - Remember, you heard it in MAGGIE first!
     Mines  (And I'm not talking Arthur Scargill here) are  useful 
for destroying gun turrets and spiders that are other wise out  of 
reach. Pulling down and pressing fire activates one of these. 
     I've  talked a bit about symbols,  but how do you find  these 
little  Gems?  (And I'm not talking about Jem and  the  Holograms? 
Remember  them on WAC?  Well I didn't when I was asked a  question 
about  them in trivial pursuit - 'Who were Jem and the  Holograms' 
enemies?','How the bleeding hell should I know!' I said,  but  not 
so politely.  'The Misfits' was the answer.  Anyroad,  I still won 
beating my sister,  a student, some girl and a half drunk rabbit.) 
To collect symbols you must find blocks. (Logical, innit?). Blocks 
a hidden throughout all the levels, and to find them you must cast 
your  lightning  around  in  innocent  looking  areas.  Once  your 
lightning is in contact with a block, the block will start to glow 
and  symbols will pop out until eventually the  block  disappears. 
Then  you  simply  jump  up  and  collect  all  the   symbols. The 
collectable symbols are as follows:
Red - Activates/Extends multiple shot
Green - Activates/Extends laser
Blue - Extends lightning
Light blue - Activates force shield,  making you invincible for a 
             short time. Contact with enemies kills them.
Yellow 'P' - Recharges vitality
White 'G' - Gives you a grenade
White 'M' - Gives you a mine
White 'L' - Gives you an extra energy line
White 'X' - Makes  lots of nude  Belinda  Carlisles  appear  in 
            provocative poses.
     Other useful items not found in block are:
Diamonds - Collect three hundred of these and you'll get an  extra 
continue option. Hardly seems worth it.
Grey '1-up' triangles - The best gift a man could wish for  (Apart 
from Belinda Carlisle). These give you an extra life, and by level 
two you should have at least 20 lives.        

     Turrican is exceptionally well programmed. I must admit it is 
probably the most professionally coded game in my entire  software 
collection.  The scrolling is very smooth as you would expect from 
something that moves at fifty frames a second.  Normally  programs 
get round the STFMs scrolling difficulties in one of three ways:
a)  Reducing  the play area to half the screen or less  by  having 
exceptionally big status panels.
b) Using a large area but making it scroll so slowly two leap year 
pass in the time it takes you to advance a screen.
c) Saying 'Bugger this' and making it scroll so jerkily you need a 
pair of 2 inch thick glasses after playing one game.
     Turrican  only  has  a narrow band along the  bottom  of  the 
screen  as a status panel,  the rest of the screen is the  playing 
area,  and they've still got perfect scrolling. On level three you 
see some glorious two-level parallax scrolling.
     Sprite movement is also very good.  The 'Turrican' sprite  is 
extremely well animated,  as he jogs along his gun swing from side 
to  side.  His dying sequence isn't too impressive  though,  it's 
like he caught a bad cold and died sneezing.
     The  other sprites also move well,  although the big  baddies 
don't seem to have many frames of animation.  Even when the screen 
is full of sprites, the game doesn't appear to slow down!
     The  graphics  themselves are very  good,  from  the  loading 
screen  with lower border overscan to the game graphics with  over 
40 colours on screen.
     I  must  give a mention to the  sound,  which  is  altogether 
excellent,  from the opening sample to the in game tunes. Once the 
game  loads  you see a big Turrican logo being rained on  and  you 
also see the credits which are reflected in the  border.  Playing 
here  is  a great sampled tune which sounds  like  a  soundtracker 
tune. Some of the samples are slightly muffled but the composition 
is good.
     In  game  tunes are also good.  The first tune on  level  1-1 
isn't too good and keeps getting interrupted by your gunfire,  but 
those on later levels are good with some great drum sounds, though 
surprisingly level 4 appears to have no music. I was not surprised 
to find out that their creator was none other than Maestro of  the 
YM2149F,  Jochen  Hippel.
     The popular computer press criticised this game for being too 
hard,  too fast and too complex! Lamers! They've probably tried to 
complete the game using just three lives!
       This  game  is truly excellent,  it brings  a  totally  new 
definition to the word shoot-em-up. It a lot more interesting than 
Xenon 2, it makes you laugh in hysterics at the scrolling in Blood 
Money that Wayne J. Smithson said "Pushed the ST to its limits".
With 13 levels and 1300 screens,  this game is huge and there  are 
plenty  of  hidden extras.  It is a  challenge,  though  it  isn't 
impossible.  I  got to level 4-2 on the fourth day of having  it, 
though advancing past here isn't easy.
     Its  a shame Rainbow Arts haven't released more ST  games  in 
this country,  there programmers are infinitely more talented than 
the bumbling idiots at Ocean and US Gold. Sammy Joe would probably 
say its just the Germans natural talent.
     Graphics  and sound are excellent as is scrolling and  sprite 
movement.  Everything is so smooth you begin to think you have  an 
Atari Lynx with all its custom chips not just a humble STFM. These 
guys  should have converted Shadow of the Beast to  the  ST,  they 
would have probably made it better than the Amiga version!
     If  you haven't got this game,  buy it now.  If  shoot-em-ups 
don't appeal to you,  try it out in your local computer shop  then 
buy it! Just wonderful!

Other software houses take note, this is how a game should be programmed!
The sequel promises to be even better - is that possible?
