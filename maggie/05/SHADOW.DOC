Well, this is getting on a bit now and I was suprised no one else 
had reviewed it.  The basic idea of this game is Beat 'Em  Up.  I 
can't  remember exactly what it is about as I have not played  it 
for  ages  but  you are a ninja bloke who has  to  fight  through 
hoards  of baddies to get to the end (suprise suprise) where  the 
Big Baddie is waiting for you. 
The first thing which hits you about this game is grafixxxx. They 
are  very  good indeed and animated very  well.  When  you  start 
playing the game though you suddenly get a shock,  the  scrolling 
is  awfull!  as  you get to one side of the  screen  the  picture 
suddenly  jumps  across  which,  to begin  with,  can  leave  you 
wondering  where  you are.  This and the sound are  probably  the 
worst  parts of the game.  Its not the muzix thats actually  bad, 
it's  when  you  turn  to the sound  FX.  I  think  that  sampled 
"whacks!"  and  "Arrgghh!!"s would have definately  improved  the 
game. 
Then there's gameplay.  If you had a test play of this game in  a 
shop you  would probably want to buy it straight  away.  This  is 
mainly  because of the grafixxxx and the number of well  animated 
moves you can do,  Things like a pheonix backflip (eh?) and  some 
strange  and amazing throws.  Once you've played the game  a  bit 
more though, you find it hasn't much more to offer. After about a 
week (or less) it becomes very boring to play. It's also not that 
hard either. I think I finished it in about a fortnight. Once you 
have  finished the game there is really  nothing  left,  gameplay 
wise and the disks seem to slowly fade to the back of  your  disk 
box, to be found about ten years later when you say "I never knew 
I had that" and start playing it all over again......

I'm  not sure whether I like this or Double Dragon 2  better  coz 
I've  only played DD2 about twice.  Shadow Warriors is  certainly 
better than DD1 though (not much of a guide line but who cares..)
