Theme : Music on the 16 bits (Atari ST Mainly!)

Well, I think it is safe to say that everyone who will end up reading 
this is quite familiar with at least one of the following:

Mad Max (Jochen Hippel)
Rob Hubbard
Count Zero
David Whitaker
Soundtracker/Noisetracker
Quartet

Music is one of the most expanding aspects of the computer world, and I 
don't doubt that by the time you do read this, there will be a new and 
better product just released.  I will attempt to review some areas of 
the music industry which are currently available.

I will start with the most interesting subject to me, which is 
Soundchip Music (Synthesised).  This type of music has been the most 
common on the Atari ST up to know, and has varied hugely depending on 
the composer and the time which it was written.  Tunes from the older 8 
bit machines have been converted to the ST and the Amiga so that the 
fantastic tunes would not vanish, but would continue to give atmosphere 
to games and demo's.
Each computer has it's own capabilities for producing soundchip sound 
and the ST was not blessed with the built in waveforms and volume 
control that other computers offered.  This however is not the end of 
the story.  The beauty of having control over the frequencies and other 
elements of a sound with the power of the computer is that the 
programmer can create his/her sound.  It has to be said that Mad Max 
has been the front runner of this type of creation and the results are 
amazing.

If you are to take control of a tone to make your own unique sound, or 
to create a sound that most suits the tune you are writing, you have the 
power to do it with a soundchip.  It all depends on how far you want to 
go! If you start sending kilobytes of information to a soundchip you 
will be able to create lifelike sounds of real instruments.  This is 
normally done with the aid of a sampler, which captures the information 
you need, then all you need to do is thrust it back at the soundchip to 
emulate that sound.  As this needs so much data being pumped very fast 
it is not easily manipulated and takes up most or all of the processors 
time.  So what you have left is to just send small changes to the sound 
every now and again (Every now and again could mean 200 times a second 
to a processor) and let the soundchip create a audible tone to those 
changes.  Sometimes these changes are automatically done by the 
soundchip and hence the built in waveforms on computers like the C64.  
The standard ST soundchip (YM2149) is not capable of creating waveforms 
like frequency modulation on it's own, so you have to do it.  
Unfortunately (Correct me Jochen if I am wrong!), other elements like 
volume control cannot be altered to give more settings than the 
standard set, so this a drawback.

So after all that, you are left with a fast and efficient way of 
producing tunes on your computer.  But are you satisfied?  Some people 
(Commonly an Amiga owner) will say "what's that tinny/tinkely sound" 
after hearing his/her 4 channel guitar sample.  If it's a typical Mad 
Max or Count Zero soundtrack you could turn round and say "Oh! that's 
just a virtual 5 channel piece of music with frequency modulation, a 
unique snare and bass drum sound, and a fantastic tune which someone 
took a great deal of time composing and researching.  How's your 10 
second sample which was taken from a common instrument?"

My conclusion is this: Soundchip sound is not necessarily limited to the 
built in capabilities of the soundchip, but you have to work to produce 
sounds which are not defaultly available.  Very little processor time is 
needed and you can create not just a tune, but the sounds as well!

The types of programs that are available for this type of sound are 
Music Studio and Music Construction Set which do not offer much more 
than the soundchip can.  There is currently a program which will let you 
use the BAT cartridge (MV16) to it's potential, but I have not seen 
this.  I also have not seen one for the STE's soundchip but I have 
started to write one!


I will move on now to the world of Sampled Music which is currently 
expanding so fast that I will probably be out of date.

It has to be said that the Amiga has been in the past the main computer 
to use samples of instruments in tunes for general use.  Sampled sound 
just means that the sound is taken from the outside world and is 
converted into data for the computer to store.  This data is used to 
produce a sound which is extremely near to the real sound.  This method 
works by constantly monitoring the sound as it is played with the use of 
a sampler.  Each time the sound is monitored, a part of it's frequencies 
are converted into numbers.  These frequencies are the key to the 
quality of a sample.  If a sample is taken at 10 khz then you can be 
sure of capturing most of the sound's frequencies from 1hz to 5khz (Half 
of the sample speed).  The human ear can distinguish between sounds up 
to about 22 khz, so to capture a sound to it's full quality you have to 
sample at 44 khz (eg. a CD holds samples at 44.1 khz).  The number's 
which are received through the sampler can range in BIT's, the more 
BIT's the better the quality again.  The ST and Amiga typically sample 
at 8 BIT's and I think CD's are at 32 Bit's.

Samples have three major disadvantages:

They take up huge amounts of memory proportional to the quality (The 
higher the quality, the more memory!).

They need fast processors to feed back the data through the computer to 
reproduce the sound.

They are not easily manipulated.


The Amiga has the ability to leave all the processing to a custom chip 
so that it is free to do other things Amiga's do (eg. play a game, or 
demo, or play a game).  It still has the two other restrictions though.
Also because the Amiga cannot hope to play sounds at 44 khz and at 32 
bits it has a filter.  The filter is there to dull out the impurities in 
the sound, left by the low quality sample.

The ST has not seen much of the 4 channel soundtracker type music that 
the Amiga has, in the past, because of it's lack of the custom chip that 
the Amiga has.  THIS IS NOW VERY MUCH DIFFERENT!

With the skill of people like An Cool the time in which it takes the ST 
to produce samples has decreased dramatically and now has taken a big 
role on the ST.  With quality products like TCB Soundtracker, 
Noisetracker, Quartet and various other soundtrackers, the ST looks like 
it now has the option to use such music.  Obviously the STE will have 
the more power in all aspects of the sound produced on an Atari over the 
STfm.

Another way of helping the ST to produce better sampled sound is to get 
a cartridge.  These are the ones which I know of:

ST Replay, ProSound, MV16, Playback, MPH Cartridge.

Unfortunately these are not compatible with each other, so each 
program has to have replay routines for all of the above to appeal to 
all owners.

My Conclusion: Sampled music usually appeals to more people than 
Soundchip music because of it's familiar sounds and it's ease of use if 
you have a tracker program.  It uses huge amounts of memory and can use 
lots of processor time.  Because of the memory restrictions you can 
easily get bored of a tune because of the lack of different instruments.  
There are quite a few cartridge's around and it's starting to get like a 
PC market (Next we will be saying "Got this great game, it's Replay and 
ProSound compatible", "Shame I've got the MPH Cartridge").  You could of 
course buy them all!


Personally I like the Mad Max approach to the Soundchip/Sample dilemma, 
and have at least one channel being samples while the other two are new 
created soundchip waveforms.

Well this seem's to be the end of this article so I will finish by 
saying that all this information is just what I have learned through 
experience but some of it could be wrong, so if you know of anything 
else that I could use for my Soundchip program for the STE, or want to 
correct me on something then please contact me.

Hi (Greets) to Mungo, The Maggie Team, Warlock, Frozen Ghost, and 
definitely to Mad Max and Count Zero.
