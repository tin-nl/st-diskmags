     As  soon  as you start,  walk right without  hesitating  thus 
avoiding all the laser blasts.  On the next screen,  wait for  the 
robot to descend the ladder,  then shoot him. Walk to the right of 
the  screen and plant a detonator by the block.  Walk  away,  then 
walk right through the hole you've just created.  Collect all  the 
goodies in this room,  then walk left back where you've came from. 
Climb up the ladder without pausing.
     Being  careful to avoid the sparks from the orbs  above  you, 
climb the next ladder and crawl left and press the  button.  Crawl 
right onto the next screen
     Shoot  the two robots that come towards you.  Walk right  and 
climb  the  ladder and press the button.  Walk  left  onto  rising 
platform and lie down.  When it reaches the top, crawl right under 
the  laser bolts.  Jump onto the tins and collect the extra  ammo. 
Climb ladder into little room and press the left button,  not  the 
one which the arrow points to.  Go back down,  jump onto  platform 
and shoot robot.  Jump left and climb pipe,  then move right. Wait 
for robot to drop, then shoot him. Blow block you are standing by, 
then slide a detonator down the tunnel. Go through tunnel, collect 
all the goodies then go back out. 
     Jump  onto left pipe,  climb up,  press button and  run  onto 
platform.  When platform rises to next level,  crawl right setting 
off  laser and killing robot.  Crawl right to ladder and in  break 
between laser blasts, climb down ladder, collect goodies and shoot 
robot.  Jump left and press button again.  Get back onto platform, 
go back up.  Climb pipe on left of screen.  Walk right, jump right 
and shoot robot. Jump up and press button. Time jump between laser 
blasts, then jump all the way up to the platform. Press button and 
turn left.  When platform reaches the middle of the  screen,  jump 
left.  Walk left then slide a detonator down onto the robot below. 
Walk left.
     Fall down the hole and shoot the robot.  Walk left and  press 
the  button  to switch off the laser.  Walk right  and  press  the 
button to raise the platform. When it gets to the top, jump right. 
This  next bit is tricky.  Wait for the spark to leave  the  right 
gun,  then  jump left.  Walk a few steps then jump again over  the 
oncoming spark.  Another jump should take you down the hole.  Turn 
right  and shoot the robot.  Walk right,  left and fall  down  the 
hole.  Crawl right and collect the ammo.  Crawl left and jump  up. 
Walk  left  and when the platform rises,  walk onto it  and  press 
button  to turn off the laser.  Go down on the platform  and  walk 
left off it. Crawl right until you fall onto some tins. When robot 
is at the the other side of the screen,  crawl off tins and  shoot 
him. Crawl left and collect detonators. Crawl right and get on top 
of  ladder.  Avoid spark and fall right.  Walk towards  middle  of 
screen just out of walking tins reach. When tin reaches the middle 
of the screen, follow him left then climb down part of the ladder. 
When  robot reaches left of the screen,  climb down and right  and 
shoot him. Blow up block on left of screen and walk left.
     When  platform is above you,  jump up and let it take you  to 
the  left of the screen.  Jump left so you land beside the  block. 
Wait for the platform that moves the furthest to come near to you, 
plant  detonator and fall onto platform which will take  you  away 
from explosion.
     Alternatively,  fall off onto platform that hardly moves  and 
jump  onto  ladder to avoid explosion,  then fall  back  onto  the 
platform.  Jump back through passage that has new opened.  Collect 
all the goodies.  Come back out of the passage and walk onto  long 
moving  platform.  Once it gets under the ladder,  jump  up.  When 
robot  walks  past you,  climb up and blast him.  Walk  left  onto 
rising platform and press button at top. Crawl right and jump onto 
platform.  jump off platform,  but not too far as there is a leaky 
pipe.  Let  robot walk into this,  then crawl under it  and  climb 
ladder.   Collect  detonators  and  climb  other   ladder.   Plant 
detonator,  climb  down to avoid  explosion.  Crawl  right,  plant 
another  detonator  and jump up onto platform.  When  it  explodes 
press  red  button  to let platform fall  away.  Walk  right  onto 
platform.  Walk left under 4th laser, when 3rd goes off walk left. 
Climb  pipe and shoot robot at top.  Jump over walking tin  as  it 
comes towards you.  Jump onto pile of tins,  jump across platforms 
to  button  on left side of the screen and  press  it.  Walk  onto 
rising platform.  Crawl left under leaky pipe.  Climb ladder, walk 
right onto platform.  As walking tin goes towards left of  screen, 
walk right off platform then crawl right off the edge. Walk right. 
Shoot  three  robots and jump up onto the platform  then  jump  up 
again. Lie down and crawl left collecting goodies. Crawl left onto 
platform and let it fall.  Step off it and walk right.  Climb  up 
ladder and press button to activate laser and shoot robot. Jump up 
and  climb ladder.  Jump up onto next ladder,  climb up  and  walk 
right.  Wait for robot to come down and shoot him.  Blow up  block 
and crawl through.  Fall down onto extra ammo. Jump left and climb 
up then up again and walk onto rising platform.  Press button  and 
lie down as platform goes up again. Crawl right, fall down and get 
goodies.  In gap in laser shots,  jump right and crouch down. Then 
climb ladder.  Walk left and jump onto tin. As soon as electricity 
goes off,  jump and walk right.  Climb ladder. Crawl right and get 
goodies. Jump onto platform and crouch down. In gap in the lasers, 
jump onto ladder.  Climb it,  wait for robot to climb down  ladder 
and shoot him.  Press button and walk onto platform. Climb ladder. 
Wait  for  laser to get two robots.  Walk onto platform  at  left. 
Press first button, when platform rises, press next button to turn 
off laser.  Then walk right,  jump up and shoot robot. Jump up and 
up.  Don't press the button on right unless there is a robot  left 
to kill, in which  case press it and duck  down. Climb left ladder
and walk right....you've completed level 1!
