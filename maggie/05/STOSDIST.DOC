        Welcome to this little bit of stuff by me steve
        i will in this section try to explain how distortion
        can be achieved using stos basic. If you look at the
        program it is really very simple to achieve good fx
        the mian loop of the program consists of def scrolls
        these can be found at lines 130-200 ,i.e
 
        130 def scroll1,60,190-y to 250,199-y,1,0
        
        If we look at this line we see that scroll zone 1
        is shifted 1 step(16 pixels) to the right
        and we have y as a variable. 
        This is increased using inc y ,This causes a block
        of 9 pixels high to move up the screen ,This can
        also be decreased to make the block go down.
       
        Next we look at how the six or more scroll zones
        work together to give the desired effect.
        Scroll 1 goes right 1 step
        Scroll 2 goes left 2 steps
        Scroll 3 goes right 3 steps
        Scroll 4 goes left 2 steps 
        Scroll 5 goes right 1 step
        Scroll 6 goes left 1 step
       
        All this brings the screen back to were it started
        but you could leave the screen to the left or the right

        Lines 220-270 check position of the scrolls up the  screen  
        and send the prg to the sub routines for starting the 
        following scrolls on there way .i.e. When scroll area 1
        moves up the screen 16 pixels scroll 2 is then set on
        its way at line 290 as below
 
        290 scroll 2
        300 if e>0 then inc a
        302 if a>130 then dec a
        305 if e=0 then a=0
        310 return

        If we look at line 300 this checks to see if e is not 0
        if eis not 0 then a is increased this moves scroll 2 
        up the screen
        Line 302 checks to see that a is less than 130 which is
        the top of the area to be distorted.If it is greater then
        a is decreased this is done to stop the scroll going
        above the area to be distorted
        Line 305 checks to see if e is 0 ,e is set at 1 to start 
        with and corresponds to scroll 6 the last scroll,When
        e reaches130 then it is set to 0 this inturn set all
        the variables to 0 ready to reapeat all over again
        then e is set to 1 agian .



        This is basically how it works i have left all the rems in 
        the basic source to help you more,You can ignore the intro
        screen and exit screens as they are there just for show


        O.K. if you have any hints tricks or tips for use in stos
        then send them to me and i will send you some more of my
        stuff ,some of it is new some older than this routine
