
TURBO PASCAL PROGRAMMING FOR BEGINNERS:

If you are a profesional turbo pascal programmer,don't bother
to read this! However, if you are a novice,this may be useful
to you.It's not difficult to program in pascal once you get to
know a little more about it, especially the commands and their
functions.
There are different versions of turbo pascal,I'm not sure if
all the commands of version 2.00 (the one I've got) will work 
on all other versions aswell.But now,to the programming:


At the beginning of every program you have give your program a
name.

e.g.: Program mathematics;     or:   Program whatever;

The name of the prog. has to be one word only!(And don't forget
the semicolon!!)
 
As pascal is most suitable for maths ,physics or even chemistry,
I will later on show you a short and really easy prog to begin
with.

The second step is to define the variables you are going to use
and whether they are real or integer.

e.g.: VAR  a,b,c : real;     or:  VAR  a,b,c : integer;

If you have chosen integer variables, you can't later on type in 
numbers like 1.67483 or - 6 ... .
(Again, don't forget to put the semicolon after each line! Only 
on a few occasions you leave it out.)

Now you type " begin " and you can start with the main program.


For example,you want to create a maths prog with sums.
Have a look at this:

Program sum;
VAR A,B,C : real;

Begin
writeln(' *** SUM *** ');
writeln;
writeln(' Type in a number for A: ');   
read(A);                                
writeln(' Type in a number for B: ');
read(B);
C:= A+B;
writeln;
writeln(' ******  RESULTS  ****** ');
writeln;
writeln(' C = ',C:6:2);
end.


" writeln" means the same thing as "print".That what's in the in-
verted commas is printed on the screen.(Easy,huh?)
"read" means ... you know what. It reads the number you have chosen.
The thing at the end "writeln(' C=',C:6:2);" means that the result
of the sum can be as high as 6 numbers before the comma and two be-
hind.The "2" is only used for real numbers.Anyhow,it doesn't really
matter.(The result in this example cannot be higher than 999999.99).

Note that if you type" writeln; " only you leave a space between
the lines .

At the end of each program you always have to put the three letter
word "end." at the end,not forgetting the little black dot.

Another little prog:

Program Guess;
Var a : integer;

Begin
writeln(' Can you guess my number? ');
writeln;
writeln(' What do you think my number is? (Between 1 and 50!)');
read(a);
If a=45 then
writeln(' You have guessed it !!!');
If a<45 then
writeln(' You are a loser ');
If a>45 then
writeln(' You are a loser ');
end.


This should be easy to understand.This prog allows you to enter
a number between 1 and 50 .If the number you have chosen
is wrong, the computer prints " You are a loser " otherwise
the words " You have guessed it !!! " appears on the screen.

*******************************************************************

If you have got a problem (maybe in physics) to solve ,
eg.: A car travels at 50 mph .The road is 5 miles. How long does
     it take?

     In this example you need three variables. V for velocity,
     t for time and l for the length of the road.

     THE PROGRAM LOOKS LIKE THIS:
     
     Program physics;
     Var v,t,l : real;

     Begin
     writeln('  ********  PHYSICS  ******** ');
     writeln;
     writeln('  Speed of the car: ');
     read(v);
     writeln;
     writeln('  How long is the road? ');
     read(t);
     t:=l/v;
     writeln('  The car travels for ',t:6:2'seconds');
     end.


IF YOU NEED TO HAVE A SQUAREROOT OF A NUMBER SIMPLY WRITE:
 
     A:= SQRT(B+C);

Try to write a program like this, just with different variables
and terms.

e.g: You want to know the volume of a cube or a tennisball...
     Write a prog, that when it's finished you just type in
     the sides of a cube or the radius of your tennisball and
     the computer tells you its volume!

I guess that's about it for this time I think!
