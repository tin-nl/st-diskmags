Okay, I expect you're wondering at this moment something like 
"Cor blimey Guv, who are all these green turtles when they're at 
home then?" Well, we are probably the least famous demo crew in 
the whole universe. At the moment we have only released one demo 
but another is in the pipe lines (what a stupid saying) which 
should be out when you read this. Oh by the way, if you really 
have never heard of us before (I've done some articles for this 
mag before), are full name is The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
  Enough of this chit chat (another strange saying), on with

  WELLLLLLLL THATS ALL FROM RAPHAEL SO I SHALL SEE YOU QUIRES

WANTED ME TO SAY THAT!!!!!!

What? This is Don again by the way. You may be suprised by this 
but Raphael has lived in England all his life. However, if you 
care to observe his first paragraph, you will notice that there 
are no full stops. Through out the rest of his interview you will 
also notice numourous spelling mistakes. I thought I'd say this 
coz you may have thought he was french bloke who didn't know any 
English or something but he is, definately, English. 

Anyway, before Raph left, I was telling him about Madonnas new 
video. He didn't see it which was unfortunate, but I did. All I 
would like to say, if you haven't seen it already, is it is about 
as implicit as page 3. I do, however, have no complaints (hehe) 
about it and would reckomend you see it. It's not that bad 
really, I suppose, compared with some of the porno films I've 
seen, but for a song video it certainly beats the rest. I don't 
think there is one point when you actually see some tits, but you 
can see them through the various skimpy underwear worn.  It think 
mike saw this video, so you'll have to see his reaction. Speaking 
of which, Michaelangelo is the next (and last) person in this 
amazingly interesting inertview thing. Over to you Mike!!!

your habit of pinching all the boys willys that you keep telling

attempts to ask me something

FAVE JOKE :it's not my best but one that springs to mind
           'What happened to the irishman that put a condom on

           'He went!'

P.S : I had a mental headache when I was writing this

Yes it's now Donatello back here to save you from that completely 
crazy person, Michaelangelo! It's funny though, Mikey told me 
that what he wrote down for his WORST THOUGHT was actually his 
BEST THOUGHT. Fightening isn't it? Enough of this slagging now on 
with the article!
Ermm.... Well that seems to be about it really.  I have been 
trying to get Michaelangelo to finish this article for ages. I 
originally started it about a month ago. The day I did this Raph 
came round and wrote his part. Then I forgot about it! When I 
remembered (about 4 days ago!) I gave it straight to Mike. He 
kept forgeting to write the thing as well! In the last issue of 
Maggie Sammy Joe said something about a Christmas Maggie. The 
date is now 31st of December. Hope we're not to late, the other 
articles by me have been ready for about a week but I had to wait 
for Mike to finish this before I could send them off. 
And now, the end is near, etc etc.

Oh yeah, after I had written my bit at the beginning of this 
article I recieved the OVERDRIVE DEMO by PHALANX. I think this is 
pretty amazing demo (although I don't like the muzix much) and 
would would put it up with the Cuddly's and Mindbomb for my Fave 
demos.

And now I think I'll leave you with a joke.
