HELLO       TO      EVERYBODY      WHO      HATES       COMPUTERS 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Here's a little poem concerning the Poll Tax which does not exist 
any more, but still it is quite funny !
Here we go....

     The Alternative to the Poll Tax. 

The country was in a terrible state,
Parliament was having a budget debate,
It was quite a few moments before Thatcher spoke,
Then she said, "Sex will cost two quid a poke,
Whether you're short, skinny, long or thick,
The tax will be paid on the use of your prick."
Then Tony Benn said to Maggie,"Look here,
Will the tax apply to the boys who are queer?"
Ex-chancellor Lawson rose and looked glum,
"Will I be exempt as I only like bum?"
Maggie replied, and shouted quite airy,
"You'll fucking pay double, you dirty old fairy !"
Up rose David Steel to tremendous applause,
He grabbed hold of Shirley and whipped off her drawers,
He straddled across her and fucked her at will,
And shouted at Maggie,"Put that on your bill !"
Hattersly then shouted,"I think I'll resign,
I haven't had sex for such a long time.
I dream every night of a big juicy crutch,
But two quid a time is a bit fucking much !"
The debate carried on, oh what a sight,
Kinnock kept wanking the whole of the night,
M.P.'s were coming - the speaker was last,
And in the excitement the dumb bill was passed.
So now in the bedrooms of England each night,
There's many a fanny closed good and tight.
They're taxing our booze and taxing our fags,
And now the bastards are taxing our shags.
If two quid a time is the price we must pay,
It's now with ourselves that we must play.
So to quench our frustration we go for a wank,
For the state of the country we have Thatcher to thank.


Here  are some German lyrics whivh deals with Anti-Turks  lyrics, 
the  views expressed in this DO NOT express the views of  any  of 
the Maggie Team. 

Eine Tuerke steht im Walde 
Ganz still und stumm
Da kommt ein deutscher Panzer
und faehrt ihn um
Dank der deutschen Bundeswehr 
gibt es kein Tuerken mehr.

                    The END


Coitus interruptus! (MFP #6)

Delta Force are back!! And again Slime and New Mode are nerving!
After a sleepless night (we have to bear a girl named Regine,  16 
years old - because of the fear that Sammy Joe wants to bump  her 
and  to vomit over her cunt she came to us and laid down  in  New 
Mode's bed and nervs all the night long!) we are woken up at 6 am.
because  of a nasty lamer called Schnulz (GCF-a former member  of 
us  - what a lamer urrgh!),  but we beat this asshole  to  death! 
Another  very big lamer sleeps in the living-room and his  really 
unnecessary   name   is  (was)   Nico   Spaghettio   Satzikolakis 
Malagerikos  etc  etc.  I will now stop writing cause I  want  to 
knock out this still vomitting Sammy Joe.... Let's wrazzzzzzzzzzzz!

New Mode says:

DELTA FORCE - TLB     1:0
(Sammy Joe - You're a real loser!)

The Revenge of the Ninja Waver Sammy Joe Juniors:
--------------------------------------------------
After  a  heavy  drinking session with  Delta  Force  playing  an 
excellent  game called Quartern I managed to persuade Slime  (the 
bloody oozing son of a whore)  to stay for the night. Ah well, my 
hang-over is severe and therefore the stupid key click gets on my 
nerves and therefore again I am going to stop !!!  And NOT  vomit 
like other people like Slime or Steffen (SJ is a liar!).



The Return of GCF
-----------------

The unforgettable German Cracking Force are back.  Watch out  for 
the  latest and best Software that money can buy like  NAM,Silent 
Service II,A-10 Tank Killer etc. For more informations write to

That`s it.

Sammy  Joe just arrived from shaving his  dick!    dxfkm4trg  aw2 
5r7y (Sorry just beating SJ's head on the keyboard!) It's a  ugly 
mess of blood now at the keys!)

The GCF wants to buy a tv!!!

Sammy  Joe  just eats a bread that looks like as he  had  vomited 
over it (is mir schlecht!)
If any censors will occur then there will be a revenge of DF.

Reagge:
ˇˇˇˇˇˇˇ
I`ve  just  slept  a  little because  of  nerving  Jochen.He`s  a 
"Schwaetzer".I`m  now a mascot and have to be a slave for Slime  and 
Steffen.Sammy Joe tried to beat me up with chainsaw, whips and 
chains.I`m  now ending because of this drunken horrible  guys  of 
Delta Force.......

WHEEEEEE!!!! You can tell I'm shit outta ideas, can't you!!!

I've just been moving the title or 'masthead' bit a few spaces  to 
the  right  whilst  the  brain  starts  working  again.   This  is 
impossible  of course,  as the brain has long since been dissolved 
by drink!!

This  is the hidden article you are reading,  congratulations  for 
getting  this  far,  if so,  you will probably be A) German,  B) A 
member  of  the  Union,  C)  Fluent in  both  English  and  German 
languages, or D) Extremely lucky, the Hidden Article Quest is like 
the Lamertest (TM) with balls (Testicles, not 3-D bitmaps) and you 
have to be brilliant (or cheat like buggery..) to get through..

This  issue of MAGGIE has contributions for the hidden article  by 
most  of the regular writers,  normal service will resume  shortly 
(Whatever passes for normal around here, I've forgotten myself...) 
But  in the meantime,  here's some freefall wibble to be going  on

megademo, which was               A  Assembly's AUDIO SCULPTURE
'pencilled in' for                   soundtracker, it will be 
around Xmas time last             A  available from MPH who do

appeared and it seems             A  at the end of April (so 
to this writer that                  they tell me..) and will
they are keeping their            A  probably be the most 
promise of no more new               fully-featured soundtracker
demos.. It is also very           A  on the ST to date....
strange that they have               (so they tell me.....)
several new members and           A  expect a full review in here

                WELL  THAT WAS A VERY HARD BASTARD  OF  A  LANDING                   
                WASN'T IT

  LET US LIE HERE AWHILE,  AS I THINK THIS IS A BIT PAINFUL TO SAY 
  THE LEAST, FOR A START, MY LEFT LEG IS MISSING....

  >no it isn't mate, it's over there ---->LEFT LEG
 
  THANK  YOU,  YOU  ARE VERY KIND FOR SOMEONE WITH NO  UPPER  CASE 
  LETTERS TO HIS NAME.....

  >that's ok pal, anytime.......

  ANYWAY, WHERE WAS I, OH YEAH!!!!
                                  A
                                  A

                                (ETC..)

  Now drawing a veil over this sad attempt to be clever  and  fill 
space, I understand that the other function of the Hidden Article 
in  Maggie  is for some of the TOO CONTROVERSIAL TO  PUT  ANYWHERE 
ELSE articles, such as...

  STORY:-  "One day,  Nobby and the Emperor Caligula,  and his pet 
horse, got together in the leafy glade for some really heavy sado-
masochistic rituals involving birch twigs,  tinned peaches,  and a 
combine harvester. Firstly, they xxxxxxxxxxxx CENSORED xxxxxxxx
  xxxxxxx do it roughly,  he cried..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx spreading  the 
custard evenly xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Remember AN COOL!!  he cried 
at  the height of his xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Thank  you!  whinnied 
the horse.. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Finally,  you  can  use  the hidden article to  express  your  own 
personal views and tastes (See above....) and bad taste jokes,

  Such as:- 'There were these two Amiga owners walking  along  the 
   beach  when  they chance across this  drowned  corpse...  "It's 
    Partytime!!"  they  cry,  and xxxxxxxxxxx with the help  of  a 
    tumble-dryer, they xxxxxxxxxxx from behind.... Sometime later, 
      they  depart with a shaky grin on their faces..  The  corpse 
       turns to his mate and says.....

        "It's  bad enough doing it with hedgehogs and  sheep,  but 
       Amiga owners are positively the pits my dear!!!!
     (and you can still get five years for it probably....)
    (.....Any resemblance to a TCB joke is purely deliberate)

Anyway,  I  think  this should keep Mike quiet,  so I now hand you 
back  to the rest of the hidden article,  THANK YOUUU FOR  READING 
THIS !!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUwwwwwwwwaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!

not  done sooner,  but trust you can get on with enjoying the rest

Killing an Arab is cool
'specially when this one's a fool
They call him Saddam Hussein
But really he's a fucking pain.

Kick arse, kick arse, kick arse
but whatever you do, do it fast ! x2

Jump straight into barbed wire
Ripped to pieces by machine gun fire
Destruction all around
Salvation, a grave in the ground.

Kick arse, kick arse, kick arse
but whatever you do, do it fast ! x2

Flying high above the flak
Going in for the attack
Pilots getting trapped
Their planes being scrapped.

Kick arse, kick arse, kick arse
but whatever you do, do it fast ! x2

Saddam, what is you aim
How many lives will you claim
What's this war all coming to
Soon it'll be you too

Kick arse, kick arse, kick arse
but whatever you do, do it fast ! x2

Saddam, we'll bring you to your knees !
(vicious laugh)


This was all now for the hidden article in this Issue, I think that 
this one is probably the best of all so far, so, see ya next time 
for another hidden article.
