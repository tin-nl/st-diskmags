
           THE TVI-PARTYDEMO CALLED 'HACKABONDS'!!!!!
           ------------------------------------------

Again another partydemo to write about,  but I'm nearly  sleeping 
so I'll just mention the most important facts.  This demo  should 
have been launched about october but caused by some great  errors 
within  the  loader TVI presented their product about one  and  a 
half months later! 

Let's  start  with the intro!  You see  a  fullscreen  containing 
hardscrolling,  a  great four channel digisound and  some  little 
scrolllines!  Very well done!  After this you can enter the  main 
menu which reminds us off the Sowatt-menu,  although we must  say 
that they add the digisound(!!!!)!
Eigth  screens  can be activated but I only want  to  inform  you 
about the screens which are worth pressing the keyboard to  start 
them.

1.  The Respectables bring their first screen,  which depends  on 
some  very  well done rasters and some small  but  nice  grafixx. 
colourful!!11

2.  The  next  screen  by  TVI contains  the  very  famous  ball-
scrollline and some further grafixx as stars and a distorter! Not 
bad for a party-demo!

3.  Last but surely not least you get a screen coded by Oxygen of 
the  Lost Boys.  His screen presents a lot of small  scrolllines, 
two  big  smilies,  a rasterscroller and  a  fantastic  digisound 
modul!

That's it! After all I think it's an average partydemo containing 
some very well screens,  but also a screen I don't want remember. 
Nothing more it's time to leave you ..........
