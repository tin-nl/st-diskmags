                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This  is the first in an occasional series of  'Lifestyle  Guides' 
which deals with important topics,  such as the one above,, Coming 
soon,  my  all-important guide to 'University & College Life'  and 
others which I've yet to think of........

Getting drunk is an extremely important job, and cannot be left to 
amateurs  and Lamers,  although anyone can and does get  pissed... 
Firstly, you have got to consider the materials to do the job...

NOT A LOT OF USE:- Water, tea, coffee, raw sewage, fruit juice, as 
all  of  these are alchohol-free,  you will tend to  explode  from 
over-consumption rather than intoxicate yourself...

STILL  NOT  GETTING THERE:- Bread,  granite,  wallpaper,  sweet and 
sour  chicken  (fried  rice),  these are all SOLID as  opposed  to 
liquid,  with  zero  alchohol,  and  some of these items  are  not 
exactly edible either....

STARTING  TO  GO  PLACES  (just..):-  Low-alchohol  lager,  sherry 
trifle,  Lemonade  &  beer shandy,  wine gums (?)...  These are for 
lamer consumption,  a lot of lamers have been seen puking-up after 
a pound of wine-gums, it is widely believed that you can also hear 
strange  voices  but that this is due to the  chemicals  used  for 
flavour enhancement and colouring....

LAMER'S  DEFINITION  OF A GOOD ALCHOHOLIC DRINK:-  Most  processed 
gassy  bog-standard  pub and night-club  lager,  BUDWEISER,  which 
comes  in just above water,  I bet he drinks CARLING BLACK  LABEL, 
etc, other culprits include CASTELMAINE XXXX, and FOSTERS... These 
lame pints are a particular British problem, often taking the name 
of   their   illustrious   continental   counterparts   (Heineken, 
Carlsberg..)  and not a lot else,  I'm afraid that most lager is a 
disappointment here, being artificially produced...

Also,  most  beer  (bitter,  mild)  is  controlled by  a  few  big 
companies,  the  same people who produce the lager and is  nothing 
special  either..  People who enjoy this,  and the cheap and nasty 
lager  are  the  kind of people who enjoy  KAROAKE  NIGHTS  (Gak!! 
Vomit!!) and whip out their bottoms to expose to passing  traffic, 
and wear white ankle-length sports socks..

Having  revealed what an appalling snob I am,  here are some other 
lame ways to get pissed...

  (See page 2....)



OTHER  LAME WAYS TO GET PISSED:- Granny's bottle of sweet  sherry, 
(especially if it has her false teeth in it..),  that really cheap 
and nasty bottle of off-licence wine which is too sweet for  human 
consumption,   various   horrid  paintstripper  liquors  such   as 
supermarket own-brand whisky,  paint-remover,  meths,  antifreeze, 
drinking  all  of  the  above whilst  at  a  Karaoke  'Sing-along' 
evening..

SOME BETTER WAYS TO GET PISSED:- This article,  more than most, is 
down  to  personal tastes,  and I like nothing better than a  Good 
Pint  of 'Old Ridleys 1084 strength bottom-burner' (or  its  local 
equivalent) as when I can get it,  I am keen on the Brews produced 
by smaller independant brewers (Alright, real ale, but I don't own 
a  beard and woolly Fair-Isle sweater) I prefer the kind  of  pint 
where annilation is possible in a short space of time and  total.. 
I also like good spirits, particularly a decent brand of whisky or 
cognac,  and  have been smashed on most red wines at some stage as 
well....

SOME  OTHER  METHODS:- Some people in Maggie  (Sammy  Joe)  prefer 
CIDER, or VODKA, which is not my own choice, but fine by me. There 
is also the phenomona of the BUSINESS FUNCTION or lunch,  where it 
is  expected that GIN and TONIC will be consumed,  often in  large 
quantities...  GIN  and  TONIC  is a suit and tie drink  (but  not 
unpleasant..)  If  you are a student,  then blackcurrant juice  in 
everything is compulsory, especially lager, cider, and PERNOD (the 
aniseed flavoured drink...) also SNAKEBITE (Lager/cider)..

This  gives an idea of the 'kit requirements' for a good  piss-up, 
another profitable area for exploration is the world of  COCKTAILS, 
which  are  usually  expensive and limited to a  few  places  with 
specialist knowledge,... Until the March edition of ST FORMAT that 
is.....  The cover disk has a brilliant little program which gives 
the recipes for zillions of well-known cocktails,  and it is worth 
taking some ingredients along with your ST to a friend, and giving 
it a go......

Enough  of the ingredients,  we go on to the controversial area of 
CAPACITY  (ho  hum),  the  usual argument being,  "The  more,  the 
better.."  which  is fair enough until you accumulate  a  whopping 
great  beer-gut...  However,  you want to avoid total lameness and 
running to the toilet after a pint and a half of naff lager.. Some 
authorities  put  it at 8-10 pints before you can fall  under  the 
table,  honour intact, but if you are a Rugby club member, it then 
becomes  'necessary' to be a 15-20 pint man..  It also depends  on 
the  company you are in at the time,  a group of mates (male) will 
give  an evening a competitive edge,  but it is not a good idea to 
get smashed and put your head down the toilet if it is a  romantic 
evening (Unless she is a very strange young lady..)

It  ultimately  depends on how far you want to go,  and  how  many 
braincells you wish to get rid of really, there is no 'set limit'.


To come on the third page........

Next,  the  exciting and strange question of the DURING and  AFTER 
EFFECTS of excess alchohol.....

This  is the whole reasoning behind consuming gallons  of  strange 
liquid TO GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD,  visit new planets,  get violently 
ill  on  them,  and bring back the best headache and gut-ache  you 
have experienced in your whole life!!

INTOXICATION:-   Has  many  suble  and  varying   characteristics, 
internal symptoms can go up to the sort of distortion effects that 
need 3 million % more processor time than a Cray 2 has got, really 
great light shows,  and the sensation that someone has removed all 
controlling muscle fibre and nerves from your body so you collapse 
to  the floor..  Also,  someone arranges it so that everything you 
say or do turns to shite,  and rearranges the bedroom furniture so 
you  don't  know where everything is anymore,  and puts napalm  up 
your  bottom  (More on that later).  It is also amazingly easy  to 
fall asleep just about anywhere,  under the nearest table,  on the 
platform  at  the  railway station,  on the railway track  at  the 
railway station...

EXTERNAL SYMPTOMS:- Again, these are various, a desire to sing very 
loudly  and off-key (See Karaoke evenings..),  a desire to consume 
large  amounts  of CURRY and takeaway food which  traces  a  fiery 
course  of  destruction  through  your guts,  a desire  to  hit  a 
policeman  and  get locked-up in the cells overnight  -  "Whatever 
will  your  wife/parents  say  sir!" and if you  are  in  any  way 
involved  in a rugby club,  an intense desire to either remove all 
your  clothing,  or  that of the nearest passer-by...  It is  also 
compulsory  for  some drunks to tell everybody that they  are  all 
right and great friends and breathe all over them all night...

SET  YOUR  GUTS FREE:- There is no way of dodging  this  one,  I'm 
afraid,  everybody  who has indulged to excess will know what I am 
talking about,  the PUKE,  the CHUNDER, PSYCHEDELIC YODEL, CHASING 
THE  BLUE  GOLDFISH,  BARF,  PARK THE TIGER,  more names than I can 
describe,  it can happen to anyone,  but lamers rather sooner than 
most,  the idea is either not to throw-up,  or be seen and provide 
cheap  gratuitious  entertainment  for  your  friends.   who  will 
sympathise,  but  have  a  really  good laugh at  you  as  well... 
Acceptable  places  to  throw include,  the toilet (But  not  most 
urinals..) outside in an unpopulated area,  a wastepaper bin (Take 
out  the  paper first!),  the North Sea....  UNACCEPTABLE  places, 
include   your  girlfriends  dinner,   your  girlfriends  handbag, 
underwater,  in  the  presence  of a policeman,  in a  policeman's 
helmet....  Your  parents hi-fi system is NEVER the same again  if 
you  resort  to using that to contain the malodorous  contents  of 
your stomach either, so don't go there!!!!

 (Coming up to the last page...)


THE MORNING AFTER:- Ha Ha Ha,,,, AAAAAAGGGGHHHHHH!!! as it is more 
commonly   known...   No  amount  of  "pre-pissup  training"   and 
simulation  runs  can prepare you for this unique  and  horrifying 
event,  take  my word for it,  you will just have to experience it 
for yourself.. But those of us on familiar territory will lovingly 
recall  the headaches caused by nuclear explosions,  one going-off 
after another,  the feeling that your gastro-intestinal system has 
been blow-torched from your body, and the feeling that you are now 
85  years old and ready for the graveyard...  Also,  your arse has 
been visited in the night by a formation of American B52  bombers, 
and  a  huge  fire  is raging  uncontrolled  there  which  becomes 
apparent  when  you first visit the toilet...  If you  are  really 
unlucky,  your  duvet has acquired a new overnight  'Pizza-effect' 
coating (See section above..)

The  right sort of breakfast can help or break you at this  point, 
IE,  none  at  all,  greasy bacon,  and runny eggs provoke a rapid 
toiletward  movement  in  order  to  'Do  the  Barf  Man'.  In  my 
experience,  eating  is a definate no-no,  stick to coffee (black, 
very  strong.)  if you insist on consuming  anything  the  morning 
after...

The  amazing thing is,  that alchohol must target and destroy  the 
braincells  which contain these harrowing experiences,  otherwise, 
why do people (Myself included) go back for more???

THat is the end to the first of these 'How to' guides, I hoped you 
enjoyed  it,  in  spite  of a lot of it stating  the  obvious  and 
commonplace....

 (C) CIH 25/2/91

 P.S. Please feel free to send any spare alchohol or donations for 
a piss-up to me at the Maggie correspondance address... 

 Once again. GOODBYEEEEE!!!!!!
