This  is  another  of  those games which  has  been  a  long  time 
arriving, as people and particularly the computer maggies have had 
'exclusive previews' since the year dot (about 1989 actually).  It 
has actually been out on general release in France for some  time, 
but has only just made it to the U.K.  (It is the UK version being 
reviewed..)

B.A.T  is a graphically-based icon driven adventure  thingy set  in 
the  distant future on the planet Selenia,  which is  inhospitable 
but  wealthy.  There  is  an  immediate problem  with  a  talented 
meglomaniac  called  VRANGOR (ho ho!) (NB.  No relation of  Stock, 
Aitken,  and Waterman who are untalented meglomaniacs..) who wants 
ownership of the planet,  and has planted sixteen very large bombs 
to  ensure  he  gets his way....  You come in as an agent  of  the 
Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters (B.A.T.) to sort out Vrangor once 
and for all.

You are on Selenia,  and start by searching for his accomplice,  a 
petty criminal Merigo,  who escaped with Vrangor.. And from there, 
you have the whole city to search through... This is, fortunately, 
made  easier in presentation terms,  as the graphics are of a very 
high  standard throughout.  The graphics indeed establishing  pre-
release  interest  in the game.  They effectively convey a  seedy, 
atmospheric  background  of the city of  Terrapolis,  which  looks 
rather   like  an  intersteller  Reeperbahm,   a  cross,   between 
BLADERUNNER and Hamburg.  The best use of colours has been made to 
get  the appropriate menacing shadows,  and the animations  within 
each  still frame are numerous and convincing (that there is  life 
going on all around you..)

Sonically  the game benefits from the addition of the  MV16  sound 
cartridge,  which can give up to 16 (mono) voices,  but is used in 
B.A.T.  to play back several four-channel tunes. These change when 
there  are  significant  location changes,  to give  a  movie-like 
character.   The tunes themselves are high-quality,  and would not 
be  out  of  place  on  an Amiga  (hack  spit!).  There  are  also 
occasional  spot-effects over the top of the tune,  and whilst  in 
the artificial park, even birdsong!

An  additional  note on the MV16 cartridge (for  those  who  don't 
already   know..)  It  is  an  unprepossesing   cardboard   thing, 
containing a PCB and a 3.5mm headphone socket. This does give very 
good  sound  quality through headphones,  and is  compatible  with 
stereo AUX sockets as well.  As this has been around in France for 
some  time,  there are already a number of soundtrackers which are 
compatible,   ST-Connexion,   Equinoxe  MOD  players,  the  EMPIRE 
NOISETRACKER   program,   the  forthcoming  SYNC  AUDIO  SCULPTURE 
program, and (apparently) REPLAY 4.... There is also a forthcoming 
16-track   soundtracker   from  UBISOFT   specifically   for   the 
cartridge..  Generally,  anything  recent,  and  in the future will 
make  use of this cartridge (With the important exception  of  TCB 
Tracker, they have their own cartridge...)

Back  to  the  game,  it uses a mouse-driven  system,  the  cursor 
changing  according  to what actions you can carry  out,  such  as 
talking to characters, moving, using telephones, paying for items, 
etc...  The game starts in the Spaceport, where you proceed to the 
gents   toilets   (Adapted  for  all  anatomies,   but  not   very 
pleasant...)  where you get a "Mission Impossible" style  briefing 
(This  time,  the  agent self-destructs) and a hatfull of  usefull 
equipment, including some hand-held 'artillery' Thus equipped, you 
go  to  search  for  Merigo,  the link to VRANGOR,  in  the  city. 
Interaction  with  other  characters is a bit  limited  to  a  few 
specific questions,  with repetitive answers,  any genuinly useful 
information  usually requires hard cash to get it,  and can be  of 
doubtful value...

There are a variety of locations to explore in the city, there are 
1100  in the game as a whole,  and we are informed,  that there is 
more than one route to the conclusion of this adventure,  and that 
a fair proportion of time can be given to the dubious pleasures of 
Terrapolis... These include visits to shops, a park, several bars, 
arcades, a cinema of an 'X-rated' nature, and a club of a similar 
bent.  (Unfortunately,  for  the  English  language version,  this 
aspect  of  the  game  has been  toned-down,  as  any  "Horizontal 
Boogying" has been replaced with a dancefloor scene and a  cryptic 
message.. BOO-OORRING!!!)

There  is  also,  a  further  undergound city,  and a  3-D  flight 
simulator  which allows you to get to other parts of  the  planet, 
and presumably, Vrangors hideaway... (I have yet to get to these)
You can also bribe,  purchase, sell, steal, or shoot, according to 
your situation,  but this will affect the views of the local police 
towards you. Also, VRANGOR is aware that someone is after him, and 
has  a  pack  of  KILLER  ROBOTS who  will  ask  for  your  liver, 
politely..

This  paragraph deals with your on-board computer BOB,  built into 
your forearm. This useful bit of kit, monitors your health, allows 
you to speak to to robots and aliens in their language, and can be 
programmed  to warn you of any impending nasties.  It has it's own 
simple  programming language,  and programs can be saved to  disk 
for later use..

What more? well, look at the ratings and play it for yourself...

GRAPHIX:-  89% - Very well done,  atmospheric,  within ST pallette 
limitations, with tons of animations to give it a 'live' feel, the 
game is an adventure,  with only limited arcade interaction.  Some 
graphics, slightly 'Raunchy'.....

SONIX:-  87%  -  Unusually  lots  of  thought  here...   Done  via 
specifically designed cartridge,  high quality 4-voice digi-tunes, 
and some spot FX, several tunes within game which change from time 
to time....

PLAYABILITY:- 79% - Interaction via mouse,  other characters a bit 
limited  in responses,  but large range of places to experience do 
make up for this, when information does arrive, be prepared to pay 
for it....

OVERALL:-  87% - Another brave attempt to do  something  different 
with  the  standard  adventure format,  expensive,  but  the  MV16 
cartridge,  combined  with mail-order make it better value than it 
might have been.. The cartridge looks crummy, but is quite good in 
delivering clear sound.....
