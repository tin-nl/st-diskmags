                              By Michael Schuessler

After  we  haven't  had any cheats for the  last  few  issues,  I 
managed to collect a few more which I will now present to you. If 
you have or know of any more demo cheat codes PLEASE PLEASE  send 
them to us.

THE SKID ROW DEMO
-----------------
     There are two hidden screens in this demo, I personally have 
not seen them yet but I suppose that they are well worth  looking 
at.  In  order to get to the first screen you have to go  to  the 
ACF3  screen  and on the opposite of that you can find  the  Anti 
Amiga  Song Screen.  The other hidden screen is opposite  to  the 
TRT1 screen and it's called the Hidden Screen.

MAGGIE ISSUE 4
--------------
     For maggie issue 4 when you want to read the hidden  article 
you must enter TLB in the first three questions.  This means that 
you  have to enter the T in the first question,  L in the  second 
question and B in the third question. You will then have a choice 
of two articles,  the first one is a review of the Pissflaps Porn 
Demo and the second one is the usual bollox and song lyrics.

MAGGIE ISSUE 3
--------------
     In Maggie issue 3 you must simply type in 68000 in order  to 
get to the hidden article.

 
SYNTAX TERROR DEMO
------------------
     Here  we  go with the last cheats for this  issue.  For  the 
first screen type in Gesichtkondom at the beginning of the  demo. 
To  be more specific you must type it in when all the text  comes 
up telling you what the Syntax Terror demo is not. 
     To  get to the second hidden screen you must go on the  main 
menu  to  the  section  where all the  Delta  Force  Members  are 
mentioned and there you move up and down with the cursor keys and 
pressing  the  space  bar after each time you  have  pressed  the 
curosr key.

MAGGIE 5
--------
     Tuff luck,  the hidden article has not yet been written  and 
therefore  I  can't tell you the cheat but I suppose it  will  be 
something like TLB or at least in that direction.
     
     So this is it for the cheats in this issue,  as I have  said 
at the top, please keep them coming in !!!!!!
