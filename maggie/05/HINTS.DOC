 Hello and welcome to the HINTS 'N' TIPS section by OLI G. In this 
article, I  hope to bring you some of the best and  latest  cheats 
around.  If you have any cheats which you have found yourself  and 
haven't been published in other magazines then send all your cheats 
to ST MAGGIE,  the address is in this magazine somewhere.  O.K. is 
everybody comfortable? Then I shall begin.


 YOLANDA.

  Are you one of those poeple who just can't get passed  the first 
level on Steve Bak's (Chriss sorrel's) new game Yolanda? Then this 
little cheat  is probley for you.  First  wait  till the  game has 
finished loading and press fire.  Now type in the  word  GUPPY and 
press fire again. Now you should have infinite lives and by pressing 
space will take you on to the  next screen. Now there's no excusse 
for a low score. 

 FLOOD.

   I'm sure there just one level you just don't know how to do  on 
Flood.  Well  now  you  can  go to any level  you  like  with  the 
following level codes.
  
  Level No.   Password      Level No.   Password

     (1)        FROG          (2)         YEAR
     (3)        QUIF          (4)         LONG

     (7)        WINE          (8)         GRIP
     (9)        TRAP          (10)        THUD
     (11)       FRAK          (12)        VINE
     (13)       JUMP          (14)        NILL

     (21)       HATE          (22)        REED
     (23)       LIME          (24)        QUID
     (25)       WING          (26)        FLEE
     (27)       GIGA          (28)        HEAD
     (29)       LOOP          (30)        SING
     (31)       JOUX          (32)        PINK
     (33)       GOGO          (34)        LETS
     (35)       QUAD          (36)        BRIL
     (37)       EGGS          (38)        HENS
     (39)       NAIL          (40)        SOAP
     (41)       FOAM          (42)        MEEK

You should type these in when it asks you to enter level password.
Once you've typed it in press return and then fire to sart the game.

 IMPOSSAMOLE.

  This game  really needs a cheat.  Its almost  as  hard  as  Rick 
Dangerous. O.K. for this one you must first get a high score. Once 
on the high score table type :

   HEINZ... = FOR EXTRA SOUPS.    COMMANDO = INFINATE WEAPON TIME.
   OOCHOUCH = WALK ON WATER.      ANNFRANK = EXTRA ENERGY.
   LUMBAJAK = EXTENDED ENERGY BAR JUGGLERS = NOT SURE.

When I found the cheat JUGGLERS I typed it in like the others  but 
nothing seemed to happen. I spent about 5 days trying to work out 
what it did, so if you find out contact me.

 7 GATES OF JAMBALA.

  In issue 1.0 there was a cheat for the Thalions  loader  screen. 
Well here's a cheat for one of Thalions best games which  features  
realy smooth scrolling. This one's a bit of a bugger to make  work
because  there's  so  much  to  do.  On  the  title  screen  type
YICKE YACKE H[HNERKACK.  Now hold down the left shift button, hold  
down  1 release  1 and now release left shift button.  The writing
at  the bottom  of  the  screen will hopefully turn  blue. You now
have infinate lives,  start the game and the keys 1 to 7 will take  
you to  the required  level.  Also F1 to F5  selects weapons and G 
give's you gold.

 E-MOTION.

  On  the title screen,  type MOONUNIT now F1 will advance  you  1 
level, F2 ten levels, F4 back ten levels. Its as easy as that. I 
hope!!
  

 STRYX.

  When  your  in the game hold down the keys  M,  D  and  HELP  to 
replenish  your  energy.  Also hold down P and HELP  to  get  door 
passes.

 Well that about rounds it up for this time.  But before I go I
