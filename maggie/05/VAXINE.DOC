Strange and Unusual Dept..........

This  is the Assembly Line's latest stab at the ST market,  and  a 
"sequel"  to E-MOTION,  but wuth the difference that it is  three-
dimensional this time,  (and the gameplay is somewhat different..) 
The  outstanding  feature of this game are  the  "100%  Ray-traced 
graphics"  which  feature over 100 colours on the ST  alone,  with 
extra enhancements for the STE,  a first for a major game (but see 
my additional notes in ROTTSPOTT re. JAMES POND...)

This range of colours makes for a very pretty game indeed, there a 
some  attractive  title  screens  and then on  to  the  main  game 
screen,  which is a fast and smoothly moving chequerboard pattern, 
against  a  graduated  sky  (lotsa  colours..)  The  'Enemy'   are 
represented  by ever-increasing numbers of ahem,  ROUND  SPHERICAL 
OBJECTS  which join together in complex twisting  patterns.  there 
are also half-submerged balls (the body cells you are  defending.) 
not  to mention black slabs which rise and lower into  the  floor, 
which  are  the  time-freezing portals...  On the STE,  there  are 
definitely  more colours,  and less use of stippling,  than on the 
standard version.  Interestingly enough, this game looks better on 
a standard colour T.V set,  than on a monitor,  as the blurred T.V 
picture quality works in your favour for once....

All in all, this could be the start-up screen for the Carebears or 
Lostboys latest demo,  and this is definitely a "Programmers game" 
like  VIRUS.  The sonic side of things has been well taken care of 
too,  there is a 4-track Digitised title tune, and all the in-game 
sound effects are sampled as well... The quality is reasonable, if 
a  little  crackly,  as even on the STE,  the YM 2149 does all the 
playback work....

Playing it is definitely an accquired skill,  as you deal with the 
enemy  viral incursion by firing-off your own balls!  (YIKE!!) you 
have to take inertia, velocity etc into account, so it is a little 
difficult at first, but you soon get the idea. The basic aim is to 
safeguard the body-cells or bases against virus attack for as long 
as possible and to build up a high score in doing so. These little 
bleeders  get  tough  with  you  after  a  short  while,  as  ever 
increasing  numbers  are pumped on screen,  if you are  not  quick 
enough. In the end they will get you!!!!!

You  are  on  a limited ammunition supply,  but can  get  more  by 
shooting  bonus stars which appear,  and you have a sort of  semi-
smart bomb when you fire chains of DNA molecules which hang around 
waiting for something nasty to destroy. Ultimately, this is a pure 
arcade  type  game,   with  what  is  pretty  basic  gameplay  and 
objectives wrapped within a superbly programmed enviroment...

What do the ratings say????????

GRAPHIX:- 91% - These are a major attraction, in the game they are 
smooth, fast, and extremely accomplished....

SONIX:-  79%  - Reasonable Digi-music on the title  screen  (which 
soon gets repetitive unfortunately...) and a wide range of varying 
sound effects for the game itself which complement the action....

PLAYABILITY:-  72%  -  A game which has to be  learned,  but  once 
learned,  it is mildly addictive,  but not really a good long-term 
player.... 

OVERALL:-  82% - Worth a look,  if you can get it cheap (At œ24.99 
it  is  far too expensive,  even if it is well  programmed...)  It 
could have done with some variation in gameplay, objectives etc to 
hold longer-term interest....
