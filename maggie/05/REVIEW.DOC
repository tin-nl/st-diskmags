***********

Hi and welcome to the first film review written by Highlander
for the Lost Boys Disk Mag.
This edition is quite long, further editions won't be as long 
because the Lost Boys Mag will be up to date with films and also
i am doing my last year at Techincal College so i won't have
as much time to do this.
The way i have gone about doing this doc is that i have used the
best reviews from film mags (The Empire, film review etc..)over 
the past few months and also thrown in my own opinions about 
the film. After each review their will be a star rating which 
will be combined rating of all magazines ratings and my personal 
feelings of the films. The star rating is as follows : -

* * * * *    - Unmissable
* * * *      - Very Good
* * *        - Good
* *          - Fair
*            - Tragic 
 
Also at the end of the doc will be a rating chart for the most popular
films here in the U.K and also in the U.S. This information will
be gained from Empire which is a the best film review mag on the 
market.
Some of the reviews i will put in this edition may be a few months 
old however i would like to get the lost boys mag well up to date with
films over the last few months and if this doc is liked i will continue 
to do this as long as it is wanted.

Now enjoy the review......


DICK TRACY
**********

This film was directed by Warren Beatty. The main stars are ...
   
   Warren Beatty
   Madonna
   Glenne Headly
   Mandy Patinkin

Cert - P.G -
Made in the - U.S -
The Film lasts for about 120 mins.
This film is on general release throughout the U.K

You all rember the comic strip hero of Dick Tracy and the cartoon 
series which consisted of Dick Tracy fighting off all evil people
and putting law and justice back into America. So some bright spark
had the idea of making Dick Tracy into a real person who would bring 
criminals down to there knees. 
Like Batman, the background tends to upstage the characters in the 
foreground, most dominatingly in the seven colours that reflect the
limited palette in which comics appeared in the 30s and 40s.
The acting is as exaggereted as the make up. As Breathless Mahoney,
Madonna retains enough three dimensionality to distinguish her from
the rubber faced grotesques in whose world she sings and dances, while 
Beatty eshews the hatchet like profile of the orignal`tec and is an 
underplayed, enigmatic presence amid the lurider than life muggings 
everywhere else.
I will not discuss the plot of this film as it will spoil it before you 
have even entered the cinema. The problem with this film is the same 
with Batman  (which was released about this time last year) is that
the film seems to rely on the hype of the media to boost it`s viewing
figures. Action is ok but a bit sparse compared to what you thought 
Dick Tracy would do in real life. The colours the film does contain 
when you watch it is really amazing, something which i have not seen 
used since the epic film 'FLASH GORDON'. 
My conclusion of this film is that Dick Tracy lacks the action kids
expect from these blockbusting celebrations of old time Amercia. This
film suffers what i felt Batman suffered from the old 'once you have 
seen it thats it'. However on the whole Good to watch once but no more

TREMORS
*******

This film was directored by Ron Underwood. The main stars are 

   Kevin Bacon (Star of Footlose)
   Fred Ward
   Finn Carter

Cert - 15 -
Made in the U.S.A
Runs for abount 96 mins
On general release throughout the U.K

A folksy desert community is terorised by man eating, sand burrowing
worms which turn out to be merely the mouth tentacles of much larger
creatures. Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are dim witted cowboy handyman 
who discover the monsters and proceed to spend their time arguing
about what they ought to be called or trying to think of a way of 
turning the creatures into a profitabele business, while heroine 
Finn Carter is a seismologist who gets irrated when the locals expect 
her to be an instant expert on the life cycle of the monsters just
because she is a scientist. The film continues with the small town
folk being overturned by these man eating monsters. As the film 
progresses the town folk start to grown a bond between each other
in a desprete effet to destroy the man eating monsters. Tremors
becomes more supenseful as a small group of the monsters surround 
the town which then forces them to be marouned on the roofs of there
home. The film ends with a large climax.
This film has been put together very well. You can see that this 
film is a lowish buget film as it entails. However the acting is 
well done by the more experienced actors but you can see that 
some are slighty new to the acting field. But these are only minor
faults to a well devised film with some very neat special effects and 
good remarks in certian places. This film contains alot of tongue and 
cheek humour which is very funny in places.
A film well worth watching if only to see the man eating monsters.

LORD OF THE FLIES
*****************

This film was directed by Harry Hook. Its main stars are

  Paul Balthazr Getty
  Chris Furrh
  Danniel Pipoly

Lord of the flies is about a plane carrying miltary academy cadets
(all aged about ten) across some islands during the second world 
war. The inventiable happens and the plane crashes, with the piolt
in a deep coma and the children all alone on a deserted island. The 
story follows how they break up into different gangs and result in 
there being one main gang which are classed as the hunters. There
are a few other children who are in no ones group and are always
getting teased and also there camp raided by the hunters. When the 
story unfolds into an enjoyable tail of how children would surive
on a deserted island.
After being made to watch this film and read the book at high school, 
when i came to this it was with a feel in my mind that this film
would contain the same storey line exactly and the same words. So 
i thought why the hell have they re done this film. 
Well how wrong i was this film is well worth watching even though the
stroy line is nearly the same as the 1963 first attempt of this 
film. The part what makes up for this is the class acting, just to 
think of it these young lads can act better than some of todays big
stars. If you liked the first one or even if you didn`t, watch this
film anyway.

RE-ANIMATOR II (U.S.A name for film is The Bride of Re-Animator)
**************

This film was directed by Brian Yuzna. The films main stars are

  Jeffrey Combs
  Bruce Abbott
  David Gale

Cert - 18 -
Made in the - U.S.A -
On general release in selected cinemas in the U.K

The Re-animator in question, Dr Herbet West (Jeffrey Combs), is 
trying to revive the heart of the first movie's heroine, linking
it to the head of a terminal hospital patient with the aid of the 
amniotic fluid certain peruvian igunanas. The severed head, meanwhile, 
of west's arch-enemy (Gale) is still active, and getting around on 
batwings. West has also, perhaps unwisely, botched together a celarful
of monsters who, in the way that they so often do, turn upon their 
creator.
Most of the cast returns from the original movie. Their has basically
been no change of the story line as this and the original movie is 
the same. What makes the movie quite good is the special effects, as 
they are first rate. Also the humour is also very good espcially the
creature which consists of four fingers and and eye ball, harmless until
it is reanimated. Worth watching if you are either a fan of H.P Lovecraft
(the person who wrote the story(i am a fan and have read most of his 
books)) or a fan of gore.

BACK TO THE FUTURE III
**********************

This film was directed by Robert Zemeckis. The films main stars are

  Michael J Fox
  Christopher Lloyd
  Mary Steenbergen
  Thomas E Wilson

Cert  - P.G -
Made in  - U.S.A -
Runs for 118 mins
Now On general release in the U.K

At the end of Back To The Future II, Doc Brown (Lloyd) was stranded
in 1885 while young Marty Mcfly (Fox) was in 1955; now, learning 
that doc is due to be backshot by a varmint of the Old West, Marty
returns to the 1880's, and we get a enjoyable science fiction Western
packed with Jules Verne - style steam engines and plenty of neat jokes.
Arriving in the 1885 dressed in an absurd set of fringed buckskins 
that accurately reflect a 1959's Roy Rogers idea of a cowboy outfit, Fox
quickly gets more relistic clothes which actually look to have come from
the 1880's. Now Adopts the most famous cowboy name ,,, 'Clint Eastwood'.
The villain in this esparsart is Buford Tannen (Wilson), the thuggish
outlaw ancestor of the bullies who terrorised Marty in various other
parts of the other two films.
The story line of this film is the same as the other too. In case you
don't know what the story line of the other too, well in a few words
Marty Mcfly and Doc Brown have to get home to the 1980's.
This film is very funny in parts and scenes which happen in this film
happened in the other two movies. A part to represent this is, rember 
the brill skateboarding and hoverboard chase from the other two films,
well in this one they have a chase on horses etc.. A problem i found
with the film was because of it being in the wild west there wasn't much
that could be done with special effects, so this meant the film was 
just a western. I wonder myself why they chose the wildwest, when they
could have chosen the times of merlin the magician, never mind. This
is still a film worth watching and the saga is actually brought to 
a close. So this is the last Back to the future, maybe not as good
as the second one but one to see.

TOTAL RECALL
************

This film was directed by Paul Verrhoeven. The main stars are

  Arnold Schwarzengger
  Rechel Ticotin
  Sharon Stone
  Ronny Cox
  Michael Ironside

Cert - 18 -
Made in the - U.S.A -
Runs for around 109 mins
On general release in the U.K

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a humble construction
worker in the 21st Century who has bad dreams about Mars, where 
he's never been, and a beautiful woman he's never met. Dropping
by a futuristic hoilday firm where you can be injected with the
memories of a wonderful two week vacation someone else took for 
you, Quaid freaks out before he can be given a fantasy filled 
trip to Mars in the guise of a secret agent on a vital mission,
and then discovers that everyone, including his loving wife of
eight years, now wants to kill him. A mystery man gives him a
message from himself, in which he alleges that Quaid is a fake
persona used to bury alive Hauser, former associate of the dictator
of Mars who switched sides and tried to join a rebellion led by
mutants, and if he follows a trail left for him to the Red Planet,
he will be able to kick plenty of baguy ass and get his own back 
on the villan (Cox) who did him the dirt.
So that is the main plot of the film. Well overall a brill  movie
indeed, in fact the best science fiction i have seen of the 90's.
I must point out that this film is very violent (but so are all
other schwarzenegger films) and contains some quite gory scenes.
This film could possibly be his best or if not it certaintly equals 
his performance in The Teminator. 
Don't miss this either for the film itself or just to look at 
the fit women in it.

Personally i dont't think Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever starred 
in a bad movie yet. If you are like me and a real big fan  of him
then read on. How many of you know how many films Arnie's starred 
in, well here is a complete list of his films (if i have made any
mistakes here then tough) : -

Stay Hungry made in 1976 was Arnie's first film ever. Quick summery
of the story line is that it's about a guy entering Mr.Universe
competion, thats it basically. This film was a bit wierd to understand,
also starred Jeff Bridges. Star Rating * * *
Pumping Iron made in 1976, never seen this.
Conan The Barbarian made in 1982, this film made him famous, film 
about the days of the old sword fighting. Star Rating * * *
Conan The Destroyer made in 1984, follow up to Conan The Barbarian
Star Rating * * *
The Terminator made in 1984, this film was his best along with 
Total Recall, this film is about a robot sent from the future to kill
the mother of a person who is born in the future. 
Star Rating * * * *
Red Sonya made in 1985, this film is about sord stuff again, probably
his worst movie yet. Star Rating * *
Commando made in 1986, film about war etc between a ex solider and
kidnappers/drug smugglers. Star Rating * * *
Raw Deal made in 1986, film about police. Star rating * *
The Running Man made in 1987, film about a game show in the future
were you can get killed for real. Star Rating * * * *
Predator made in 1987, film about an alien killing his task force
in the jungle. One of my favourtes. Star Rating * * * *
Red Heat made in 1988, film about Russian cop and Amercian cop
breaking a drug operation. Star Rating * * * *
Twins made in 1988, film anout him learning to live with his 
twin in the real world while getting involved with the bad guys.
Very funny. Star Rating * * * *
 




GREMLINS II
***********

This film was directed by Joe Dante. The films main stars are
 
  Zach Galligan
  Phoebe Cates
  John Glover
  Christopher Lee

Cert - 12 -
Made in the - U.S.A -
Running time About 107 mins
Now on general release in the U.K

The first Gremlins film was very good, however this has done nothing
different except, copy the same theme from the original script. 
It again suffers the same as Re Animator 2 has suffered. I won't 
even discuss the story line as i feel it is no different than the 
original. All i will say is that the same rules apply to this film 
: -

* Don't feed them after midnight
* Never give them water

We've all seen this story before but most people will want to see 
it again. If the production crew has put more time into a better
story line than making the gremlins be total arse holes through 
the film, then maybe this film would have been great. But as it 
stands it's ok. I have given this two different star ratings as
i feel the younger audinence will like it more than us older people.

SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL
********************

This film was directed by Stan Dragoti. Thes films main stars are
 
  Tony Danza
  Walliace Shawn
  Ami Dolenz

Cert - P.G -
Made in the - U.S.A -
Now on general release in the U.K

Right first we have a L.A widower, and at this moment he has been
dating a women who drives a flashy sports car. Danza's daughter 
(Dolenz) turns fifteen and so her braces are removed, her glasses
replaced for contact lenses, her her changes and she gets flashy 
clothes. Soon she shruges off the image of being the fourteen 
year old kid and soon she is getting very popular with all the 
boys at school etc. Danza feels he must consult a psychiatrist 
(Shawn) to get his jealousy under control. This film basically 
carries on where Danza is getting very paranoid over all the lads
his daughter is dating. So he starts to actually get to know all her
biyfriends and try to be one of the boys. The film criticts said 
this film was crap, well i don't agree as all famous film critics
(like Jack Yeovil(never heard of him well have a look at an edition
of Empire and see his shit reviews)) are dick's anyway. Tony Danza 
is a very good actor and got very famous from a American series which
i think was called 'Who's the Boss. And now The U.K has a very
big rip off of Who's the Boss on I.T.V has on tele at the moment.
Back to my conclusion of this film is that is quite funny and very 
enjoyable film to watch. This film actually shows what a lot of 
parents go through now a days concerning there daughters getting 
layed etc. Anyway a good film to see.

DIE HARD II

This film was directed by Renny Harlin. The films main stars are 

  Bruce Willis
  Bonnie Bedelia
  William Atherton
  William Sadler
  John Amos

Cert - 18 - 
Made in - U.S.A -
Runs for around 122 mins.
Now on general release in the U.K

I won't give to much away about this film as it will spoil it. So
the main plot is that John McClane (Willis) is at the airport 
waiting to his wife to arrive from abroad somewhere. The airport
is overrun by a renegade special forces who dis-able all the controls
at the control tower, so incoming planes cannot land. That's the main
plot and McClane is left single handed to destroy all the bad lads. 
Some very good stunts in this film, espically the fight at the end of 
the film, on the wing of a plane. 
Lots of action quite a good story line and lots of dead people makes
this film well worth watching, it does suffer slightly from being a 
sequal but don't they all.

He finds a verteran called Harry (Duvall) and under his expert 
tutelage he on the American stock car circuit. Thats it really, 
not my type of film but not bad.

Danny Scoular (Neeson) is out of jail, out of work and just about 
out of time with his disappointed wife (Whalley Kilmer) in a depressed
Scottish community where the unemployed men reminisce about fighting
the good fight in the 1983 miners' strike. A large, rather butch 
sort of bloke, Danny naturally attracts the intrest of a local 
gangster (Bannen), who employs him to fight an illegal, big 
stakes bare knuckle fight in Glasgow.
Not bad but not brill but what do you expect from a British movie.
