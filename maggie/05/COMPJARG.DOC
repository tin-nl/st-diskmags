  A brief explination of some word that you may come across  in  a 
magazine.

 "Standard"     - We   don't   know  enough   about   other 
interfaces to know why it won't work on yours.

 "Universal Standards"    - We have tryed it on an STE.

 "Industry  Standards"     - We  copied  the  design   from 
someone else, and they say it works.

manufacturers.

early.

 "Obsolete"     - We've  had  it in stock for more  than  a 
week.

 "Will  be available shortly"   - We haven't actually  made 
one yet, but we can forsee no problems.

 "Will  be available late in the year"    - We dicovered  a 
few problems.

 "Will be available sometime next year"  - We lost the blue

 "Easily  expandable"      - There are a lot of sockets  on

 "Uses  your  own TV as a display"    - Sometimes  you  may 
actually read what is on the display as well.

 "Operating system"       - something we sell you every six

 "The  applications are only limited by your own  imagination"    -
 We can't think of anything useful it can do but it looks good.

 "Programs  can be saved to any standard disk drive"     - This  is 
any disk drive except the one you actually own at the moment.
 
 "User  friendly"     -  You  are asked  every  little  option  and 
parameter  to  see if it needs to be  included.   This  will  take 
atleast  10 minutes and you will have to go through the whole  lot 
again if you want to change anything.

 "A  must for every ST owner"   - It's nothing new and we  couldn't 
think of anything original to say.

about to be discontinued.

 "Powerful"     - It's so good even we can't understand it.

 "Advanced"     -  So complex even the programmer can't  understand 
it.

 "Easy  to  use"  - The average postgraduate  of  computer  science 
should experience no difficulty.
