Yep, I'm back again to review loadsa old games which you will 
never wanted to buy. I think I'll tell you which I'm reviewing 
now so if you've got them you can bugger off. They are Marble 
Madness, Return to Genesis, Roadwars, Summer Olympiad and 
Wizball. Okay, here we go.....

                       Marble Madness

When Marble Madness first came out it cost an astonishing œ24.99 
(not so astonishing nowadays). In the game you have to control 
your ball (ooer) down a tracky thingy wotsit. You have a certain 
amount of time to do it in (ooer) and if you run out of time you 
die. Marble Madness is quite an enjoyable game when you first 
start to play it. It turns out, however, that it is infact a 
"AArrrrrggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! I'm so annoyed that I think I want to 
wack my joystick round the head of the person who made this 
game!!!" game. When I play this game (which is very rarely) I 
always get to the same part of the same level. This is quite 
annoying and detracts seriously from it's playability.
Grafixxxx are nothing special and the musix is crap.

                   RETURN TO GENESIS

This game is a sort of looking from above horizontally scrolling 
shoot 'em up. I haven't played it much (basically coz I get 
killed within 10 secs of starting) but I thought I would review 
it anyway.
Grafixxxx are pretty good and there is quite alot of sampled 
sound (things like "Game Over" and "League of Heros").

                      ROAD WARS

Uuugghhh!! If you haven't heard of this game then I don't think 
you want to. It's basically crap with a capital C. I don't think 
I'll even bother telling you what you have to do on this game coz 
it might make it sound vaguely good.
The grafixxxx are probably the best bit on this game but thats 
not saying much. I can't remember what the sounds like but I can 
imagine.

                     SUMMER OLYMPIAD

This is not a bad game actually. You can guess by the title what 
it is about (can't you?). The events you have to choose from are: 
Skeet (clay pigeon shooting), High Diving, Triple Jump, Fencing 
and 100m hurdles (a joystick breaker!). Overall its quite good. 
The best events are probably Skeet and maybe fencing. 
Grafixxxx are very good in this game, different musixx is played 
for each event.

                         WIZBALL

This may sound like we're back to marble madness when I say that 
you are a ball (ooer) in this game, but we're not. You are 
supposed to be some wizard and theres this place with no colour 
or something. You job is to get the colour back into the land. 
For some reason you turn into a green ball to do this and bounce 
around collecting and shooting. There are loadsa power ups you can 
get and quite a few different enemys as well.
Grafixxxx are okay and so is the sound. Its the gameplay that's 
the most promenant feature of this game though.

P.S. I still wouldn't buy Wizball unless it was at least œ4.99 or 
less. (it is one of the better Super Pack Games).......
