POPULOUS
  Start each game by using RAISE/LOWER land to create at least one 
large castle.  Place the SHIELD icon on the castles flagpole and when 
the green strength bar reaches about half-way, raise the land at one 
corner of the castle (creating a smaller castle) to kick out a 
traveller...  Lower the land at the corner, wait, and repeat at regular 
intervals.  In this way you have more manna and moe travellers to build 
with.
  When about to KNIGHT your leader, place the MAGNET on a clear piece 
of ground,  RAISE the land in a cone form about three levels, select 
GOTO MAGNET and search your land for large castles.  Once a traveller 
has been kicked out, again raise the land at one corner and immediately 
lower it to regain the castles.  Go back to your leader (at the 
flagpole) and check for swamps; the leader himself shoulb be OK since 
he will be on the cone of land and only flat land can be swamped.
  When you and the computer are closely matched, goto the region of the 
map where your buildings and his meet.  Go as far into his territory as 
you can while still retaining at least one of your buildings on the 
map, then raise the land as far as you can (or about four levels) to 
totally wreck his buildings.  This is more useful (and costs less 
manna) than a volcano and you can reclaim this land later without 
having to get rid of rocky outcroppings.
  Frequently the computer will swamp a large mass of your land and the 
first warning you will have is the squelch of one of your people 
drowning.  Pause the game immediately and find the affected area (look 
around your flagpole) and if its too large to deal with using the 
RAISE/LOWER then earthquake the whole lot.  The swamps disappear and 
you are left with only a small repair job instead of a lengthy 
RAISE/LOWER strategy.
  Knight as soon and as often as possible (even if the game looks won): 
you get lots of points of points for knights, although you should bare 
in mind that the ARMAGEDDON option seems to give you slightly more 
points, as the rules explain.
