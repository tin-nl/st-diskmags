                     FUTURE FOR THE LOST BOYS!!
                            by Manikin

     Although the programmers in TLB have been quite quiet so far 
this year this is going to start changing in the very near future 
and we thought that you,  the reader,  should be informed of  our 
plans.
     First  thing that will become visible on the scene is a  new 
game  by  Oxygene (Fabian Hammer).  This game is  called  MONSTER 
BUSINESS  and will be marketed by ECLIPSE  software,  the  people 
that brought you the ultra brilliant Wings of Death. Have no fear 
this game is nothing like my game! I guess this will please quite 
a  few  people.  I have a copy of it sitting at home  and  I  can 
honestly  say that it is really very nice.  Graphics are  by  the 
same  guy  who did all the graphics for Enchanted Lands  and  the 
music is by a new group of musicians called SYNTH DREAM. 
     We  are also well into the production of our  new  megademo, 
honest  there  really is some stuff coded!.  This  will  be  very 
different to stuff we have done in the past. It will be a mixture 
of demos and various other bullshit that enters into our tortured
brains.  We  reckon that it will be finished at either the  Delta 
Force  Convention or for The Dusseldorf Messe  '91.  Prepare, for 
this shall be the climax of the Lost Boys demos, almost certainly 
our last and hopefully our best.  The demo goes under the  rather 
long  name  of  OOH CRIKEY,  WHAT A  SCORCHER!  We  have  already 
discovered  hat nobody who is not English understands  what  this 
phrase means but I'm afraid that we like the title and so that is 
what it will be called!.
     It will indeed be a busy summer for not only do we intend to 
finsh of this megademo but we are also doing a new game.
     The  team  for  the game will  consist  of  Oxygene(Fabian), 
Digital  Insanity(Stefan),  Manikin  (Tim) who will  do  all  the 
programming for the game,  Spaz(Dave),  Tanis of TCB (Niklas) and 
Tyrem(Kimi)  who will do all the graphics.  As of yet we are  not 
sure  who  is going to market the game but it  will  probably  be 
eclipse. Stefan and Tim already worked out a concept for the game 
but for now we will keep it under our hats,  so you'll just  have 
to watch this space for news of its production.
     Well  we are a busy bunch of boys are we not?  I think  that 
that  just about covers everything that we will be doing  in  the 
near  future.  Look  out for our demo in the summer and  buy  our 
games  when  they  come out and you will make  us  a  very  happy 
collection of englishman, germans and dutchmen!

                                  All the best from TLB
