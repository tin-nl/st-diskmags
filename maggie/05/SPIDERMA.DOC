 REVIEWED (CIH)          (O.D.E.)

This  is a slightly different interpretation of one of  the  best-
known  Marvel  Comics characters of all.  Spiderman has had  three 
movies,  all  low budget things,  and an even lower budget cartoon 
series,  but like most 'cult' characters from the 'sixties,  he is 
now  the subject of a revival of interest,  apparently a new movie 
is  due,  and  in  the meantime,  heres the computer game  of  the 
licence...

The  plot  (ho-hum..)  Mysterio has  kidnapped  Mary-Jane  Parker, 
Spidy's  wife in order to lure him into a trap,  with a message to 
meet Mysterio at the deserted Rockwell Film studios at  midnight.. 
Cue Midnight,  and you are duly kitted-up A La Spiderman, and have 
to  battle  through the 56 room studio complex.  As it is  a  film 
studio, you get all kinds of scenery, including futuristic, zombie 
horror etc...

The  gameplay and graphic style are very reminiscent  of  platform 
games  such as MANIC MINER and JET SET WILLY on the  ZX  Spectrum, 
certainly, there is nothing graphically, that cannot be duplicated 
on an 8-bit machine,  the Spiderman sprite is just over 1 cm high, 
but is capable of a considerable range of movement,  as he is able 
to walk,  crawl,  cling to walls and ceilings, and swing from from 
strands of web that he shoots from his wrist dispensers.  Gameplay 
consists of progressing around the complex, finding and activating 
awkardly  placed  switches,  and  stunning or avoiding  the  robot 
guards.  These  take  up  the  'film' theme as well,  so  you  are 
avoiding  litle Robocops (?) mummies (Egyptian variety)  and  R2D2 
robots.

You  are  helped by the generous amount of energy  given  to  you, 
which  you  do not loose too quickly,  and the fact that  you  can 
usually  shoot a web to get you out of a tight spot,  and crawl or 
climb over most parts of the screen.  Sound is confined to in-game 
sampled  spot  effects  and the odd insane  laugh..  There  is  an 
original title tune (Somewhere,,) 

As time is short, onto the ratings...

GRAPHIX:- 64% - Decidedly mundane, could be easily duplicated on a 
Spectrum, but nice animation of the central Spiderman sprite.

SONIX:-  52%  - In this version,  limited to very  occasional  and 
unspectacular sampled spot FX, there is an original title tune out 
there somewhere????

PLAYABILITY:-  75%  - Plays like a less demanding JET  SET  WILLY, 
easy  to make progress using the central characters vast range  of 
movements... This is one for nostalgic ZX Spectrum freaks..

OVERALL:-  67% - Naffs out in the presentation dept,  but makes up 
for it in playability,  but it isn't one that you will play to the 
end, as it is rather slowly paced, sorry folks........
