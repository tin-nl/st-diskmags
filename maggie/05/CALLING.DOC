                    Part I (January 1991)

First of all a few words about this article!  It is dedicated  to 
the  german ST users because within the last year I made  several 
attemps  to activate some of them.  I'm still thinking about  the 
numbers of sold TURRICAN copies.  Within germany Rainbow Arts has 
sold  only  about 150 fucking copies of this  great  game  (first 
quarter!).  Think  about this .....  only 150  copies!  All  over 
europe  they have been able to spread about 2000 copies  of  this 
game (also first quarter!).
Next  to this it is obvious that most of the german ST users  are 
not able, or just to lazy, to activate themselves. Within england 
a  lot  of  people help the LOST BOYS and  Michael  SchÅssler  to 
create Maggie by sending articles and remarks.
Within  germany  I'm still waiting for any response and  I'm  not 
sure if their'll be one letter.

          "It is time to think about the consequences!"

Rainbow  Arts and several other software companies make up  their 
mind  if  they should produce and convert -- any -- software  for
the  Atari  ST.  The Atari ST is getting closer to the deep whole 
where  we find his grandparents , the Atari 800 XL which lost the
fight against the Comodore C64.
According  to the games the ST also lost this fight  against  the 
Amiga and he is going to lose it against the MS DOS machines, but 
their  is still a little hope and we all can learn from the  past 
and still keep the ST alive.

   "Stop playing and cracking all the time, buy the one or 

       the other original and start programming or something

                     else because The ST needs your help!!!!!!"

                    Part II (End of March 1991)

I  got  some further news about Turrican  II,  the  next  MEGAHIT 
produced by Rainbow Arts. They produced about 5000 copies for the 
first  time  and the game seems to be also an  example  that  you 
might be able to earn money producing games for the ST.
But if we compare this with the Amiga first day production (about 
15000 copies!) we will be fired back onto our feets! What's going 
wrong that Atari has lost THE FIGHT against other companies  once 
again (I think it has happened).
Is  it  the machine itsself using an 68000 but only  a  few  less 
powerfull costume-chips?  Mistakes in the competition?  The  hard 
competition:   Commodore   (sector:   games),   APPLE  and   NEXT 
(professionel work)!
The  consumer seems to watch out for a machine also  used  within 
some  years  and the ST and also the TT haven't got  this  "safe" 
future!
