I only got this game yesterday (for christmas! (I have just 
finished Mutant Monthly 3)) so this won't be a particularly in 
depth review.
As you all know (don't you?) Operation Stealth was made by the 
people who did Future Wars. If you have played Future Wars then 
you would be expecting something special from this game.
The basic outline of the game is that someone has stolen a plane 
(eh?). Okay, let me explain a bit more. It is all about the new 
fighter plane, The F-19 Stealth Fighter. This plane has been some 
how stolen from the place where it was being tested. It is your 
job as super spy John Glames to find out who is the shop lifter. 
The way you play the game is very similar to Future Wars. When 
you press the right mouse button you get a menu which gives you 
options of what you want to do: Examine, Inventory, Take, Use, 
Speak and one or two others which I can't think of. The annoying 
part I found in Future Wars was that if you were not standing in 
the right place when you wanted to look at/take something the 
computer would say "come a little closer". This doesn't happen in 
Stealth. If you click on something you want Glames to examine, he 
will automatically walk over to it. Not as much trouble as 
getting a monks habit out of a tree with a lance, if you know what 
I mean. 
The game begins with a very long intro which gets you into the 
feel of the game. Then you start in Washington D.C. where you 
talk to a character who looks distinctly like George Bush. He 
tell's you a bit about your mission and gives you a brief case. I 
this brief case you have such things as: a pen which squirts 
acid, a calculater which explodes and a passport forger. You can 
also pick other things up on the way, like a shaver which has a 
tape recorder hidden in it, a watch which has hidden cable inside 
and a thingy for cracking safes.
Armed with only you brief case you set of for Santa Parasomething 
(some strange country). This is where the adventure really 
begins.......
The grafixxxx in this game are very good. They are of the same 
quality as Future Wars. Sprites are detailed (Glames wears a suit 
and bo-tie and has slightly flared trousers!) and so are the back 
grounds. The musix is also good, again similar to Future Wars.
The gameplay is the main improvement Stealth has over Future 
Wars. Where Future Wars was very good, Stealth is excellent. You 
can exmine alot of things on the screen and talk to them as well. 
You can feel a bit stupid sometimes though, when you go up to a 
sheet of toilet paper and say "Hello, my name is Glames, John 
Glames". Problems are set at just the right level so you have to 
go back to them 2 or 3 times before you can solve them. 
Basically it is a very playable game.
