Start Date: 27/11/90.

Okay, okay! I know it's a little soon to start the next Mutant 
monthly but I simply haven't got anything better to do at the 
moment. I just recieved Maggie 3 this morning and it was a bit of 
a stonker I can tell you (if you haven't seen it already that 
is). At the moment I am in the middle of my mock exams and my 
parents have gone to a parents evening so the teachers can tell them 
how wonderful I am (well, maybe not...). 
About 30 mins ago I was watching the news to see what was going 
to happen in the elections. Major missed out getting an over all 
majority by 2 votes but the other two guys conceeded and so 
tomorrow England will have a new Prime Minister.  God, politics 
is boring isn't it? I think it's time for a change of subject. 

It has now been about ten days since TTMNT's first ever demo was 
realised. It is about six months since we first started this demo 
but we are all so lazy we just never did anything on it. The demo 
is called "The Quite Large Demo" (To see why we called it that 
you'll have to read the info scroller) and quite a few people 
should have it by the end of the year. At around Christmas we 
will be starting a new demo which will hopefully have a 
Mastersound 2 screen on it. Apparently MS2 can take samples of up 
to 16khz on the sequencer (unlike the 10khz of MS1) so it should 
be pretty descent. Infact I phoned up to order a copy (it's only 
a tenner when you upgrade from MS1) the other but everyone had 
gone home. I think our new demo will be called something like: 
"The Merry Christmas and Happy New Year (even though the last 
part of it is slightly unoriginal we just wanted a long title) 
Demo" but we're not sure yet.
 
                     KICK OFF 2 (Again!)

Yep, it was in last months article and it's here again! It is 
mega cuss down time for Amiga owners!!!  As I said last time 
there is this bloke who has got an Amiga called Anthony. Since 
the last article we made a bet about who was best at Kick Off 2. 
We decided to play 6 games (3 on ST, 3 on Amiga). If the score 
was 3-3 at the end of this we would play 2 more games (1 on each) 
and take the aggregate score. 
The first game to be played was on the ST. Basically I played 
amazingly and on a 2 by 20min game I won 20-1. This Anthony guy 
was pretty pissed of and swore revenge. So, about two weeks later 
I went round his house to give him a game. By half time I was 
winning 14-0!!!! At the end of the match the score was again 20-
1. I thought that was pretty good seeing as I never get anywhere 
near and amiga in my normal course of life.  Anyway, this means 
that I am still unbeaten on any computer, on 20 min each way 
games (boast, boast).

I think I'll go away now. I may not be back for a while coz I'll 
be writing other articles for this great mag. One more thing 
before I go, Maggie 3 was two disks and had about 2 million 
articles in but TLB are still asking people to write articles for 
the mag. Strange ay? I think things would get a bit awkward if 
the mag was on more than about five disks , don't you?......

I have just realised that two of my articles were not in the last 
issue of Maggie. I think this was because of Sammey Joes Hard 
Disk breaking and so they may be included in this issue. They're 
now a bit out of date though. They are: All Formats Computer show 
thingy and a Magazine review. I suppose the articles might not 
have been included in the last issue coz they were the crappiest 
piece of shit in the whole universe, but that can't be the reason
coz all my other stuff was included!!

Raphaels here so he may want a word or two (prepare to be 
insulted!).......
I'm sorry donatello but unfortunatlly i don't want to say sod 
all ( thats the name of one of my articales you know).....
so bugger off all you gays so donatello can carry on with this 
really interesting mutant monthly 3 so here is the gay 
himself!!!!!!!!!!!:
     take it away don!!!!
Thanx Raph. (you did know what to expect didn't you). I think 
that's all I'll type for the mo, see ya later......

Ahhhhhhhh shhhhhhhiiiiiiiittttttttttt!!!!!! (to put it mildly). I 
have just had my German exam. This is my worst subject. I was only 
taking the basic level aswell!!!! Actually I think I'll type a 
bit in German now just to show you how rubbish I am. Ready? Are 
we sitting comfortably? Good, then I'll begin.....

Guten tag! (erm.... well that was good wasn't it. Oops, I'm not 
supposed to be writing in English am I?)
Ich Heisse Donatello (This keyboard ain't got that strange letter 
which is supposed to be there instead of the ss. Ooops, speaking 
english again!)
Ich Bin 15 Jahre alt.
Ich wohne in England (can't remember how to spell that in German)
Ich habe ein schwester. Sie ist 17 Jahre alt. 
Ich habe keinen bruder.
Ich habe keinen what ever the german is for pets!

erm... well that seems to be it. Good wasn't it? I think it's 
pretty lucky that so many people know English, coz if they didn't 
then I'd really be stuck.

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Today is the 26/12/90!! 
Yes, that's right, Christmas has ended!!!!!!!!!!!!  For a 
Christmas present I got a memory upgrade so I now have a beefy 
one meg of memory. Well it's not that much memory but it's better 
than having a half meg and your ST saying "out of memory" every time 
you try to enlarge something (ooer etc) on Cyberpaint (this is 
not the only reason I got the upgrade).
  It took me two and a half hours to fit the upgrade coz I was 
watching Moonraker on the telly (I wasn't watching E.T.!). In the 
instructions it said it takes 1 to 1 1/2 hours, but that did not 
account for you having to look up every five seconds to see all 
the nice girls in short skirts!!!

Anyway, because it is almost the New Year and I don't know when 
Maggie 4 is being released, I think I'd better send this off to 
Sammey Joe. It'll probably turn out that Maggie 4 isn't released 
until February but I wanna make sure it's there on time. Sorry 
there wasn't any more crap in this article but I didn't have time 
to write any more! And there's another thing aswell. We haven't 
started our Christmas demo yet!!!!!!! Well, that's not entirely 
true, I did do a pretty nice font which was going to be on the 
Mastersound 2 demo, but when I got MS2 I found that you cannot 
have a scroller on the demo!!!!! This will probably mean that the 
demo is on two disks, with a MS1 demo (plus other stuff) on the 
second disk. 

Shall I have a greetz list before I go? Yeah, why not.....
The very short greetz go to: TLB, TNS, TBC and TCB.

That's all from me (unless you haven't been to the review section 
yet!),

          Bye!!!!!!!

          DONATELLO of TTMNT
