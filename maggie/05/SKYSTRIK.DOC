                      -----------  Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     This game is probably one of the worst games written on  the 
Atari ST. The graphics are shit, the sound is even  worse BUT the 
game play is superb. 

     The theme of the game is to fly around and shoot down  other 
planes,  destroy factories,  bombard airfields and take out enemy 
tanks.  

     About a year ago the first version of Skystrike was released 
with  only  a few different levels.  Now they have  released  the 
follow  up  containing about 25 different levels.  In  the  first 
level  you  have to shoot down 2 enemy planes.  This  already  is 
great  fun.  For  shooting  down these two planes  you  have  two 
different  means.  First of all you can use a machine  gun  which 
means   that  you will have to hit the enemy plane a  few  times.  
After  the  first few bullets stroke the plane  some  smoke  will 
appear  behind the plane and it will become heavier according  to 
how often you hit it. When you then finally shoot it down you can 
see the pilot bailing out.  You will have to watch that the plane 
does not crash onto your airfield because it leaves a crater  and 
you might have problems landing.  You can also remove the  crater 
by pressing the R (for Repair) key and a dozer will even out  the 
runway.  While flying about you also have to watch your own  fuel 
which  disintegrates  rather rapidly and in case you run  out  of 
fuel or your are shot down you also have the possibility to  bail 
out.  You  will then start again from your home base with  a  new 
plane,  but watch it,  you only have 5 planes. If you fly high up 
to  the clouds a space ship will appear and the aliens will  hold 
the  time and give you another life (this life is not quite  like 
all  the other lives).  After you have shot down an  enemy  plane 
either  some bonus points appear on the screen or  an  additional 
gadget for your plane like a fire extinguisher,  a spanner, turbo 
boost,  special bombs,  extra fuel (this is quite handy) and many 
other useful objects.  Whenever you land you have the possibility 
to  use the auto-pilot which usually brings you save back to  the 
ground  but  you  automatically use points.  You  can  also  land 
manually but it is rather hard, not to say impossible. 

     In  the second level you have to take off again and a  small 
arrow  at the bottom will indicate in which direction  your  next 
target  is,  while taking off do not forget to put up  your  gear 
(F10).  You  will now have to take out an enemy airfield  to  the 
east,  which means drop at least 3 bombs on the control tower. In 
order  to  drop  a bomb you have to press  the  fire  button  and 
move the joystick to the left,  for missiles press the button and 
move  the joystick to the right.  The controls for these  weapons 
are  rather inconvenient with which I mean that you drop  a  bomb 
occcasionally instead of firing a missile. 

     In  level  3  you  have to destroy  tanks  and  the  factory 
producing  them.  In future levels you have to destroy ships  and 
various other objects.  To make the game slightly harder there is 
flak.  While flying through the screen the shoot as much as  they 
can, one hit can bring you to a fatal end.

     I have been describing the game very positive so far,  which 
means that I will try to point out the negative sides now. At the 
top  I  have mentioned that the graphics are  bad,  this  is  not 
entirely true as pictures in between,  for example, when you have 
crashed you plane during an emergency landing are very nice.  The 
sound is probably the worst part of the game,  occasionally there 
is  a sampled voice which cannot be understood.  You can  hear  a 
boring tune when you press 'P' for Pause and throughout the  game 
there  is only the humming of your plane's  engine.  The  sprites 
jerk over the screen and the screen changes are very abrupt. 

     This is about all I have to say about this game,  apart from 
that I think the game play is superb providing you don't mind the 
points mentioned above. So, here is the summary:

Name                     : Skystrike +
By:                      : Atlantis
Price                    : œ6.99
Value for Money          : 7
Graphics                 : 3
Sound                    : 2
Lasting Interest         : 3.7
Programming              : 3
---------------------------------------
Overall                  : 3.74

P.S.:  The  game is written in STOS,  for that I suppose that  it 
       could have been done better, but it still is quite good.
