Guess what Mastersound 2 is? Yes that's right it's version 2 of 
Mastersound!  Mastersound originally came out about, erh... quite 
along time ago. This was a very cheap sound sampling package 
which came with hardware and only cost around œ35. Once you had 
made your samples you could assign each one to a key and then 
play them back to make a sequence file. When this was finished 
you could add a picture, a font and some text (for the scroller) 
and make your own great (ha) demo!

I had already bought Mastersound and so I only had to pay a 
tenner to upgrade to the next version. In the package I received 
a new instruction manual and the new software. If you haven't got 
Mastersound already you would have to pay œ40 for the package 
which included the sampling cartridge (You use the original 
cartridge if you owned Mastersound 1).

The first thing I noticed about MS 2 was how similar it was to 
verion 1. It looked also exactly the same. Oh well, I didn't 
mined. The thing I had been most looking forward to was sample 
quality. I had read that the sequncer could use samples of up to 
16khz. The old Mastersound could only sequence samples of 10khz. 
You are told in the manual that the best way to get really good 
samples is to take it at a very high frequencey and then squash 
it to a smaller frequencey afterwards. This is supposed to be 
better than taking a straight low frequency sample. Hang on, I 
thought, Correct me if I'm wrong but twice 16 is 32, right. MS 2 
can only take samples at a maximum of 30.7khz. Oh well, if I take 
a sample at 30.7khz and then half that, I should still have quite 
a high freqeuncy. So I take a sample at 30.7khz and half it. I 
then look for a freqeuncy which is half of 30.7 so I can play the 
sample properly. I find that there isn't one so the sample never 
sounds right. Infact the highest frequency which can be halved 
and then played properly is at 25khz, which makes the samples play 
at 12.5khz, not much better then the original Mastersound could 
do.

This is my main grumble with Mastersound 2. There is another 
thing aswell. As I have mentioned before, in Mastersound 1 you 
could make your own demos. You can on Mastersound 2 aswell but 
there is one annoying thing which it doesn't allow you to do. 
That is to have your own scrolltext! Where in MS 1 you could have 
your own scroller, in MS 2 you have to make do which a static PI1 
picture!!!!! I can't understand why this was not included in the 
new version. I thought in upgrades things were supposed to be 
improved not taken out. 

Despite these annoying factors I have to say that Mastersound 2 
is an excellent programme. You can take samples at a wide range 
of frequencys (3 to 30.7khz) and do lots of strange things with 
them. There is also a special mode for STE's. Although this is a 
very good/cheap package I do feel that it is not much of an 
improvement over the original programme. If you don't need a 
sampler straight away, I'd wait for Mastersound 3 (I hope there 
will be a third one!).
