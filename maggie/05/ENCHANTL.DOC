   I've been waiting for this game to be release for a while  now, 
and here it is. The review.....

                            STORY LINE

  Everyone is happy and peaceful in the land of Damiran.   No  one 
could  be  happier,  but of course when everything is  going  well 
something  always  go's wrong.  The heart of lore (The  source  of 
magic  wich  keeps  the land of Damiran  joyfull  and  happy)  has 
shattered into a 100 pieces (Yes 100 pieces).
   You play the role of an elderly but wise wizard called  Krugan, 
and  you've been chosen by the elders to retrieve the magic  which 
made  up the heart of lore.  This will restore life to its  normal 
happy state.   This of course isn't an easy task,  it will involve 
you fighting with bettles, spiders, fishy things and of course the 
odd mummy or two thousand.   You must use your skill and powers to 
defeat them and return home.
   Enchanted Lands is a multi directional platform game  in  which 
you must explore all six levels and capture all the lost pieces of 
magic.   You  have  to  make your way to the end  of  level  exits 
searching  all  the  areas as you go making sure  you  don't  miss 
anything.
   The landscape is made up from rocky cliffs,  grass  verges  and 
trees with many more.   Everything looks normal until you start to 
climb up a tree, you will find a whole new world of clowds, vines, 
tree  tops  and rather large flower which fire you into  the  air. 
There  are also caves and tunnels leading to hidden rooms full  of 
magic and power-ups.
  With this the game would be too easy so there are many  monsters 
all out to get you, and of course their all deadly.
   If you want to get on to get far in this game you must  collect 
all the potions you can find of which most are found in rocks  and 
trees.  As you collect more magic you can use much better weapons. 
There is a total of nine weapons,  starting at the run of the mill 
blipp to the smash bomb.   You can make all of these all the  more 
powerful  by  mixing potions at the end of each level  before  you 
fight the end of level beasty.

                         FIRST IMPRESSION

   My first words when I saw Enchanted Lands were  "bloody  hell", 
yes Thalion have done it once again.   The scrolling is as  smooth 
as a babies bottom and the graphics and music are just superb, the 
style  of  the game is just THALION there no one  else  who  could 
move  almost the entire screen and it's not just horizontal but  8 
directional   (Steve  Bak said it couldn't be done on an ST  in  a 
game but he was so wrong).   The scrolling adds to the whole game, 
making  the  feel  just  like the arcade  with  a  sence  of  free 
movement.  To make the game more colourful they have added rasters 
(coloured line to you) in the background to make it look just that 
bit better.  The music is soundchip generated but like all Thalion 
games  makes the most of it using it to its  full  potential.  The 
grafix and animation are faultless as to is the scrolling.

                             LAST WORD


  Enchanted Lands is one of the most addictive games I played for 
years, if it was a drug it would be banned. Game play is fast with 
plenty  of fire bashing and it's great to be able to  jump  around 
the screen because it so smooth and fast.

  GRAPHICS  99.9% 

 Animation and end of level monsters are exelently drawn.

  MUSIC     98%

 The soundtrack is superb and is not too repetative.

  EFFECTS   100%

 I just can't see how they can be any better than they are.

  PLAYABILITY 95%

 First class action with virtually no fault.

  LONG TERM INTEREST  90%

 The only way to stop me playing is to write a game better, if its 
possable.


 All I can say is buy it!!!!!!
