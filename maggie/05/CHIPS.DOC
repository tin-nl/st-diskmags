              -Fish 'n' Chips Demo by Sewer Software-
              ---------------------------------------
                                   Reviewed by Michael Schuessler

     Well,  here we are again, this time with a demo from far far 
away. strange enough this demo isnot from one of the famous crews 
from  Europebut  is  from  a famous crew  from  the  Aussi  Land, 
Australia.

     The demo is made consists of 17 different screens  including 
the loader picture and the reset demo.  The first impression that 
I  had of the demo was a rather good one but there are a few  bad 
points  which are definitely worth mentioning.  Like for  example 
when  I examined the demo it crashed 4 times and I always had  to 
reboot. The problem always occurred when I wanted to enter one of 
the screens the demo bombed out with a full row of bombs. 
     
     So first of all there is a picture of a fish which is sliced 
open  and its organs are made up of circuit  boards.  Above  some 
text  tells you the name of the demo.  The graffix on the  screen 
are very nice but are still going to get a lot better on some  of 
the other screens. 

The Loader:
-----------
     The loader is quite funny as there is a disc with a pair  of 
legs  and  a head sticking out from beneath it.  After  the  disc 
drive light goes off the disc changes to a processor. A scrolline 
at  the bottom of the screen gives you some information  on  what 
you are about to experience.

The Intro:
----------
     The  graffix  on this screen I am not  too  impressed  with, 
rather disapointed in fact 'cause they a sh.t in comparison  with 
the ones before. Anyway, the is a flipping bouncing Sewer logo at 
the top and a scroller also scrolls about somewhere. These Aussis 
must  have  got pissed off with the boring Atari  ST  Sound  Chip 
musix because the tune of a 4 track player fills the room.

The Main Menu:
--------------
     Another 4 track fills the room before the screen appears but 
when it appears you can see some scruffy looking dude sitting  on 
a  platform and fishing.  Two cursor keys on either side  of  the 
screen  indicate  that  you can scroll up and down  in  order  to 
select  the various screens.  Always after you have selected  one 
something  happens  to  the  guy like  for  example  a  flash  of 
lightening splits the man's head apart, shit dribbles down on his 
head,  a  rope is lowered in from the top and pulls his head  off 
and  many many other things also happen.  The animation is  quite 
well done.

The Vector Demo:
----------------
     I  would  say that the name gives the screen away  but  then 
again that is not too bad is it ?  Most of the screen is occupied 
by  the  vectors which keep on flying around and  for  some  more 
information on the screen there is some text at the bottom  which 
changes   occasionally.   In  order  to  make  the  screen   more 
interesting the colours of the vectors change here and there.

Tech Tron Demo 2:
-----------------
     This  kind of screen is well known from the So Watt Demo  by 
the Carebears.  A few one plane layers,  in this case two, scroll 
up  and  down or left and right,  scrollers going  up,  a  larger 
scroller at the bottom of the screen and to top it off there  are 
some sprites saying TLB.  Screens like this are rather  confusing 
and become boring after a while.

Big Fish Demo:
--------------
     This  is  the  screen I meant when I  was  saying  that  the 
graffix are going to become better. Well there are two fish heads 
and a snake twirled around something bouncing up and down. That's 
about  all  for that screen apart from a naff starfield  and  the 
usual scroller. Apart from the graffix this screen is very boring 
and I stress the word boring.

Paralax:
--------
     This  screen is an answer to the Paralax Screen by the  Lost 
Boys in the Mindbomb.  Sewer Software are pround to say that they 
can  change the graffix on the 2 layers scrolling around.  A  few 
more  scrollers  make their way upwards and one  other  scrollers 
moves sideways.

Megascroll:
-----------
     Beware,   another  screen  which  is  rather   boring.   The 
background  is  moving  and wobbling upwards  along  with  a  big 
scroller scrolling over the screen.

Acid Demo:
----------
     Acccccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiiiidddd.   Acid  faces  flashing,  a 
scroller,  loadsa flashing colours and of course the groovy  acid 
sample.  This  screen appears to be a straight copy of  An  Cools 
Acid  Demo which was coded quite a while back and An  Cools  demo 
was even better as the sample was longer and the quality  better. 
But  in  this  case  you have to  remember  that  Sewer  Software 
probably had difficulty with the disc space.  All in all I  quite 
like this screen nevertheless.

The VU Screen:
--------------
     The usual things are again represented in this screen  which 
are:  a scroller,  bad colour bars and a wobbling logo.  The only 
thing  which I could find slightly amusing about the  screen  are 
the  volume indicators which are made of 2 dragon's head and  the 
sewer logo.  The heads keep turning around in time to the  musix. 
Apart  from that the screen is again quite boring and could  have 
probably been written by TEX a long long time agao.

Sprite Manic:
-------------
     65  (not  that I counted them) fully  masked  32*32  sprites 
along with a horizontal scroller and a few moving  upwards.  This 
is quite a nice screen I think.

Crystal Scroller:
-----------------
     It has probably been at least a year now since I have seen a 
crystal scroller in a demo,  it's rather old fashioned don't  you 
think but then again I rather like it, I suppose it reminds me of 
the good old days. So there is a big crystal scroller on top of a 
wobbling  background which moves up and up and up  and  up...  To 
make  the screen somewhat more interesting they have  included  a 
strange sample.

Music Demo:
-----------
     You  can  choose  you tune out of 11  different  ones  which 
scroll around a tube.  On the screen there are also three  volume 
indicators which are all the same. A pretty boring screen, even I 
could code it and that means quite a lot.

Pixel Perfection:
-----------------
     A  3D wireframe without the frame as the scroller  lets  you 
know.  In other words there are lodsa dots on the screen  forming 
various objects.  From time to time some graffix fade in and  out 
in the background.

The Exit Screen:
----------------
     This is the last screen of this mega demo.  It is  basically 
the credits and the greetings.  At the top there is another Sewer 
logo  wobbling and by hitting the cursor keys you can  scroll  up 
and  down  in the greetings.  Thanks for the Lost  Boys  greeting 
guys! 

Reset:
------
     When you are finally fed up looking at this demo and you hit 
the  reset  button  a  picture of  fastcopy  appears  and  starts 
formatting  you disc so leave it write protected!  Quite  a  nice 
idea really although it doesn't really format your disc.

     This is it now.  My final remark to this demo would be  that 
it  is nowhere near the best but it still is a big demo  and  has 
some  nice screens and is therefore definitely worth to  go  into 
your collection.

Overall                       : 7.4

     From  my  point of view I have giving the  demo  quite  good 
marks  although they could have been better if  their  programmer 
would  have  done  more better screens.  The  same  is  with  the 
graffix,  if  they all were as good as the fish  heads  etc..  he 
might have got 9.5 or something similar.
