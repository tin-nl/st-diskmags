                  THE NEW LEADER OF THE STEs
                  --------------------------

We all heard about this new powerfull machine called MEGA STE  so 
I  want to inform you about the things Atari has  installed.  The 
MEGA  STE contains a 68000 CPU and a 16 KByte  cache-memory  both 
working with 16 MHz frequenz.  Next to this the user is also able 
to build in a Floating Point Unit which will help the CPU  during 
it's  tremendous calculations.  When activating the MEGA STE  you 
find the Atari TT desktop containing the same functions as moving 
folders and files onto the desktop.  Next to these new  functions 
you  can also deactivate the cache and slow down the CPU (16  MHz 
or 8 MHz for special ST software and games!).
The processor operations are about two times faster than the  ST 
and while using external memory the MEGA STE is about 150 percent 
faster.  This is caused by the fact that the MEGA STE uses only 8 
MHz to communicate with the RAMS. Atari Germany presents this new 
machine  containing 4 MByte RAM and 48 MByte  harddisk.  Next  to 
this  you get a VMEbus-conection and a LAN (Local  Area  Network) 
conection.

When  thinking  of these facts the MEGA STE seems to  be  a  well 
created   and  fast  machine  which  might  also  be   used   for 
professional  work.  Theirs  only the 720 KByte  diskdrive  which 
should  be replaced by a 1.44 MByte drive.  Also the MEGA ST  bus 
and the SCSI-conection are missing. The user has to decide wether 
the MEGA STE will enter the Atari world or not ......
