 INTERSTING INFO


    I have just been cajoled and bribed into writting this idiotic 
document about two of my casual aquantainces who I have never  met 
before in my life, Ashley Cook and Oliver Greensmith.
    The first thing that you are bouynd to notice about these  two 
dildo's  is  what bloody silly names they  have.  I  mean,  Oliver 
sounds more like an oriental fruit than a name,  and A Cook - Well 
that speaks for itself doesn't it.
    If you have never actually met either of these dudes  then  I 
warn you - don't attempt to make contact.
    Well,  now for some important information about these two. Let 
us begin with Ashley.
    Ashley is a great conversationalist.  He often comes out  with 
some really profound statements,  well at least he comes out  with 
half  of  a really profound statement,  forgets the  rest  of  it, 
stops, and throws a couple of insults around instead. His brain is 
like a sieve and his mouth is like a sewer.
    Oli (as he calls himself) is worse, at least Ashley gets half-
way through a sentence.  Oli's idea of conversation is a stream of 
randomly  selected words which make little sense even to  himself. 
His language is even worse than Ashley's although he is much  less 
insulting and is a lot more reliable.
    Quote from recent conversation :

ASHLEY - What's one of those things with humps called again ?
OLI    - Wot, a camel.
ME     - Insane laughter at Ashley
ASHLEY - Duh.... Wots up ?? !!

    I have never visited Oli's home,  but I suspect that he has  a 
rather  strange family life - He has just given Ashley 16  recipes 
for scottish salmon as donated by his father - odd hey ?
    Ashley lives with his parents and many siblings (brothers  and 
sisters to you,  dude) but rarely see's them as he spends most  of 
his  time in his bedroom which is decorated by the empty boxes  of 
Crawfords  mini cookies which are pinned to walls and  ceiling  at 
strategic  points  in a manner rather reminiscent  of  the  Fluffy 
things which invade the screen when playing elite (at least on the 
old C64 version). Other items to be found here include :
  a keyboard (musical),  2 Atari ST's, 1 EVS-1, an  RS232 terminal,
  a printer, lots of disky drives a T.V or 3 and lots of other junk 
  which  is strewed  about  in a most  unorganized  fasion  and is 
  connected together by a spiders web of multicoloured (colored  ?) 
cables.
 

                                              SQUIRT & OLI .
