                              from
     - THE LOST SLAUGHTER ZOMBIE CARECOWS FROM OUTER SPACE -
       gives you his judgement about the "european demos"
              (TANICK MADKIN: what a nice fellow!)
              ("european demos": what a bad demo!)


So, I - Tanick Madkin - am here to review a demo called "european 
demos", mainly by the OVARLENDERS.
But before testing this crap stuff, I would like to say that I'm 
soon going to release my own demo, called "THE FOCKIN' BEST DEMO" 
which will be the best demo so far on Atari ST. You'll find a 
preview of one of my screen on the disk, called "GLORY TANICK 
MADKIN DEMO" (Note to TLB: include it or I shall give you some 
f..k in my scrolltexts!).
By the way: I you want to get my demo as soon as it is released, 
send me 25$ or 20œ (send it directly to TLB since I cannot give 
my personnal address or I guess I would have to create a fan 
club). Now, I think I could stop writing but I know that lots of 
people love reading text by me (don't worry, one of my scrolltext 
will be over 210 Kb and will tell my whole life from my sixth 
year to nowadays).
So, I'll continue a bit and say a few words about the "european 
demos" by ROVERLAMERS.

Mainly, what I have to tell you is that this is a BAD demo.

First, it's on two disks. And I don't like to use two disks for a 
demo. Of course, there's a letter on each demo door to indicate 
on which disk the demo stands but, anyway, this is no excuse.

Then, there are no PRG on the disk and you cannot have a look at 
them (no easy ripping, too bad). And some cartrigde do not work 
with it (such as the ULTIMATE RIPPER). Too bad...

The demo-introduction is quite long and not very interesting. I 
reckon it lacks animations or good graphix. The music is crap 
(even worse than MAD MAX!). No good...

The loader, by Mr Bee, is one of the worst I've ever seen!
Bad colors, sad fonts, sluggish 3D... Nasty!
Same thing for the disk-screen, with a small 3D disk (it seems 
that these guys do not even use hidden-faces algorythms!).

The main menu is bad and ugly. You move a little boy (or is it a 
girl?) around, choosing a door with a demo behind. It is in 
fullscreen and I don't like it. The graphix are bad, the muzak 
has no digisound, there are no enemies to fight and the character 
animations are too fast and look generally pitifull.
I never made such a main menu but I'm sure it's easy to do 
better... (have a look at my coding skills in the "GLORY TANICK 
MADKIN DEMO"). The map is badly designed (you cannot go where you 
want), you cannot use joystick or mouse and the scrolltext is 
badly written (by a froggy, of course!). I don't like this main 
menu, it's no worth saying more about it...

There are something like twenty screens in the "european demos" 
but most of them are unsignificant. There's nothing original in 
this demo! Only big sprites, bytebenders, megascrollers and 
soundtrack muzax. Nothing interesting, I guess. Hopefully, my 
demo, the "FOCKIN' BEST DEMO", will change this matter of fact 
(just send me 25$ or 20œ to get it, free of charge).

Well, I guess that my fans would like me to write some more words 
so I'm going to give you details about some screens of this demo, 
anyway (even if they're crap, as I told you).
Ok. But quickly...

- Vector 1: This screen isn't very good. Just a DNA scroller, a 
big meltin' and jerkin' logo and some ballsprites. No good.

- Vectro 2: Guess what? As bad as the first one. A slow 
3 bitplanes bytebending scroller (I prefer fast 1-bitplane 
straight scroller, better to read) and a disting logo with a 
raster background (ugly colors!).

- The Corporation: Nothing good. A fullscreen with tiles and a 
scroller. I can do it in ST BASIC! Are they joking or what?

- Future Minds: Bad graphix. Some little balls, a fast straight 
scroller (but in fullscreen, I don't like scrollers in fullscreen 
'coz you cannot read what is written in the border) and a logo 
growing. The only things that are decent are the two 25Hz 
small vertical scrollers. But this demo is crap, anyway.

- Newline: Berk. Very few sprites on a moving background with a 
giant scroller and a moving alliance logo. Ugly, badly coded. 
Nothing good in it!

- Pendragons 1: a 3D ball (very few dots), some unreadable DNA 
scrollers and a bad "roller" effect. These froggies deliver the 
BAD thing once again (but the ODERVALNERS are even worse!).

- Prendogans 2: a fullscreen with unlimited amount of sprites.
What's the interest of making fullscreen? Ok, there are lotsa 
sprites but they're quite small. So, it's easy. I don't think 
this screen is good. To say the truth: it's bad!

- Gudul: Some moving HBLs? Pfuuu... easy! And there's also a 
scroller (in fullscreen, I hate that!). Some dots are used to 
write some stupid texts but it's too slow. No good (I told you 
this was a crappy demo. You'd better order the "FOCKIN' BEST 
DEMO" from me - only 25$ or 20œ -).

- Hemorroids: just a big scroller in fullscreen with some 
parallax background and soundtrack music. Not very good. I don't 
like this screen.

- NeXT: at the beginning, I thought this could be a good screen. 
There was a very clean and fast white scroller at the botton of 
the screen. But all this was wasted by some moving background, 
ugly rasters, nasty sprites, wobbling logo and ear-killing 
soundtrack muzak... Too bad! NeXT were better before...

- Silvers: a big scroller with equalizers and the ugly faces of 
the Silvers members fading at the bottom of the screen. The 
scroller is in three different language but I don't like reading 
scrolltext (except mine). Nothing worth in this demo.

- New Power Generation: Aie, aie, aie! Caramba! Is it a demo or a 
shit? The graphix are ugly, the muzak is savagely bad and there 
are no real animations... If I ever code such a thing, I guess I 
would commit suicide then...

- Genesis: just a circle scroller with a moving background on the 
whole screen. The graphix are ugly and I don't like controlable 
scrollers (with the cursor keys but I advise you not to use 
them). Genesis actually need to improve!

- Blue Bird: Bah! It's really ugly! Even without my special 
glasses, I could do better graphix. And this big scroller is very 
bad (too slow!). There are also white logos but they're not very 
good either.

- The Voyagers: Ok, the graphix are not too bad. It was my graphic 
level two years ago (but I'm really better now!). Of course, 
there's a scroller and some black sprites but I reckon this 
screen lacks originality and is, sort of, a "muddle". I don't 
like this kind of demos...

- Alien Cracking Formation: some balls, a rotating starfield and 
two scrollers... Too much things on the screen! More, one of this 
scrollines is bending! Hey, guys, have a look at my demo. You'll 
see that simplicity often gives the best results!

- Oversalbern 1: a bad soundtrack muzik with some slow vector 
graphix grid-equalizers. Add it some stars and a moving logo and 
you'll have the idea of how crap this screen is... Just listen to 
MY soundtrack music and you'll immediately notice the difference.

- Avrelonders 2: two different megascrollers, in fullscreen. But 
when will they stop doing fullscreens?! This two megascrollers 
are very bad coded (you'll see what a big scroller can be in the 
"FOCKIN' BEST DEMO"). The guy who made that, Mr Bee, should flush 
himself in the toilets!

- Ouverlaners 3: God! How ugly it is! And absolutely nothing 
original! It's merely a giant green sprite (higher than the 
screen - it's a fullscreen, of course! -) and some bad letter 
scrolling behind it. All this with nasty classical raster 
effects. No good in this screen (DIM, the poor coder!).

- Landerovers 4: What? Some big sprites in fullscreen! With a 
moving dot-cube in the background? It would not be too bad if 
there wasn't such a bad soundtrack "music" (does it deserve the 
name of music?) and a giant scroller. And it's, once again, a 
fullscreen! Of course, two programmers had to code together to 
rip the code for this demo (Ziggo and Adsy, I think).

- Avorlenders 5: This is supposed to be a 3D filled vector demo!
What a joke! Ok, the vector are smooth but the objects are very 
simple and there's no background behind them! Too easy! And the 
various objets are not animated and not very colorful... Just 
wait for the "FOCKIN' BEST DEMO" and you'll see what a real 3D 
demo must look like!

The reset demo is even worse. When you press reset to quit and 
see a better demo (for instance, have a look at my preview - 
"GLORY TANICK MADKIN DEMO" - on the disk), you get a bad Donald 
Duck picture and then, some moving dots on the screen. That's 
all... and that's not what I'd call a decent reset demo!

Wow! I think it's finished, at last! Well, for all my fans, 
there's my last advice:
If someone send you the "european demos", send me the two disks 
all along with 25$ or 20œ. If I find enough time, I'll send you 
back one of the disk (the worse one) with the "FOCKIN' BEST DEMO" 
on it and the other one will help me to improve my disk 
collection. And I promise I won't fuck you in my greeting list! 
Sounds good, no? I know it's very generous from me but I think 
that when you're as good as I am, you can do something to help 
small other guys.

So, it's finished right now! I hope to get your money soon and be 
patient: the "FOCKIN' BEST DEMO" of TANICK MADKIN from TLSZCFOS 
is coming soon (you can already send some donations for the 
preview spreaded in MAGGIE).
