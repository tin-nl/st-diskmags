A review by Leon O'Reilly

     Dino Dini,  genius or dog food?  This is the question on  the 
nations' lips.  Well  the  answer  is  he's  a  scattered  brained 
scientist from the planet alpha centauri.
     Kick Off was a masterpiece,  a modern classic and I'm pleased 
to say that Kick Off 2 is an improvement on the old formula.
     There are to my knowledge at least three versions of Kick Off 
2,  one without the World Cup, one with the world cup (My version) 
and the new version on a double sided disk with a loading screen!!
     I  have  the version on a single-sided disk with  no  loading 
screen  (Sob!).  It takes 1.05 minutes to load,  then up pops  the 
opening screen.
     You  then see the infamous Kick Off 2 logo and are told  that 
the  program  is by Dino Dini and graphics are by  Steve  Screech. 
Along a line on the bottom it say (C) Anco Software LTD though  on 
my  Amiga  owning  friends computer this  line  reads  Cracked  by 
Oracle.  This screen also tells me I have version 1.2e of Kick Off 
2.
     Before  we  start this in-depth review,  lets see  what  Anco 
themselves have to say about their favourite game:
     "Kick Off 2 retains the pace and accuracy of the  universally 
acclaimed  Kick Off.  A soccer simulation with full  size   multi- 
directional scrolling pitch and the players,  markings, goals etc. 
in  correct  proportions.   both  teams  play  the  game  strictly 
according to tactics. Players move into position to receive passes 
and gain possession.  The ball, as in the real game, travels ahead 
of  the player thus making a tackle a matter of skill rather  than 
chance.
     "Kick Off 2 like real soccer, requires skills in ball control 
for passing,  dribbling,  shooting etc.  Accuracy in shooting, the 
ability  to  swerve  or bend the ball need a  lot  of  skill.  the 
practice  option  allows you to practice the ball  skills  without 
being harassed by the opposition.  Take your time and practice the 
skills  to perfection.  If two players are to team up,  it  is  an 
ideal opportunity to practice ONE - TWO up and down the pitch.
     "Each  player on the pitch has a (surely it should be  'an'?) 
unique combination of attributes and skills suitable for the skill 
level  at  which the game is being  played.  An  international  is 
superior to 4th division player in all departments.
     "A  host  of playing options are provided.  One of  the  most 
useful  is  the provision to set the skill levels  of  both  teams 
independently.  A novice with INT.  squad can give a  professional 
with 4th division squad a run for his money.
     "There  is  a  league and cup tournament  with  sudden  death 
penalty shoot outs in case of a draw.  The teams in the league are 
on the whole evenly matched but with different styles of play  and 
the player skills to match that style.  There is an option to load 
your own team from Player Manager along with your own tactics you 
play against another Player Manager team in a single game or enter 
a League and Cup tournament.
     
     Anyroad,  back to the story.  Past the opening screen is what 
might be termed as a main menu. You have nine sub-menus accessible 
with your joystick:
    _____________________________________________
    |PRACTICE______|__SINGLE_GAME_|_THE LEAGUE___|_____
    ÿÿÿÿÿ|THE CUP_______|ÿINTÿFRIENDLY_|ÿACTION_REPLAY|____
         ÿÿÿÿÿ|KIT DESIGNÿÿÿÿ|ÿÿÿOPTIONSÿÿÿÿ|ÿSPECIAL EVENT|
              ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
     Lets  start by trying practice.  Selecting this option  takes 
you  to  the team selection screen,  but first you have  to  choose 
whether you want 1 or 2 players (On the same team) and whether you 
want to kick up or down the pitch.
     Then you are presented with a list of 23 players.  You  click 
on  a number from 1 to 14 and a player to put that player in  that 
position. Pressing 1 to 4 switches between the tactics:
4-2-4, 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 5-3-2
     If you place a little J1 symbol by a player,  this means  you 
control him during the game and the computer controls the rest  of 
the team.
     A roar,which sounds like my stomach after three hours with no 
food, greets the team as they stroll out onto the pitch. They move 
into position. The whistle blows and it Kick Off time! 
     On  practice  you can try your hand (or  foot!)  at  passing, 
shooting,  chipping,  curling,  throw ins, corners and goal kicks. 
you can't practice tackles or free kicks nor penalties.  This is a 
let down, even Kick Off 1 allowed you to practice penalties.
     I  suggest the first thing anyone who buys this game does  is 
try practice,  KO2 is very hard to master. If you're used to games 
where the ball 'glues' to your foot,  like Matchday 2,  you're  in 
for a shock!
     OPTIONS  is the most used screen,  everytime I load  KO2  the 
first  menu I go to is the options menu,  well sometimes I  forget 
then have to quit the game because the settings are wrong.
     The options are:
PITCH - Normal /  Wet / Soggy / Plastic / Random
I always select normal. Wet increases ball travel and speed. Soggy 
reduces ball bounce and players' stamina.  Plastic makes you  feel 
like you're playing for Luton (Yuk!) (I was going to say  'Shit!', 
but this is a family article).
DURATION - 2 X 3  /  2 X 5  / 2 X 10  / 2 X 20
I  wish  KO2 retained the feature of a full length 2 X  45  minute 
match like KO1. If I'm playing league or cup I usually have 3 or 5 
minute halves. If I'm playing a single game I have 10 or 20 minute 
halves depending how long is left before Coronation Street starts.
WIND - This isn't to do with how often the players fart.  You have 
4 settings - Off / Light / Medium / Strong
I always put wind off,  it makes the game very hard with the  ball 
blowing away from you as you run.
EXTRA TIME -  No  /  Yes
I put ET on as penalties are fun and I score at least 80% of them!
Basically  what happens with E.T.  is that if a match is drawn  in 
after  full time then two shorter halves are played.  If score  is 
still level after this then it goes to penalties.  Each team has 5 
penalty attempts.  If score is still level it goes to sudden death 
penalties,  if one team misses and the other scores,  the  scorers 
are through!
AFTER TOUCH -  No  /  Yes
I ALWAYS put A.T. on as the goalkeeper are more intelligent in KO2 
and  it often take a bit of curl to beat them.  I can't play  with 
A.T. off!
LEAGUE SKILL -  International  / Division 1  / Division 3
I  keep  this on International,  but then again I am ace  at  this 
game!
GAME SPEED -  Normal  /  50%  /  25%
If the game runs too fast for all you lamers out there,  then  you 
can slow it down to Spectrum or Amiga speed.  You don't get action 
replay at these speeds.
SKILL LEVEL -  Team A  / Team B
You can pick one of 5 skill levels,  International,  Division One, 
division two, division three, division four and Player Manager.
Obviously International players are better all round than division 
four  players.  Then difference between each skill level is a  lot 
less  than it was in Kick Off 1 though,  so it is possible  for  a 
good  player  (Me!)  with a fourth division team to  beat  a  crap 
player (My sister!) with an International team.
The  Player  Manager option allows you to load in a  team  created 
with PM,  so you can have G.A.Rose and company playing in Kick Off 
2.
SELECT TACTICS -  Team A  /  Team B
As well as the conventional 4-2-4,  4-3-3,  4-4-2,  5-3-2 you also 
have the option of the more radical 'Balanced',  'Blitz', 'Falcon' 
or 'Lockout'.
REFEREE - Random / Not so random
You can either let the computer pick a referee or pick one of  the 
decrepit old blind bastards yourself. 

KIT DESIGN
Now it time to let loose the Van Goghs of the football world,  can 
you  design a kit as hideous as Sheffield United's  one.  You  can 
change the kit designs for the ten team - eight international  and 
team a & team b. On each kit there a two colours that you can pick 
from an available twenty.  The patterns you can choose are  either 
blank,  striped,  bands,  coloured  sleeves,  halves and  diagonal 
stripe.

SINGLE GAME
On  this  you  can  have  one to  four  player  in  a  variety  of 
combinations:
1 Player - Plays as team or plays in position
2 Players - They  can play in team mode,  both in position in  the 
same team against the computer.  They can play against each other, 
each  being a team.  One or both of them can play in  position  in 
their team.
3 Players - Players 1 and 3 play in position in team mode.  Player 
2  is  the  other team,  and he can either play as a  team  or  in 
position.
4 Players - Players 1 and 3 play in position in team mode  against 
player 2 and 4 who also play in position in team mode.

After  you've  picked your players you are  shown  an  information 
screen.  This shows the kits of team A & B, tells you which bod is 
todays' referee,  the wind direction and relevant velocity, which 
team  has won the toss - if you win you can choose to kick  up  or 
down  the pitch.  If you want to save your goals,  pick the  store 
option. Make up a filename for this match, type in the date, names 
of the teams and the players.
When the match starts you here the sound of a deflating balloon and 
the sprites come out of an invisible tunnel.  There is less sprite 
clash on KO2 than KO1,  but it is still there. In the bottom right 
hand corner of the screen is the score,  in the top left corner is 
a  scanner showing the positions of all the players on the  pitch. 
You  can shrink or enlarger the scanner to make it less  obtrusive 
or more functional.  In the bottom middle of the screen is a timer 
showing you how long is left in the half.
The  pitch is made up of a series of light and dark green  stripes 
with  white  lines making up the markings.  There is  four  border 
overscan, sort of. The green stripes seep into the border, but the 
players  and  markings  don't appear in the  border.  This  is  an 
improvement  over the Amiga version which only features  3  border 
overscan!
MOVEMENT
This is the complicated bit.  Moving the joystick in one of  eight 
directions moves the player in the relevant direction.  If he  has 
the  ball  he will dribble with it.  If the ball is  in  the  air, 
pressing  fire with make the player attempt a header.  If you  are 
touching the ball and you press fire you will shoot the  ball.  To 
trap  the ball you must press and hold down fire  before  touching 
the  ball.  When  you  let go of fire you pass  the  pass  in  the 
direction you are facing.  To chip the ball,  move in the opposite 
direction to your original direction of travel when you touch  the 
ball.  After touch is the most important feature amongst  strikers 
especially.
Tackling is a risky proposition.  If you have a strong player  you 
can  run  'through' the player with the ball to  gain  possession. 
Sliding  tackles are very dangerous.  If you haven't got the  ball 
and  you move in a direction while pressing fire you  will  tackle 
anything  in your path,  if you tackle them behind this is a  foul 
and the referee will penalise you. (Oooo-eerrr!) 
Joystick directions:

                                1       
                             8     2     
                          7     0     3       
                             6     4     
                                5       

Goal kicks are taken automatically unless you push the joystick in 
your  chosen direction and press fire.  This is what pushing  each 
direction does:
0 - Medium ahead
1 - Hard ahead
2 - Hard right
3 - Medium right
4 - Soft right
5 - Soft ahead
6 - Soft left
7 - Medium left
8 - Hard left

When attempting to save a penalty,  move in a direction and  press 
fire. The longer you press fire the bigger the movement:
0 - Catch ball
1 - Jump up
2 - Dive top right corner
3 - Dive right mid bar height
4 - Drive right ground
5 - Stoop
6 - Dive left mid bar height
7 - Dive left mid bar height
8 - Dive top left corner

CORNERS
Press  joystick in direction and press fire.  The longer you  hold 
down fire the stronger the corner kick. The ball travels:
0 - Middle straight
1 - Low straight
2 - Low curl in towards the goal
3 - Mid height towards goal
4 - High curl towards goal
5 - High straight
6 - High curl away from goal
7 - Mid height away from goal
8 - Low curl away from goal

FREE KICKS
These  take  a bit of getting used to as  they're  quite  complex. 
Press fire to start the run, the longer you press fire, the higher 
the  ball will go.  You move the joystick twice,  once before  the 
player touches the ball and once after.
Before:
0 - Straight kick
1 - Jump over the ball
2 - Slight right bias
3 - More right bias
4 - Pass ball to right player
5 - No action
6 - Pass ball to left player
7 - More left bias
8 - Slight left bias

After:
0 - No action
1 - Dip the ball
2 - Dip and swerve ball
3 - Swerve ball
4 - No action
5 - No action
6 - No action
7 - Swerve ball
8 - Dip and swerve ball

THE LEAGUE
This has three setting, International, Division 1 and Division 3.
You pick from the following International teams:
Holland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Scotland & Spain.
My favourite team is France,  they have the excellent I.  Edwards, 
as well the skilful D. Payne & F.T.B. Sinclair and also the great 
defender G.N. Clarke.
The main screen is a league table showing each team, the number of 
games they've played,  Won,  drawn, lost, goals for, goals against 
and points.
You  choose  if  you  want  the teams  to  be  computer  or  human 
controlled, so you can play on your own or with eight 'friends'.
The league is played over 14 weeks,  so you play each team  twice. 
League  can be saved and loaded so you don't have to play  all  14 
teams in one go.

THE CUP
This  contains the eight international teams,  and is played  over 
three  weeks,  starting in the quarter-final,  going  through  the 
semi-final and finishing with the final.
With  only three games this isn't much of a cup,  and it  is  very 
tacky.  No  records are kept of the scores and the screen  display 
doesn't change throughout the tournament.  All that happens if you 
win  the Cup is that a star appears by your team.  Hardly a  major 
prize.

INTERNATIONAL FRIENDLY
You  pick  two  teams to play against each other  from  the  eight 
available.  This  game is for 1 to 4 players.  My ratings  of  the 
teams (And a coding team to represent each country):
1. France (Overlanders)
2. England(The Lost Boys)
3. Sweden (The Carebears)
4. Spain  (Paulo Simoes-sort of)
5. Germany (Tex)
6. Scotland(Fingerbobs)
7. Holland (Aenigmatica)
8. Italy   (Spaghetti crew)

ACTION REPLAY
Using  this you watch and re-watch your moments of  glory.  Create 
diskfulls  of  golden goals and bore your friends by  showing  and 
reshowing all your 'nettings'!

SPECIAL EVENT
The one included on my version of KO2 was the World Cup.  The best 
thing  about  this is the picture of the flags  of  the  competing 
countries.  It is arranged slightly better than the standard  cup, 
but  not much.  You get tables for all the world cup  groups,  but 
again  the winner gets no special screens proclaiming his  worldly 
domination.


     Overall - wow! I got Kick Off last Christmas, and I played it 
every  day for the first four months,  then I played it  at  least 
three  times a week.  I got Kick Off 2 in August and it is a  very 
rare day indeed in which I don't have a game.
     The graphics and sound are naff but, smarmy Amiga owners take 
note, graphics don't make a game and sound is even less important. 
This  game  oozes  playability.  It  is  amazingly  good  fun  and 
extremely satisfying.  Playing solo is great and playing against a 
friend is unbelievable. It is worth buying an ST just to play Kick 
Off 2 and that is the greatest complement I can give it.
