         ~~~~~~~~~ CHRIS'S HIDDEN ARTICLE BIT ~~~~~~~~
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WHEEEEEE!!!! You can tell I'm shit outta ideas, can't you!!!

I've just been moving the title or 'masthead' bit a few spaces  to 
the  right  whilst  the  brain  starts  working  again.   This  is 
impossible  of course,  as the brain has long since been dissolved 
by drink!!

This  is the hidden article you are reading,  congratulations  for 
getting  this  far,  if so,  you will probably be A) German,  B) A 
member  of  the  Union,  C)  Fluent in  both  English  and  German 
languages, or D) Extremely lucky, the Hidden Article Quest is like 
the Lamertest (TM) with balls (Testicles, not 3-D bitmaps) and you 
have to be brilliant (or cheat like buggery..) to get through..

This  issue of MAGGIE has contributions for the hidden article  by 
most  of the regular writers,  normal service will resume  shortly 
(Whatever passes for normal around here, I've forgotten myself...) 
But  in the meantime,  here's some freefall wibble to be going  on 
with....

  I SEE BELOW ME AN INFINITE MILKY WHITENESS STRETCHING AWAY  INTO 
 THE DISTANCE,  I AM HANGING ON TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PARAGRAPH BUT

A quick paragraph..               A       The other side..

Whatever happened to              A   Hi there, this is the
The Carebears???                     the other side of the 
We were told to expect            A  page, I am going to do a
about a year ago, a new              quick spot for Syncron
megademo, which was               A  Assembly's AUDIO SCULPTURE
'pencilled in' for                   soundtracker, it will be 
around Xmas time last             A  available from MPH who do
year... It has not                   the TCB Tracker for œ44.95
appeared and it seems             A  at the end of April (so 
to this writer that                  they tell me..) and will
they are keeping their            A  probably be the most 
promise of no more new               fully-featured soundtracker
demos.. It is also very           A  on the ST to date....
strange that they have               (so they tell me.....)
several new members and           A  expect a full review in here
there has not been a                 soon........
scrap of work since then          A
It now seems that they are
due another 'Bear battering'      A
from another well-known Crew
not a million miles away from     A
the production of this             
publication in their 
forthcoming new demo.             A
We all loved the 'Cuddly Demo'
but it is now 1991, are TCB       G

                WELL  THAT WAS A VERY HARD BASTARD  OF  A  LANDING                   
                WASN'T IT

  LET US LIE HERE AWHILE,  AS I THINK THIS IS A BIT PAINFUL TO SAY 
  THE LEAST, FOR A START, MY LEFT LEG IS MISSING....

  >no it isn't mate, it's over there ---->LEFT LEG
 
  THANK  YOU,  YOU  ARE VERY KIND FOR SOMEONE WITH NO  UPPER  CASE 
  LETTERS TO HIS NAME.....

  >that's ok pal, anytime.......

  ANYWAY, WHERE WAS I, OH YEAH!!!!
                                  A
                                  A
                                  A
                                  AGGHH!!
                                (ETC..)

  Now drawing a veil over this sad attempt to be clever  and  fill 
space, I understand that the other function of the Hidden Article 
in  Maggie  is for some of the TOO CONTROVERSIAL TO  PUT  ANYWHERE 
ELSE articles, such as...

  STORY:-  "One day,  Nobby and the Emperor Caligula,  and his pet 
horse, got together in the leafy glade for some really heavy sado-
masochistic rituals involving birch twigs,  tinned peaches,  and a 
combine harvester. Firstly, they xxxxxxxxxxxx CENSORED xxxxxxxx
  xxxxxxx do it roughly,  he cried..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx spreading  the 
custard evenly xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Remember AN COOL!!  he cried 
at  the height of his xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Thank  you!  whinnied 
the horse.. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Finally,  you  can  use  the hidden article to  express  your  own 
personal views and tastes (See above....) and bad taste jokes,

  Such as:- 'There were these two Amiga owners walking  along  the 
   beach  when  they chance across this  drowned  corpse...  "It's 
    Partytime!!"  they  cry,  and xxxxxxxxxxx with the help  of  a 
    tumble-dryer, they xxxxxxxxxxx from behind.... Sometime later, 
      they  depart with a shaky grin on their faces..  The  corpse 
       turns to his mate and says.....

        "It's  bad enough doing it with hedgehogs and  sheep,  but 
       Amiga owners are positively the pits my dear!!!!
     (and you can still get five years for it probably....)
    (.....Any resemblance to a TCB joke is purely deliberate)

Anyway,  I  think  this should keep Mike quiet,  so I now hand you 
back  to the rest of the hidden article,  THANK YOUUU FOR  READING 
THIS !!! THANK YOUUUUUUUUwwwwwwwwaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!!

                   --------APOLOGY---------
NB:-  The writer of this part of the hidden article is now  living 
in a straitjacket in a secure institution... We are sorry this was 
not  done sooner,  but trust you can get on with enjoying the rest 
of this issue of MAGGIE.... 
 (The Editorial team, and their pet horse..)
