 A spoof REVIEW...

By CIH (C) 12/2/91

For  those  of you familiar with the brilliant  T.V.  series  'RED 
DWARF' (Thursdays,  9.00pm BBC 2) the above title needs no further 
explanation...

For the rest of you...  Well, once upon a time, there was a 'cult' 
sci-fi  television proggie which no-one noticed (Like  'Hitchikers 
Guide'  it  had a very quiet start..) But by  series  two,  people 
started  to  take notice,  myself included,  as it had some of the 
best writing in it since the famed Hitchikers Guide....

Basically  concerns the adventures of Dave Lister,  the last human 
alive,  Rimmer,  a  hologram,  the  Cat,  an  evolved descendent of 
FELINICUS DOMESTICUS,  the android Kryten,  and the ships computer 
Holly.  RED  DWARF  is the huge mining ship on which they are  all 
stuck,  3 million years after a nuclear accident,  and from there, 
several very good half-hour episodes have taken place..

One of the topics addressed, was that of computer games addiction, 
and its ultimate form BETTER THAN LIFE,,  which took the form of a 
headset plugged into the brain which stimulated the subconcious to 
grant the user's wishes.... For a review see below....

SPECIFICATION:- One Atari-Sony Corporation custom 128-bit  virtual 
reality processor. A breakthrough design as it utilises the wealth 
of images,  sights,  sounds,  sensations etc,  stored in the users 
own  brain.  "Locks-out"  any  current input from the  real  world 
whilst in use...

OPERATION:-  Headset  plugs into CNS (central  nervous  system)  - 
driven   by   indefinite-life  low  profile   nuclear   battery... 
Interfaced  to  user  via  subconcious  portion  of  brain.  Early 
concious-memory  models where you literally wished for  items  and 
they were there,  became unplayable and boring within a few days.. 
The  subconcious interfacing ensures that the alternative  reality 
remains  fresh  and  convincing,  and that it  isn't  detected  as 
'contrived' in any way by the user.

ADVANTAGES:-  Owing to the advances described above,  it really is 
BETTER  THAN  LIFE,  or certainly better than the life offered  to 
anyone  who  is not in a position of power  and  privilege.  Early 
release  models  had runaway sales,  but current  availability  is 
somewhat more restricted (SEE BELOW..)

THE DOWNSIDE:- IT WILL KILL YOU.............

BE  MORE SPECIFIC PLEASE:- This is a classic case of 'easy to  get 
in,  but  impossible  to  get out'...  As mentioned  earlier,  all 
current stimulai are locked-out whilst BTL is in use, the user has 
to take a decision to leave,  whilst within the BTL experience, by 
imagining an exit.  Needless to say,  the enticing world generated 
by  the subconcious will not let you go so easily.  Even the  most 
strong-willed  people  have a weakness that the BTL  program  will 
locate  and play upon,  making it practically impossible to go.

........Meanwhile,  back  outside,  your  body slowly wastes away, 
unless  expert medical help is to hand,  an average user  lifespan 
can be measured in days, or at best, weeks... Suddenly yanking-out 
the headset does not help either, as the user dies of shock at the 
sudden  removal  of their  mentally-generated  Nirvana...  Several 
members  of the reviewing team on 'Virtual Reality Games  Monthly' 
and  also  on TLB Maggie version 300.01 were lost  this  way,  the 
resulting  lawsuits  forced both publications to lose  their  vast 
accumulated  fortunes,  including the priceless TLB collection  of 
fine old 20th century beer-cans...

Needless to say, within a very short time, BETTER THAN LIFE became 
illegal,   bootleg   manufacturers   took  up  the   design,   and 
distribution  took  place via the  well-established  networks  for 
other  restricted  drugs..  In  the world of RED DWARF,  sales  of 
illegal  headsets  were high amongst bored settlers on  the  outer 
planets of the solar system...

This  topic was dealt with in one of the Television episodes,  and 
at  rather greater length in the two excellent books derived  from 
the series (RED DWARF and BETTER THAN LIFE) In the end, escape for 
the  characters  was  made  possible  only  by  Rimmers  psychotic 
subconcious wrecking the utopias of the characters involved.. With 
their personal worlds collapsing around them, it became imperative 
to leave......

For  the  full  story,  I  suggest that you  read  the  two  books 
mentioned above, they have some of the best writing since Douglas 
Adams,  or get hold of a video of the early series....  Also,  the 
new series, no.4 is currently showing (BBC2 9.00pm, Thursdays)..

P.S.  If  anyone  has got the entire series 1,  and early series 2 
episodes, please let me know as I would like to see them,,, Ta!

P.P.S.  I've seen the first two episodes of the new series,  It is 
F*cking brilliant, particularly when Kryten is turned into a human 
in the second episode,  does a picture of a vacuum cleaner justify 
a "Double polaroid" or not!!!!!!!!
