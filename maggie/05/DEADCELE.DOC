(With added sound effects.... The idea being to put the bit at the 
top  through  a text-file speech synthesiser for  the  appropriate 
'aaaarrghs' and screams.  I'm just going to SAVE this bit and then 
try it to see how it sounds...... Hang on a minute......)

NOPE!!! My copy of the test file reader didn't want to come out to 
play,  and  in  fact  threw up more bombs on screen than  I  could 
quickly count,  about 40-50 in all which is a bit worrying, still, 
try it yourself with this textfile, it should work....

On to the main bit....

WELL at time of writing,  (6.12pm,  2/2/91..) we are still waiting 
for the anticipated 'Star attraction' of the year SADDAM  'MADMAN' 
HUSSEIN  to  put  in  an appearance  in  this  column.  The  main 
qualifications for appearing here are that you have to be firstly, 
Dead,  and also (In)Famous, unfortunately, Mr 'H' does not satisfy 
the  first  of these as yet,  and it is not Maggie policy to  kill 
people to order,  this being left to the likes of Mr 'H' who kills 
rather a lot of people to order. So we will have to wait to see if 
the Gulf War will give a 'Result' in this area,  as there is a lot 
of speculation and uncertainty at the moment.....

As Maggie is not due out for a month or so, as yet, I think we can 
wait and see.. In the meantime, I am collating details of his life 
and times, and cannot find any redeeming features, his life is one 
long  gaping  wound on decency and humanity,  but if  anybody  can 
enlighten me, please write to the following..

     SADDAM HUSSEIN REDEEMING FEATURE APPEAL....
 c/o usual Maggie correspondance address, which is
 54 Homestead Way, Northampton NN2 6JG (U.K.)

Now don't all rush at once........

But now, it's time for...

**********************DEAD NONENTITIES!!!************************

1.  Commodore  (U.S.  Division)  profits  for 1990.  (HAW!) A  97% 
(Wow%!!)   drop  in  earnings  according  to  Vice-president   Ron 
Alexander.....

2.  Interceptor  Group (games softco..) has now gone kaput on  the 
financial  front,  responsible for such games as 'EAGLES NEST' and 
'JOE  BLADE'.  It  seemed to have more labels  (PANDORA,  PLAYERS, 
SMASH 16, PREMIER..) than memorable games......

3.  STAMPEDE,  has not found a buyer,  which is fortunate really..  
(see  MAGGIE IV for further  details of the demise of  this  great 
disk magazine!!(HAW!!!))

4.  The  TMHT  (Teenage Mutant Hero/Ninja Turtles..) at least  one 
company  making TMHT products in the UK has gone out  of  business 
from  problems due to over-expansion,  and a sudden contraction in 
demand!!!  (Oh  dear!!!  hahahahaha!!) expect more where that came 
from, but probably not NINTENDO though...

Predicted  to go fairly soon,  another new magazine LETS  COMPUTE, 
on  sale  in the UK.  This is cheap,  and consists mainly of BASIC 
listings!!!!Disbelief!!!    This   is   clearly   an   educational 
publication,  someone having spotted a 'gap' in the market, but it 
lacks any long-term interest..  (BASIC listings died years ago!  I 
hear  you cry..) It is also on very cheap paper,  and runs counter 
to the increasing glossiness of current computer publications,  we 
will see....

12/2/91,  quick  SADDAM  flash,  apparently,  some of his defecting 
pilots attempted to bomb his palace,  as they left...  Better luck 
next time guys!!!

24/2/91........ THEY HAVE GONE IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The  ground war has started,  SADDAM has urged his troops to fight 
to the last drop of their blood, (Not his, of course...) but a lot 
of  them would rather not,  as they are surrendering...  It is too 
early to say how it is going,  but the allies are doing well,  and 
hopefully it may be over soon..... Watch this space.....

In  the  meantime,  this little scene I am about to  portray  must 
remain conjectural, I'm afraid...

THE SCENE:- SADDAM'S No.1 Command bunker in central Bahgdad..

The  day is today,  the 22nd Feb 1991,  our 'hero' is sitting in a 
corner, the last mega-dose of bad news from the front fresh in his 
mind,  quietly gibbering to himself,  the ceiling and walls gently 
shiver as the crump of bombs falling on the city above is felt, an 
aide attempts to get his attention, "Well, we could always call it 
the 'Mother of Defeats'" he says,  but SADDAM does not hear, he is 
utterly self-absorbed in the deepest misery he has ever lived...

He  looks longingly at the automatic pistol which glistens in  the 
dull  lighting,  awaiting his final gestures to a terminally angry 
world,  to  play  out  a similar scene to that in  another  place, 
forty-six years ago...  Decision taken,  he reaches for the pistol 
when........................

.....The  floor  of the bunker splits,  an instant chasm  appears, 
widens,  then there is no more floor anymore and SADDAM is falling 
into the bowels and blackness of the earth.....
 
........The  fall  continues,  there is no  comforting  cushioning 
stop, or bone-smashing thud, and as he falls, a voice is heard...

.....It is no ordinary voice, these are extraordinary events after 
all,  it is in fact a most horrendous sound, five-hundred years in 
the  making,  a  sound of torn throats gargling broken  glass  and 
eating gravel and horseshit pies...  But as it is a demonic voice, 
every word is heard and understood.......

It says "SADDAM HUSSEIN, AT LAST YOUR ARSE IS MINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"W-ww-W-what!!" SADDAM cries...

"YES!!  YOU  LAME  SHITE,  YOUR  TIME IS UP,  AND I,  BEELEZEBUB AM 
CLAIMING YOU FOR MY DOMAIN!!!!"

"B-b-bb-but God is on MY side!!" says SADDAM

All  the dictators delude themselves that way (Unless  they  think 
they are god, of course..)

"YES MORTAL,  YOU HAVE ORDERED YOUR LAST MASSACRE,  DESTROYED YOUR 
LAND,  NOW  IT IS TIME TO PAY AND YOU HAVE ALL ETERNITY TO  PAY!!! 
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So speaks the Devil, and SADDAM realises that he is in even bigger 
trouble than he can start to imagine..

However,  the  Devil  recognises a good servant and states that  a 
luxury penthouse in Hell is his,,,,,,, but he has to swim a 50,000 
million mile sea of of excrement to get there first!!!!!!!!!!

Just then the long long drop comes to an abrupt end with a  sickly 
plop!  -  SADDAM  is literally in the shit........... And he knows 
it...

The 28th Feb, IT'S ALL OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After  100  hours,  the Iraqi army collapsed in utter  and  abject 
defeat,  Kuwait  is free..  Everything points to a defeat which is 
astonishing in it's swiftness and completeness.  However, good old 
Radio Baghdad knows differently, some commonsense facts below.....

FACT 1:- Elvis Presley is alive and well,  and has been sighted at 
the  Taj  Mahal Indian restaurant (All drunks  catered  for..)  in 
Luton..

FACT 2:- Bono of U2 invented the hovercraft..

FACT 3:- Seven-headed Plutonian Methane-monsters are  responsible 
for the Eurovision Song Contest.. (This one might be true -ED..)

FACT 4:- CBM Amiga owners are really intelligent,  thoughtful, and 
not obnoxious at all...

FACT 5:- The Iraqi army has won a crushing victory over the  U.N. 
forces, and taught them 'Bitter political lessons..'

disguised as something else...

Abdul 'The Bul Bul Emir' Hussein:- The younger son, black sheep of 
the  family,  reportedly  'nice'  to small children,  goes  around 
chanting  the  slogan "Make plasticine models,  not war.."  giving 
enemies of the state sweeties to take to their executions, for the 
above  reasons,  has  been  exiled  to a  secure  'loonybin'  type 
establishment and has not been seen recently...

all,   he   is  the  Ba'ath  party  president  of  Biggleswade  in 
Bedfordshire and is not related even a little bit...

Enough bollocks for now, so good-bye 'til next time, from Chris..
