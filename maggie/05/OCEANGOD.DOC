
               OCEAN IN GREAT 16-BIT GAME SHOCKER!
               -----------------------------------

A report by Leon O'Reilly

     The date,  early January 1991. People up and down the country 
merrily  played  the latest software titles they had  acquired  for 
christmas.
     In Abermule a dog barked as the postman pushed a brown parcel 
through  the letterbox of Cwm towers.  A bleary eyed  Atari  freak 
ripped  open the jiffy bag.  Out fell a cardboard box bearing  the 
legend:
                            "BLASALEN"
     Opening the box revealed a thick manual and two disks. Closer 
examination  revealed two double sided 3.5 inch  disks.  Taking  a 
careful  sip of my coffee I leaned back and placed my feet on  the 
table, a thoughtful expression on my face.
     I  opened  the door of my office.  Various  piles  of  books, 
leaflets and boxes promptly collapsed.  Swimming through the  junk 
to  the  far corner I found my computer.  Unplugging the  SM124  I 
slotted in the lead for my CM8833.  I inserted disk A,  turned  on 
and waited.
     Suddenly  from out of my soundblaster's speaker poured an  the
most amazing  sounds,  guitars,  drums,  bass all high quality  
sampled  instruments.  Six channel digisynth at over 20Khz.  Wow!
This made me really sit up. 
     Then came some great animation with some more samples.
     Who is this game by?  I wondered as the next sequence loaded. 
The  screen filled with hundreds of small ocean symbols  scrolling 
in eight directions across all four borders and with a huge  Ocean 
logo flipping and scaling. I fell off my seat.
     Ocean? OCEAN? OCEAN??????
     The game finished loading.  The opening screen informed me it 
was a 3D extravaganza. It started with the main character boarding 
a spaceship in the bowels of the earth in a secret space  station. 
The  next sequence was flying through the cave,  a  cave  infested 
with all manner of creatures and weapons. The graphics were filled 
3D  moving  amazingly fast.  There were at least  200  colours  on 
screen,  a  great  digi-synth soundtrack and sampled  effects  and 
overscan graphics. The best thing about this level was that it was 
tremendously addictive and extremely playable.
     Set  throughout  26 levels,  stonking graphics  and  storming 
sound with terrific playability,  this was probably the best  ever 
game seen on the Atari ST.  The most outstanding thing about  this 
game was that it was made by Mancunian mishaps, Ocean.
     The phone rang. Another chap who'd received the new game.
     "It's awesome! And its by Ocean."
     A  trip  to  Abermule post office  revealed  even  more.  The 
popular press had received their copies of the game earlier.

     This   was  such  a  shock  that  it  was  gaining   national 
significance. Turning the one o'clock news on when I got back home 
I was greeted with this message:
     "...because of this,  there will be an extended  news.  James 
McScotishbutiveonlygotasmalltraceofanaccent now reports.
     "Ocean   have  been  called  the  Sheffield  United  of   the 
programming world, they find it extremely hard to keep their heads 
above  water.  To  call  their  previous  releases  dismal  is  an 
understatement. There other games include:
Robocop,  Bad Dudes versus Dragonninja, Red Heat, Shadow warriors, 
Ivanhoe,  the bug ridden F29 retaliator,  Tie break,  Narc,  Night 
Breed,  Victory road, Slap fight, Rambo 3, Run the gauntlet, Daley 
Thompson's olympic challenge and Sly spy secret agent are  amongst 
the  trash  that this Manchester based company has  been  churning 
out.  Buying  their  games is like throwing œ20 down  the  gutter, 
Sprites  move like they've just had ten pints,  sound is  appalling 
and   gameplay  worse.   Originality  doesn't  enter  into   their 
vocabulary,  their  games are either coin-op conversions  or  film 
licences  which they turn into uninspired platform  shoot-em-ups. 
They  call their games 'entertainment' which is foul abuse of  the 
word.  I'd  find it more entertaining to smear myself in HP  sauce 
and  jump  naked into a remote island full  of  cannibals  yelling 
'Dinner time!'. 
     Their latest release has taken the world by storm.  Original, 
with  good graphics and sound and astounding  playability.  No-one 
could  believe  that Ocean had the talent to create  something  so 
wonderful.  Eric  Moanon,  computer  analyst  and  professional 
boring fart comments:
     "I've been involved in computers since I was as big as a pin. 
I used to make 'em!  Eye,  them were the days. None of those fancy 
microchip thingies,  just valves and pistons.  I made a 4 megabyte 
portable  computer  out of a Bicycle  pump,  three  empty  washing 
liquid  bottles,  an abandoned spitfire engine,  a pinch of  salt, 
three  fresh eggs and a dash of whiskey.  I've always to a  little 
tipple.  Never done me any harm has it? A bit of spirit inside me, 
warms me cockles my great grandfather used to say,  and he  should 
know...."
     "Mr Moanon, could you get back to the subject please?"
     "Well  I ask you?  I've owned a spectrum since the days  they 
were a fashion accessory.  Hehehe! That used to really impress the 
girls.  I'd  say  to  'em,  'Want to come and  see  my  ZX81  with 
Rampack?'  16K it was.  They could never say no.  It was  a  great 
aphrodisiac!  My doctor told me to stop it, my heart just couldn't 
take all the strain,  but what did he know?  Bloody doctors, think 
they  know everything.  And he had ginger hair,  now what sort  of 
colour  is that for a doctor?  Anyway,  later I got the big  Atari 
thing with all the diagonal keys.  I could never work out why they 
should be diagonal! What with my arthritis, I just couldn't handle 
it!  Anyway I always enjoyed playing those really awful games from 
Ocean,  they made a day watching BBC2 films seem fun.  Now they've 
gone  and  spoilt it!  A good game from Ocean!  What's  the  world 
coming to! Next thing they'll tell me is that the Tories are doing 
more for us senior citizens!"
     Mr Moanon has recently been certified.
     I turned off the news and started chewing a nearby mouse mat. 
Something about  this whole business wasn't quite  right.  I  just 
couldn't put my finger on it. 
     Flicking  through the pages of ST Format it struck me like  a 
sledgehammer  swung from a crane.  No  advertising  campaign!  When 
Ocean release a game they waste thousands on a massive advertising 
campaign  with glossy ads inside the front cover and on  the  back 
cover  of all magazines even 'Widows Knitting Monthly'.  The  main 
feature of the ad campaign is that game isn't released until about 
a year after the campaign starts, sometimes, with games like 'Lost 
patrol',  its longer than that.  A call to Ocean should sort  this 
out.
     "Hello?"  Said  the  quivering voice of top  Ocean  bod  Gary 
Bracey.
     "It's about BLASALEN,..."
     "I  thought  it could.  Why oh why?  All I've  had  today  is 
complaints about that. He's trying to ruin us you know..."
     "Slow down," I said " who's trying to ruin you?"
     "A  disgruntled ex-employee.  We fired him so he  sneaked  in 
here and sent out preview copies of this game we're working on."
     "These  are only preview copies?" I said  startled  imagining 
how good the completed game must be.
     "Yes, we've got to put at least two years work into this game 
before we can release it."
     "It seems great to me." I said 
     "That's  the problem.  First we'll replace all those  sampled 
tunes  with some standard soundchip ones.  Beeps will do  fine  as 
explosions  -  saves  memory you see.  We have to  cut  out  those 
animation sequences,  they get tiresome.  The graphics run much to 
fast,  but  I'm sure we can slow them down.  We should be able  to 
turn those ghastly filled 3D vectors into some good old  fashioned 
monochrome wireframe graphics.  As for graphics in the border, who 
has ever heard of such a ridiculous idea? We'll throw in some very 
dodgy  collision detection and we'll make sure it bombs out as  it 
loads in the big guardian at the end of the last level."
      I put the phone down a wry smile on my face. Of course, this 
was just a demo version. Well, maybe the world was getting back to 
normal.  The  phone rang again.  I lifted the receiver to  hear  a 
frantic voice.
     "Leon, have you heard? US Gold have released a good game!"
