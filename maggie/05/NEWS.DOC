     This  section will deals with news from software  companies, 
demo crews and whatever else is going on in the scene. 


THE SCENCE AND ITS PACKERS:
---------------------------
And now......

A new packer will be developed soon, it will be based around one of
AXE's latest packers (ICE or FIRE), but will be GEM based as is 
the latest version of Automation packer 2.51

The main advantage of putting the packer into this shell, is that
it then gives you the option to chunk or lump pack programs.

An explanation of chunk and lump packing is required here (especially
for magazine reviewers... yes you michael). Chunk packing is only of
use if you have a program which reads in data files (especially random
access ones). If you have a data file of say 100k length, and the
program only wants to read the first 5k of this file, a normal pack
routine would have to load in all 100k, then depack all 100k just to
get the 5k that it wanted. With the chunk packer, you can load your
data in as low as 4k chunks, so that to get 5k back, you would only 
need to load and depack 8k instead of 100k. It is unlikely in the first
case that your program would have allowed you a file buffer of 100k
in which to load files, whereas with chunk you only need a 4k buffer.

Lump packing is basically the same as chunk packing, but instead of
leaving say 100 files on the disk, which could be very small, and
wasting disk space due to unused cluster sectors. You can join all
of the files on the disk together, then pack it as a chunk file.
When you load back from this lump file, the program will ask for a
certain file, the lump loader will look in the lump file, pick out
which chunk to load (the one containing the file) and depack it.
Using this method can save you a lot of disk space. If the disk has
many small files, then you can get greater pack results because
instead of packing one small file at a time, you can pack 20 or
30 small files at the same time, and get the benefits of size reduction
if some of the files have similar patterns. It also uses much less
directory space, and has no cluster wastage (A file which is 50 bytes
in length wastes 984 bytes of disk space).

Another development is that of our hacking cartridge (or should I
say debugging tool). At the moment you can break into any program
(sorry andy!!), and either step through code, or save out any
data in memory to dos files (without re-initialising the tos..
ha ha ultimate ripper). It is also undetactable and thanks to
atari (who put the cartridge check in front of the reset vector)
impossible to stop. Pick any well know difficult to hack demo,
European demos, cuddly demos... click... hello... nice music..
nice code... 

whats next... filled 3D I guess... see ya later. EGB.


SOFTWARE COMPANY NEWS
---------------------

     GFA Data Media are releasing a few new programs in the  near 
future  like  :  GFA  Draft  plus  3.13  (translated  by  Michael 
Schuessler  into English),  GFA G Shell,  GFA Assembler  (the  UK 
version),  Digigram Track 24 v1, Digigram Bigband v and GFA Basic 
Windows  3.  GFA  are also releasing a new version of  GFA  Basic 
which uses the TT to its full extend. 

     Electronic  Arts are more and more specialising in  products 
on the Sega Mega Drive. They have now converted 2 games which are 
PGA  Tour Golf and James Pond.  According to their leaflet it  is 
going  rather well for them at the present and they have made  an 
increase in profit.


NEW DEMO RELEASES
-----------------

     The OVERLANDERS are working on a new demo which is called LA 
VENTURE DEMO and it will probably come on two discs.  The screens 
on  the demo will be by people like NAOS,  ST CNX,  TOTAL  VISION 
INC. and many many more. 

     The  Pendragons have also been working on the  demo  section 
lately,  they are probably the first famous demo crew to  present 
an  STE ONLY demo.  This demo will have guest screens  by  groups 
like the Overlanders.

MPH AND THE RIPPER
------------------
     You  might  be  able to remember that  I  was  praising  the 
Ultimate Ripper by the Replicants in the last issue of Maggie.  I 
am still saying that it is rather a good product for the price of 
œ25  BUT the distributors have changed.  MPH were supposed to  do 
the selling here in the UK and in a few other countries but  then 
something  changed.  Apparently  the software  for  the  Ultimate 
Ripper  was  written by the Medway Boys and then  stolen  by  the 
Replicants  and anyway to cut a long story  short,  everybody  is 
suing  everybody to have the rights to sell  this  product.   MPH 
PULLED OUT STRAIGHT AWAY OUT and left the fight to the others. By 
the  looks of it Power Computing are selling it now and they  are 
not  doing a good job at it.  When we spoke to them at  the  last 
show and mentioned a few problems we had when using their product 
they  told us to get lost because their customers would  not  buy 
their  product.  In  a few other respects they  were  also  quite 
unfriendly.


     
     This  is  it now for all the latest news,  I hope  that  you 
found  them intersting.  In case you know of any computer  gossip 
like AN Cool and his sheep please let us know !!!
