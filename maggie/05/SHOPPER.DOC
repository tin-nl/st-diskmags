                   -THE SHOPPER SHOW 1991-
                   -----------------------
                              ATTENDED TO BY MICHAEL SCHUESSLER
1st Part: - the actual show
2nd Part: - demo crews who attended the show

1st Part:
---------
     Another  Show,  maybe this one is better than the last  few. 
This  show as the last few is sponsored by The  computer  Shopper 
Magazine.  The magazines influence on the exhibitors becomes more 
and  more  obvious  from  time  to  time,   there  are  more  IBM 
compatibles every time.  This is very disappointing to the  Atari 
or Amiga Users. You can say that Alexandra Palace, where the show 
took place,  might as well have been divided up into two  halves, 
one IBM and the other one ST and Amiga. 

     As  this is Maggie is only for the ST I will concentrate  on 
the Atari but I will also mention the IBM occasionally.  The show 
on  its own was quite well organized for the people  arriving  by 
tube  or train.  A few Shuttle Busses drove constantly  from  the 
stations up the hill to the exhibitions hall and back so that the 
visitors need not go through the trouble of walking up the hill.

     None of the major software companies like Ocean,  US Gold or 
even  Mirror  Soft  were represented but here  are  some  of  the 
hardware/software  companies  who were there (to each  company  I 
will give you a brief description on their new releases providing 
that there was something worth mentioning):

ST/Amiga Format(Future Publishing Ltd):
---------------------------------------
     ST  Format  will  feature a  great  assembler  called  Turbo 
Assembler  in  the  future on their cover  disc  sometime  around 
August. The assembler is currently translated into English by me. 
The assembler is in many ways better than Devpac as is  assembles 
920000 lines in one minute, the debugger is better and also quite 
a few other new features.  Watch out for GFA Source Code articles 
written by me for ST Format in the near future.

HiSoft Software:
----------------
     On the stand they were demonstrating Hisoft Basic version 2, 
Harlekin 2,  Wordfair 2, Hisoft Devpac version 3 and also Lattice 
C TT.  Hisoft are also working on their first game,  Pro  Flight, 
which looks very good. It is a Flight Simulator which will run in 
low and high resolution. 

Power Computing Ltd:
--------------------
     As usual they were simply selling their hardware.

Riverdene PDL / 16/32 PD Library:
---------------------------------
     Neither  one of the only 2 Atari/Amiga PD libraries  had  to 
present any new major releases in the Public Domain sector  which 
is  quite disappointing as there have been no new demos since  X-
Mas now.  

Softstuff Software:
-------------------
     This company has been selling their children's games.  Their 
range  becomes wider and wider,  they now sell games  like  Maths 
games (playing around with numbers),  Puzzle Book (the name gives 
it  away) and many others.  Some more of their products will  now 
also be translated into German and French.

MPH:
----
     This company was probably the company that was the only  one 
worth  watching  for more than 20 minutes.  Philipp  Harmann  was 
showing off his latest product,  the Stereo Sound Cartridge (full 
review  in  the  next Maggie).  The  cartridge's  programmer  and 
designer also were at the show and if you wanted to inquire about 
any of their products they were glad to assist (not like  another 
company  which  now sells the Ultimate Ripper  and  is  generally 
speaking not worth mentioning). 

Microdeal/ST Replay:
--------------------
     ST  Replay also had to offer a new product which  is  fairly 
similar to the Stero Monster Sound cartridge by MPH.  ST Replay's 
Cartridge  is called the Playback Cartridges and they both  allow 
you  to have a stereo sound on your home computer.  In  the  next 
Maggie this cartridge will be compared to MPH's.


2nd Part:
---------
     The  show was also attended by quite a few demo crews  like: 
Subhumans In Turkey,  Automation,  The Lost Boys, BBC, The Skunk, 
Jas San and Alokoholica. 

     The Lost Boys showed off their new mega demo which is due to 
be  released  at the International Coding Conference  #2  in  the 
Summer.  The Subhumans showed some of their latest intro  screens 
one of which is the intro for this Issue of Maggie.  By the  way, 
the  source  code  for this intro is  included  in  the  Programs 
folder. 

     We  all  met up on the Saturday and as the show  was  rather 
crowded we decided to go for a drink in the bar where we probably 
spend most of our time.  There we exchanged ideas on coding and I 
actually got a few suggestions on how to improve Maggie, like for 
example  one of which was:  Have more and better assembly  source 
code on the disc.  Well,  to this I can only say that I hope that 
you are satisfied with the source of the intro included.  At this 
point  a would like to say a BIG THANK YOU TO GORDEN WHO  ALLOWED 
ME TO INCLUDE IT, THANKS. 

     In the evening we all went for a drink in the Anglers  which 
is  a pub in Teddington(extended article on this evening is  also 
in  this  issue  of maggie).  This is about all  that  was  worth 
mentioning in this issue,
