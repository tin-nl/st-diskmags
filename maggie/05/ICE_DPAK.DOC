This  document belongs to the utility in the Programs  folder  of 
this issue of Maggie.

Right then, this little program will allow you to depack ANY data
file  that  has been packed with the Ice Packer v2.11 by  Axe  of 
Delight.  This was a much needed feature missing from the packer, 
because it was a pain in the backside if you just packed the file 
that you only had a single copy of !!

The program is really easy to use, and should any problems occur, 
then it is something that I haven't accounted for (which isn't  a 
lot !!).  All you have to do is load up my program,  and you will 
prompted  with a file-selector which requires you to click  on  a 
file  that  has  been  packed  with  the  ICE  Packer  (v2.11  or 
previous).  This program will check the header of the  file,  and 
let  you  know if the file is NOT an ICE data file  and  it  also 
recognises the Automation packer header too !!!

If the file is NOT an ICE packed file,  or any disk error occurs, 
you will be returned to the first file-selector. Either try again 
with  another  file or select 'Cancel'  from  the  file-selector, 
where  you will be given the option of returning to the  desktop, 
or back to the program.

If the file is an ICE packed file,  a screen will appear with the 
following information on it:-

  i) The length of the file (in disk-space terms)
 ii) The length of the packed file (as ICE packer knew it as)
iii) The length of the unpacked file (as it will be AFTER it  is 
     unpacked)

The reason for including both (i) & (ii) on the screen,  is  that 
some  files I found would be 20K in length,  but the  ICE  header 
would say it was only 19K in length - very odd indeed !!!

Anyway,  if  you press a key at this point (ESCAPE will escape  - 
naturally  !!)  the file will be depacked (and  the  screen  will 
flash  a bit - oo-er !!) and then another file-selector will  ask 
you for the output filename.

That's  all there is to my little program.  It works with  almost 
everything I've tried,  with one or two exceptions - eg. Life's a 
Bitch  Demo  (sorry  guys - but I was  trying  out  my  Disk2File 
Grabber,  as  well as this program and your demo was perfect  for 
testing !!!).

Have  fun,  and I look forward to updating this program  soon  so 
that  it  will  work with any version of  the  ICE  Packer  (v2.2 
onwards). This program is not compatible with v2.2 for the simple 
reason  that the source code I've been sent will not  depack  the 
extended  picture  packer files.  If anyone (Axe of  Delight  ??) 
would  like to send me an up-to-date version of the v2.2  source-
code,  then write to the address at the end of this file.  Do not 
send ANY form of pirated software, as the address is for my mates 
computer shop !!

I would also like depack source code OR the following packers:-

Automation v2.51+ (I've got 2.51r - any later versions  available??)
Ice Packer v2.2+ (especially the depack sources)
Pompey Pirates v1.9y (even if it's just the depack source code !!)
Gollum Packer (whatever it is & whoever wrote it - I want it !!)
Fire Packer (a pre-release Ice Packer - or what, I want it !!).
YOUR packer (if it's any good that is !!)

If  you are wondering what the hell I want all the above  packers 
for,  I  shall explain.  I want to write a similar shell as  this 
program, but it will be able to depack ANY form of packed data by 
the best packers available !!  The program (if it is ever started 
!!),  will be released into the Public Domain,  and I daresay  it 
could  even be well received by everyone - but I need  YOUR  help 
(packer authors especially) in order to finish it off !!

Have fun

Any problems, queries, questions etc. should be sent to the above address,
and don't even think of writing if you want copies of software etc.  I will
keep all the disks & burn the letters of idiots who write to me asking me
for the addresses of so-and-so etc.
