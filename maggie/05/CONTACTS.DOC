     Here we are again with some more lonesome Atari ST users  in 
this  big  wide  world.  I think that this  Contacts  Section  is 
becoming  rather  well  liked  as I  am  getting  more  and  more 
interesting like for example the following request:

long  or small programs that run from  the  bootsector.  Anything
