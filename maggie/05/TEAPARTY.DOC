After the ULTIMATE GFA DEMO, we received lotsa messages saying:
"Hey, guys, stop kidding! This is NO basic! Even in ASM, I cannot 
do it" (most of those critics were bad programmers!).
I  hope  that these two cool dudes from DDC won't have  the  same 
problem  'coz their demo is probably one of the very  best  basic 
demos ever made on ST.
Yes,  you  read it right,  this is a BASIC  demo,  programmed  in 
OMIKRON basic,  to be precise.  I do not know OMIKRON as well  as 
I'm  supposed to know GFA but I can tell you that these guys  use 
it in a very impressive way...

The  version of the "TEA PARTY DEMO" I tested was  a  (pre)release 
version and most of the screens had no musax yet. So I won't tell 
you a lot about musix in this review but I guess that the screens 
will be even better using some great Hippel or Count Zero sound.

So, let's run the demo...

After a few seconds, the first intro screen appears. I think it's 
very nice and looks very much like an ASM screen,  although  it's 
quite  easy to code.  The first time HOMEBOY showed it to  me,  I 
thought  it was Assembler and asked him if "this was the  OMIKRON 
demo or what?".  This screen uses steady rasters, which are quite 
uneasy to do in basic (no interruptions, remember!).

Then you get the second intro,  which features a distorting  logo 
saying "TEA PARTY DEMO",  the "melting" names of the DDC guys and 
a  scrolling  greay  ground.  It  doesn't  look  very  good  but, 
suddenly,  a big car (looks like a pink cadillac!) appears,  with 
HOMEBOY  &  FLYGUY in it.  The two boys greet  you  and  continue 
driving. The animated graphix are quite nice and very funny ("you 
cannot imagine how accurate these actually are!").

Next stop: the MAIN MENU. I must say I like it very much. There's 
a  very good music (which I didn't manage to  identify).  At  the 
bottom  of the screen,  there's a four-bitplanes scroller and  at 
the top, a (very well designed) picture of an ATARI 1040 ST. Each 
demoscreen  is shown as a different disk and you can scroll  them 
up to choose the demo you want to see.  This is,  to my  mind,  a 
very good and original idea and well programmed.  The great thing 
is when you select a demo.  The disk enters the drive and you can 
hear  the typical "click" of the drive closing system  while  the 
drive led lights.  Simple but very well coded and I just love the 
"click" (exactly the same that on my old single-sided drive).

The  screen  loads  and depack quite fast.  I  think  it's  quite 
important to note that even the packer/depacker was programmed in 
OMIKRON basic,  which is NOT something easy to do.  And if you've 
got a 1040 ST, you'll see that the MAIN MENU is resident.
These  are details but this kind of details makes the  difference 
between a "good" and an "excellent" demo.

The first screen is the VIDEO screen.  Once again,  here's a nice 
music (a bit short,  perhaps).  You can see a computer screen put 
on  a  kind of Hi-Fi music player  (with  little  equalizers).  A 
scroller passes on the screen,  announcing various digi pics from 
the  members of DDC,  the kind of tea they drink (that's the  TEA 
PARTY DEMO,  remember!), the kind of women they live with (wow! I 
would  like to have such charwomen!),  their town - ALMERE -  and 
many other things (including their own handsome, gorgeous faces).
This screen has nothing "brainblasting" but is very clean and the 
scroller is very funny to read...

The second screen is called WAVES. It features some very nice and 
impossible to describe graphic effects (some stars moving  around 
two  bars).  There's a scroller with nice fonts and a grey  plate 
scrolling  with some message on it.  This screen as good  graphix 
but runs in 25Hz and may look too "jerky".

The  third screen is the COLOR BURST.  This features very  steady 
(pseudo) rasters under a big TEA logo.  It runs in 60Hz only  and 
doesn't look very impressive but I guess that other OMIKRON basic 
programmers may wonder how they made it.

The fourth one is MEM SCROLLER. It's a very large & very fast (16 
pixels)  scrolltext (with its reflection) running between  two 
Y-distorting OMIKRON logos.  Although the scroll is not very easy 
to read, this screen is very good for basic and has a nice music, 
too.

The fifth screen is the FLYGUY STRIKES BACK screen.   It's one of 
my  favourite  in this demo since I find it impressive  and  very 
clever.  At the beginning,  there's a simple 1 bitplane scroller, 
soon followed by a 2 biplanes DDC logo on the whole screen. Then, 
a  very  nice  2  bitplanes  brown  "rocky"  background  appears, 
scrolling  on  the  whole screen.  1 biplane +  2  biplanes  +  2 
bitplanes = 5 bitplanes.  But... the ST has only 4 bitplanes!!! I 
told you it was very clever! More: there are various effects with 
the  scrolline.  It goes in front and then behind the  DDC  logo, 
then you can see the background through it and so on...

After  that,  you've got the SINUS SCROLLER.  It features a  nice 
moving ground (using color shifting).  The top half of the screen 
features a city under the rising sun.  And there's,  of course, a 
one  bitplane scroller,  which dists in nice  sinus  waves.  Once 
again,  this is something quite uneasy to programm in basic  (and 
in 50Hz, of course!).

The  seventh  screen  is  the  BIG  SCROLL.  It's  a  very  small 
scroller...  huh...  sorry... It's a HUGE scroller (made by small 
blocks  of dots) on almost the whole screen,  with  lotsa  colors 
running through it.  A bit like our big scroller in the  ULTIMATE 
GFA DEMO, with more colors but simple graphix...

The  following  demo is the 1 SONG.  It's a QUARTET demo  with  a 
clean  digi-song  played  from  OMIKRON.   There  are  no   other 
animations,  which is quite normal since the QUARTET player takes 
the whole VBL to play the digisounds.

The nineth screen is the ARNOLD screen.  It was made by a  friend 
of  the  DDC  called Arnold SCHWARTZENEGGER  (or  something  like 
that).  I guess it will work on 1040 only but it looks good. It's 
basically a sequence of a very nice film which you can move using 
the  cursor keys.  The picture themselves are well digitized  (in 
orange-yellow  colors) and features,  I think,  FLYGUY using  his 
special TEA-THROWER to send some tea-bags to his friend HOMEBOY.
You  will  also notice the tea-pot cooking  behind  him  (beware, 
FLYGUY,  it seems to be VERY hot!  Ah,  ah!).  By the way, you'll 
discover that FLYGUY has lotsa muscles (he's a very tough guy!).

The last screen is called "LAST SCREEN" (right name!).  I have to 
admit that it's my favourite screen in the demo.  I find it  very 
impressive.  It looks a bit like our SPREADPOINT II but there are 
more small scrollers and a big colorful DDC logo separated in two 
parts  which moves to the left and to the right.  This screen  is 
technically brilliant and looks quite stunning. I hope there will 
also be a good muzak to enhance it...

Ok.  Finally,  I  would like to say that this demo is  very  well 
finished.  All the coding is clean and there are no bugs  (sounds 
logical but even the CUDDLY DEMOS have some little "bugs"). To my 
mind, this is a truely positive point.
The graphix are also quite good (some are even very nice) and the 
ideas  of some screens are original,  which is a  very  important 
quality. 
And,  last but not least,  the scrollers are often funny and very 
well written in real english.  More: the two DDC members are very 
cool  guys (I met them on the STNICCC in Holland where they  come 
from) - Hey, HOMEBOY & FLYGUY, send me the money now! -

Once again, this demo is PURE basic code but looks great. the 
only ASM routine used is to play the drive "click" in the main 
menu.

So,  even if you're a tough ASM coder,  you should take a look at 
the TEA PARTY DEMO, I'm sure you won't regret it!

                         See you later, have fun with MAGGIE 5.0!
