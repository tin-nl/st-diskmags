        ----------------------------------------------------
               for:  Maggie 5.0 by The Lost Boys
               ---------------------------------


 Why use fonts - well,  for the simple reason that they neaten up 
your programs instead of that boring, humdrum ST character set. A 
nice Macintosh style font,  or even a mini-Times Roman font  just 
make your amazing program that little bit better !!

  Before I explain the source-code,  the fonts format that  I  am 
using  are  the  'industry standard' Fontkit format  as  used  by 
Jeremy  Hughes  in his useful Fontkit range  of  programs.  These 
programs are available as Public

Domain versions,  or as a full-blown commercial program costing a 
mere œ20, which will allow you to design Signum, Calamus, GEM and 
printer fonts,  as well as the fonts that we're interested in for 
GFA uses.

 There are two file formats required for our purposes,  and these 
are  the system fonts,  and they have the 'A1*.FON'  &  'A2*.FON' 
file-prefixes.  These file-formats are for high reslution  (8*16) 
and low/medium resolution (8*8) screens respectively.

 The following source code is for GFA BASIC v3.5 ONLY,  I managed 
to get them working once on GFA BASIC v2.xx,  but this was mostly 
due  to some direct addressing used,  which as  every  programmer 
knows  is  extremely nasty (according to Atari  anyway  !!).  So, 
onwards with an explanation of how to set them up,  use them, and 
get rid of them when you quit your programs.


                    Setting Up Your Fonts.
                    ----------------------

  This just takes three lines of GFA BASIC,  and two of them  are 
INLINEs !!  And to save any long-winded explanations, here is the 
listing:-
        '
     INLINE mono_font%,4114          ==> High Resolution Font
     INLINE medium_font%,2066        ==> Low/Medium Resolution Font
        '
     font_set                        ==> Install new fonts


  The  'font_set' procedure is fairly  easy  to  understand,  and 
should be left well alone until you decide to mess about with  it 
yourself !!  Just merge in the procedure into your  program,  and 
leave it there !!

 OK so far ???  I hope so,  but if you're having any difficulties 
then  just  look at the completed source code in  the  'PROGRAMS' 
folder on this Maggie disk.

  Only once you know what you're doing,  you can  start  deleting 
bits  of  my routines that you do not require if  you're  writing 
'TOS' programs - ie no alert boxes,  no menu-bars etc.,  then you 
could  delete  all  the references to setting  up  the  GEM  font 
addresses.

  And  to  switch  off the user  fonts,  just  call  the  routine 
'off_font'.  This  call can be made at any time,  but it is  best 
left  at  the  'bottom of the pile' in  your  quit  routine.  For 
example:- 

        PROCEDURE kwit
         SETCOLOR 0,&H777
         SETCOLOR 3,&H0
         SETCOLOR 15,&H0
         CLS
         off_font
         EDIT
        RETURN

  It  would  be a good idea to set the 'ON BREAK'  &  'ON  ERROR' 
routines  to  point to your quit routine,  as the fonts  will  be 
turned off in the event of any catastrophe.  If they are not  de-
installed,  you will find that the file-selector will be replaced 
by  a  box full of wierd characters because the ST  still  thinks 
your  font  is  stored  in the INLINEs'  and  these  INLINEs  are 
overwritten when you return to the GFA BASIC interpreter.

  I have included two different fonts with the source  code,  and 
they  are the afore-mentioned 'Macintosh' & 'Times  Roman'.  I've 
included   the  files  for  high  resolution  and   also   medium 
resolution,  so  there is no excuse for your handy  utilities  to 
contain a nice, new, easy to read font (how about
it Michael - a nice new font in Maggie ???) !!

  Well,  I'll  be off now,  as I've got a few  other  programs  & 
articles I want to write for Maggie.  I know that I promised this 
before Issue 1 of Maggie,  but I've been busy killing viruses for 
the last year or so !!!
