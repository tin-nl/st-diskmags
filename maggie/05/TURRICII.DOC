
               T U R R I C A N  2 - THE FINAL FIGHT..
         
 AKA "Here we go againnnnnn!!"

It  has been some time,  about three minutes or so,  since Morgul, 
the  hastily  made-up three headed incarnation of  evil  has  been 
destroyed,  but  throwing aside the half-bottle of finest  rot-gut 
you  were  about to down in a single gulp with a slice  of  lemon,  
you  hear of the planet Landorin which is menaced by  the  MACHINE 
and (his/her/it's?) hordes... (GULP!!! -Ed..)

Being  the kill-crazy sod that you are,  it's on with the Titanium 
posing-pouch and pectoral enhancer with built in  multidirectional 
mega-death shooting out of all orifices,  and that is about it for 
the plot, as per usual...

As you may have guessed,  this is the sequel to TURRICAN, reviewed 
but aborted in Maggie 4, (Will it get in and WORK this time??) and 
those  familiar with the earlier game will not be disappointed  at 
all.  Nothing  is  lost  from  the original,  why change  what  is 
nearasdammit perfect? and a few gains have been made as well...

Method of play, and difficulty levels have been kept as they were, 
the  all-important  playability has thankfully survived  into  the 
sequel.  Some  differences  are  apparent,  as Rainbow  Arts  have 
tightened  up on 'Timeouts' the 500 second time limit for a  level 
stays  with  you and is not reset upon losing a life,  also  extra 
credits  are only gained upon collecting a set amount of  crystals 
(100 for each credit to enable you to continue when all lives  are 
lost)

Now the good news, the graphics in TURRICAN II manage to look even 
prettier  than  before,  lots more graduated colours for the  sky, 
some even more exotic aliens,  and extremely weird levels executed 
on  the  same  grand  scale as  it's  predecessor.  End  of  level 
guardians (mid level ones too..) are tougher than before and stomp 
all  over  you at the slightest provocation (or even at  the  very 
extreme provocation posed by yourself at the time...)

The  extensive weapons fit for Turrican has been revamped for  the 
sequel,  particular  mentions  go  to  a  vastly  superior  blast-
everything-in-your-path laser, which at maximum power, is as large 
as the Turrican sprite, a new 'ricochet split-shot' thing which is 
hellishly  useful in tight enclosed caverns,  and a new  'Ultimate 
weapon'  where you turn into a laser and bomb-spitting  gyroscopic 
mad-fiend....  Most  of  the  usual  stuff,  such  as  spray-shot, 
lighting, smart-bombs etc, are there as well....

The sound consists of a remix of the original tracker type tune on 
the  title screen,  and the same replay routines too,  and some of 
the Mad Hippy's best ever soundchip work in the game itself, which 
include the infamous digi-drum routines mixed-in with a whole load 
of reasonable spot effects...

The  game  starts off rather like the original,  with caverns  and 
waterfalls, some waterfalls leading to hidden systems of caves, but 
later on in the level there is a rather more individual feel, with 
crowds of hostile ball-bearings (Those 3-D bitmapped balls put  to 
use in a game at last!!!!) blob-like hard-to-destroy aliens. Later 
on,  there is an underwater level,  set deep in the complex, and a 
horizontally  scrolling SCRAMBLE-like level..  I got to about  the 
middle  of the game and retired with a massive splitting  headache 
after about an hours solid playing,  again,  expect to find a huge 
variety  of  scenery on hidden locations to  explore  where  extra 
lives are to be found...

Ratings:- See below,,

GRAPHIX:- 92% - These manage to improve on the original,  which is 
no  mean  feat in itself,  like before there is a huge  amount  of 
excellent work in the game which all runs smoothly..

SONIX:- 89% - The title tune is 'more of the same' which is ok  if 
not world-shattering, but the sound-chip tunes are great!!

PLAYABILITY:-  93% - This game retains all of the  playability  of 
before,  it  is a bit tougher on issues like time-outs,  and extra 
credits,  you  have to search a little bit harder for extra  lives 
and  power-ups,  but  these  are  still  in  plentiful  supply  at 
strategic points in the game...

OVERALL:-  91%  -  A  slight drop from  the  94%  awarded  to  the 
original, the game is virtually the same as before, but excellence 
comes at a slightly higher price than previously, ('Market Forces' 
I hear you cry..) It is now œ24.99,  but still better value than a 
lot of games at the same price I could mention..

ENVOI  -  You may be interested to note that  the  title  sequence 
includes  'The  story  of Turrican..' who started out  life  as  a 
purple-haired character on a space-ship which was attacked by  the 
self-same 'MACHINE' confronted in this game. Turrican was the sole 
survivor you see,  and swearing vengeance on the MACHINE he put on 
one of the new TURRICAN (tm) Battlesuits,  and the rest,  well you 
know about by now....
