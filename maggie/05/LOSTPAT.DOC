Reviewed By Stuart Bray.


THE SCENARIO

A  group  of  seven  U.S  serviceman  are  being  transported  by 
helicopter  back   into  the  heart  of  enemy  territory.   Your 
destination the rather more hospitable camp called Du  Hoc.   But 
if  fighting  a  war  in Vietnam wasn't enough  of  a  pain  your 
"Copter" develops a fault and hits mother earth on an unscheduled 
stop.   So here you are,  with wounded ,  ill equipped troops who 
are  approximately  60  miles  from Du  Hoc  complete  with  four 
sandwiches and a "Cupper Soup".   Actually Private Weaver is also 
carrying  a "Pot Noodle" but as no one is prepared to eat  it  we 
can't  really  call it food.   Apart from the fact  that  someone 
could have them up for misrepresentation.    Anyway, your task is 
traverse  across enemy held territory until you reach Du Hoc  and 
safety.  





THE GAME PLAY

So how does this transfer itself into visuals.  Well you have two 
main  screens to move between.  Firstly there is a status  screen 
showing  the  members of your party.   This  includes  percentage 
marks for their Morale and Strength levels, whether they are dead 
or  alive,  of  key  importance really,  and  to  whom  you  have 
allocated the tasks of Lead and Scout.   Each member of the  team 
have different qualities and careful use of these will very  much 
alter your chances of success.  It is of course no use allocating 
a white sticked asthmatic to the role of scout unless you have  a 
death wish.   Also prolong use of the same person in any one role 
will  result  in a heavy drop in both their  strength  and  moral 
levels.   Screen  two consists of contour map that is really  two 
screens in width.  This you can scroll around so that you can see 
your destination and the key features such as rivers, enemy bases 
and  village camps.   The bottom part of this same screen is  the 
area from which you issue orders.   This allows choices  of,  the 
speed  at  which you consume your meagre rations,  the  speed  or 
caution of your marching,  and whether you rest, dig in or search 
the  surrounding  area.    There  is also a  large  compass  that 
enables  you to  choose the direction of your travel.   When  you 
issue  orders  to march the symbol depicting your  patrol  moves,  
this is often accompanied by a picture or short animated sequence 
showing  you progressing through the undergrowth,  or  through  a 
river.   These are a real treat to watch and added to a  oriental 
theme  music  that plays throughout,  there is  real  feeling  of 
atmosphere.  Both of these can be turned off and this does result 
in faster game play and stops you going out later a whistling the 
latest hit in China.



THE SUB GAMES

In  all honesty you don't ever get far before you are  confronted 
by one of the four main sub games.  These occur whenever you meet 
up with the Viet Cong and take the form of the action or shoot'em 
up  elements of the game. 

(1)  You  may have to fight hand to hand combat with a  lone  V.C 
patrol in which case a  your selected team member can either kick 
or punch his opponent into defeat.   Why he didn't just blow  his 
brains out was never explained to me.   

(2)   If you are pinned down by enemy fire you must look  through 
your  rifle  sights  to spot the flashing  muzzle  of  the  enemy 
sniper,  and then blow the crap out of him before someone  really 
gets hurt.   

(3)   You  can be trapped by machine-gun fire in which  case  the 
flashing muzzle is once again your prime target,  only this  time 
you throw grenades to do the job. 

(4)    The  best,  and  most deadly of the  four  sub  games,  is 
encountering a full V.C patrol.   This leaves you hidden behind a 
wall whilst the mass of nasty Communist foreigners treat you to a 
display  of target practise.   The art to winning  this  revolves 
around popping up from your hiding place enough to kill off their 
troops,  rather  than being over run,  but not staying  up   long 
enough for them to turn you into a string vest. 


THE RESULTS

So  does  all this added up to a good game?   Well  Yes  and  No.  
Certainly  you  begin  to hold your  breath  after  issuing  your 
orders,  for  if the disk drive gives a whurrs then you know  you 
have got to face action.  You start hoping that you won't have to 
play  any  of  the  sub  games that  makes  the  whole  thing  so 
interesting.   Having said that I have three main criticisms.  

(1)   It  does seem that no matter which route you take  you  are 
only  going to get a few moves before coming in contact with  the 
enemy.   There  is therefore no complicated computer  data  being 
evaluated  resulting  in you having to fight or not fight.   Just 
an  allowance  of a certain number of moves.This  makes  a  large 
percentage of your moves on the map almost irrelevant.  

(2)  The sub games are fine to a degree but each of them are only 
shadows  of similar games available as separate items.   What  it 
means is that you are getting the mediocre versions of many games 
instead of the top quality version of just one game.   This  then 
becomes  just  a matter of what you believe is value  for  money.  

(3)   Lastly the disk swapping,  as it comes on  three  different 
disks,  does begin to become tiring.   This is at its worst  when 
you  have  to  load two disks in quick  succession  in  the  full 
knowledge that its about to tell you that you've been killed  and 
your attempt is at an end.   Having said all this the game  still 
offers something for nearly everyone and it was rather refreshing 
to see war shown as something frightening and dangerous,  instead 
of all this death and glory shit.
