# ST Demoscene Diskmag Repository

## About

This is a little collection of some ST Demoscene diskmag articles in uncompressed form.
I had this lying around for ages (started 2000, revisited 2014) now - and it found a safe place here (for now, at least).

## Disclaimer
All of the content should be seen as the expression of their respective authors.  Please refer to the original publications (e.g. at [demozoo.org](https://demozoo.org)) to put things into conext, if necessary. Since these works are public domain, this is published in the mindset of "fair use".

## State of affairs
This is by no means complete and also not very thoroughly checked for depack errors. No conversion took place whatsoever. See this as a first dump and feel welcomed to help decompress and add even more mags.

### Texts
The texts are depacked as-is, embedded images can be alost always found alongside the txt file (but be warbed: they use ancient ST file formats).

### "Toolset"
This repository contains C source to depack ice packed files (courtesy of Mr. Ni/TOS Crew). Also there's a sorry excude for a golang conversion of Mr. Nis Atomic depacker (just C code embedded in a golang sceleton AFAIR).
Then there are two tools to unlink the Maggie/DBA data file, also in golang.
Don't expect any of this to work on current golang/C/whatever versions. The toolset is not tested in any way upon release.
