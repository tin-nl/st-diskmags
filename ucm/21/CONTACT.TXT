We want your feedback, want to know your feelings, thoughts! We want  to know if
you like or hate us, what we could do better and so on!

Write down what you think, all things will be published, with or without our own
comments, in the next issue.

Furthermore we are interested  in any kind of help as well. If you want to paint
some menu stuff, intro  picture, do  some music or  ascii art, wanna  write some
articles or supply some hot and new stuff, want  to create a kewl intro  or even
want to join the .tSCc. staff.

Btw... it doesn't matter if you just join our forces for one issue only, we like
any kind of support, even if we hope to find as many  people who want to support
us in the regular writers posse as possible.

Ok, for any comments and suggestions... use the following email address...

moondog@atari.org

There will be no snail mail address given atm, just because I'm going to move my
flat sometimes  this year  again. People who want to  use a part  of our service
(the snail mail thingie) will be informed about the current address.

Ok... so we hope you show up with stuff that comes straight from your mind!
