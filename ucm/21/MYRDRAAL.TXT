It was damn silent  around the swedish one-man-force for  long time now, but out
of a sudden  THE SINNER and his one-man-band AVENDESORA strikes  back to torment
us with his coding blasts again.

Maybe you  remember his old  releases, some basic intros  without any design and
originality, far away from beeing worth  to be watched  twice. I wondered that I
didn't saw anything from  him and so I stumbled over his homepage again and hey!
There was a new release! The long winter in the north of Europe must have frozen
his brain and so he striked back with another production...

"MYRDRAAL" was announced as selfmade slideshow, and so I wondered if he, without
big coding abilities, maybe is an unknown good artist. So I leeched it and let's
check what he brings us...

The demo starts with some chipmusic by an  unknown composer and... the usual use
of the Atari system font for  the introduction... The letters  are coming closer
together after they were printed onto  the screen, cool  effect (...) and what a
marvellous use of that designish' green color! Boah!

The thing goes on with a mediocre logo of AVENDESORA and the slogan: Only a dead
PC is a good PC... really? Dunno, I just  know  that  the pictures  that are now
following  are created with a  dead PC or  maybe a  dead brain... or did he gave
them in with hexadecimal code? Anyway, I never saw such a crap in the last time,
I just remember some dumb fake demos, done in the same grafical "style"...

After a few pix (what a luck... I was nearly going to vomit onto my keyboard...)
the greetings-screen comes up, just a white background with the greetings print'
on it in... system-font (aaah!) in grey-green. And because he wrote to press
any key to exit I really was in hope that my pain will end now...

But I was so damn wrong... The  next thing is  a downscaled  scanned photo of an
Atari with the  info that all code and ideas were by  THE SINNER... what ideas I
have to ask! Maybe the idea for  the following  screen? A blue blinking one with
the credits, where  he revealed who has done what (shouldn't  be a problem for a
one-man-band, eh?) and what  music he  listened while creating this little piece
of shit... and after reading that list I got the right impression... a guy who's
mixing up dumb  heavy metal with the  All Saints and  Destinys Child, must be so
freaked out to create such a shit without feeling ashamed...

After pressing space some crap appears on the screen, followed by a black screen
with some saying I don't understand and the thing wents back to desk...

Final words... I know, some people will hate me because of my rude writing style
here, but  I don't care about it. I tried to  find some  positive  moments while
writing  this review but I didn't found any. I just wonder what strange software
pearls are coming out for our beloved  Atari's... The only  positive thing I can
check is that THE SINNER is doing something at all, but the problem is how he is
doing it... Alone the  idea to make a slideshow  isn't brainblasting at all, but
to create a show  with such shitty  pictures, with so  bad design, no... I can't
find any words... delete that crap!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  1o % - what is original in doing a slideshow?!
effex.........  o5 % - a screen writer and some blinking screen...
grafix........  1o % - mostly just a trashcan filled with pixels.
musix.........  55 % - ok chipsound, but nerves a bit with the time.
design........  oo % - black background, ugliest colors since long time...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  16 % - what a crap!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heja to THE SINNER, ever seen  some pixel work by  other freaks?! It is possible
to do (at least a bit) more with the ST ...
