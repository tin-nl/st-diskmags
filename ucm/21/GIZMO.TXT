 INTERVIEW with:                                             ÒGi2MO/tSCc^Icebird
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ÚUCM: Hello Gi2mo!

ÛGIZ: Hi there!



ÚUCM: First tell us a little bit of your computer history.

ÛGIZ: My first  contact with  the wonderful  world of computing  was the zx81. My
Û     first computer was  the C64, which is still my favourite nostalgic machine.
Û     Then followed a PC, Acorn Archimedes, Amiga 1200, Atari Falcon  and finally
Û     a RiscPC, of course I collected during this time a lot of machines I didn't
Û     use as mainsystem, like several CPC's, C16, Plus4, Mega ST's and so on....
Û     Atm my collection is pretty extensive. The choice of the systems was purely
Û     because of  their graphical  possibilities, or in  other words: Amicapaint,
Û     Deluxepaint  2e, several  Archimedes  painters,  DPaint 4 AGA,  Delmpaint!,
Û     Indypaint, and at  least the  first truecolorpainter in  payable existance:
Û     Photodesk on RiscPC. :)



ÚUCM: Well, what about your Roots?

ÛGIZ: I think my roots  are stuck to the  Archimedes and  Atari scene, cause they
Û     where the first scenes I got personally in contact with.



ÚUCM: Why Acorn?

ÛGIZ: Cause it was a brilliant machine and Os. In fact, it still is.....
Û     Unfortunately the hardware is a bit outdated compared to today's PC's... :(
Û     but maybe the new machines, that arrive this year put 'em back in the line.



ÚUCM: What about the scene on Acorn? How big is it?

ÛGIZ: Small but smart.... the only thing I always missed where other  graphicians
Û     (I know exactly 2!), that's nothing against the graphics-elite on falcon or
Û     amiga....:(



ÚUCM: Why did you join an Atari crew?

ÛGIZ: Why not? :) I've got several  Ataris, including a  Falcon030... I've always
Û     been along the Atari scene, time to step into :)



ÚUCM: What are the projects you are doing graphics for atm?

ÛGIZ: Next to some smaller graphicsjobs, I'm  heavily  preparing some content for
Û     the next  Mekka-Symposium  together with  KB and Ryg, which is  secret atm,
Û     (sorry), but  be sure  it will  rock :), and  during the  daytime (job) I'm
Û     learning a lot softimage|xsi, which is the most promising new 3d-app on the
Û     market, imo. That's quite enough to fill a day with 24 hours *doh*, ...
Û     seriously I have more graphic jobs to do, than I can work out....


ÚUCM: Do you think that Diskmags will survive in the future?

ÛGIZ: Sure, no doubt. They have a special atmosphere that is hard to beat.



ÚUCM: Tell the world a little bit about Icebird. How many members are in the crew
Ú     and on what projects you are working on right now?

ÛGIZ: Icebird consists of 9 members atm.
Û     MrHill organizes the Codecraft 3 Competition for RiscOs machines,
Û     Exoticorn is working on a gba-demo for Mekka-Symposium and...
Û     Merlyn, MC Laser, Skid and I  tried to put up  some demostuff  on PC, which
Û     failed in the first run...wait and see..I'm sure we'll manage it someday :)



ÚUCM: You were also one  of the organizers  of the  Siliconvention 1997. Have you
Ú     ever thought about doing another convention like this? Or can we maybe
Ú     expect something similar in the future?

ÛGIZ: I definitly  will do a  party again  someday, atm, I'm  organising the more
Û     familiar Yelling Jam in Bremen for the 2nd time...
Û     check  out    http://www.yellingjam.de  ,  cori  is  putting  all  official
Û     informations on  the  domain. Party will be  around  summer. Oh and  do not
Û     expect any useable information on the site before easter 2001, :)
Û     Beside that, I'm willing to help in the organisation of the Mekka-Symposium
Û     a bit. (stuff I'm working on, --> the secret thing (pshhh!::)) *lol*



ÚUCM: What keeps you going? What is your motivation?

ÛGIZ: Can't  stop  moving, learning, and  getting  better, ...at  least  it's the
Û     demoscene  that  keeps  me  alive, as  long as  there are  people producing
Û     instead of consuming computerstuff, I'm  with them, no matter  which system
Û     or  computer...I  think  that's  one main  difference  between  me and most
Û     sceners, they  can't get  their ass  up to go  over to the  next  system or
Û     computer, cause it's a dull one, (its always dull) ..so they stuck to their
Û     old machines  and stop  producing, cause  the scene is getting  smaller and
Û     smaller....I'm  always happy to meet  sceners from  the past in  the actual
Û     pc/console scene...just to know that they are still active  keeps me a good
Û     feeling.



ÚUCM: How should your Dream machine look like?

ÛGIZ: Keyboard-computer,  dozens  of  videoconnection  possibilities, seperatetly
Û     accessible, input/output  of rgb, vga, fbas, sound, ...xconvert etc.. a LOT
Û     of RAM, Os inside  flashram, small but powerfull Os (Magic, RiscOs), killer
Û     3d hardware, like on actual arcade-boards, interpreted basic (or  something
Û     like that) incl. in  the  Os, with  an  inline-assembler (Risc, please) and
Û     TOTAL access  to every bit and hardware in the  computer, Icepaint  and xsi
Û     running, and of  course a biiiiig  harddisc. A  unique soundchip, something
Û     with heart, and of course the usual stuff like network options, etc....



ÚUCM: Do you think that alternative systems will win someday against the nowadays
Ú     dominating windows pc's?

ÛGIZ: Uff, guess  not,..but I hope  that there  are always  enough people to keep
Û     alternatives alive...my  main problem with this  thema is, that many people
Û     want an  alternative, cause they  hate Windows, and they switch  to the Mac
Û     out of protest, without noticing that its almost the same in green.
Û     Its the same slow dinosaurlike Os, dull hardware (hey, ati manufactures the
Û     graphics system- and it is damn slow)...and  so on...atm, there is  no real
Û     alternative  system that  is able to conquer.....maybe linux/unix  one day,
Û     but to be  honest, I think it's as much a dinosaur as Windows  is, so there
Û     wouldn't be a real change. I hope that someday the homecomputers come back,
Û     nice  custom-computers with a simple programming language  installed in the
Û     Rom...no long boot times..and so on..
