The lately  also official  renamed band  FUN INDUSTRIES appeared  with the first
module musix compilation this  summer. This demo was thought to be released last
year short after the PMP and is the first lifesign of the band since one year at
all now... just  remember, after  the "ALIVE" demo for  the ERROR IN LINE  party
back in 1999, except some "NUN" fake release on the PMP party  nothing  was done
anymore. And because some other bands stopped in compiling musix to music demos,
another one has to take over the job...

Oki, this  demo starts  with  the usual  FUN INDUSTRIES animation, showing  some
cogwheels turning  and gripping  into each other. After that  a picture  showing
some  plants  on a grey  landscape (maybe that are the flat lands of Holland? ;)
informing about the date of the PMP...

It fades away and gives way to the  music menu. This one features  the titles of
the single songs  in the upper half of the screen, displayed  by a bad, bad font
that is a hit into the face of any graphician.
In the lower part  of the screen, some  tunnel effect  with changing textures is
displayed... the range is of yellow fuji's to blue somewhat and  finally between
those two party some sound analyzers are displayed, changing the colours anytime
as the songs are played.

Hmmm... what I have to  say about the presentation. Alone the fact that the demo
wasn't thought to be released in this way but was released  so anyway because it
would be  wasted on some  harddisk if not, speaks a whole book. It  looks like a
fast smashed together thingie... sorry.

But as it is  a music demo I will focuse on the soundtracks  now. The first four
or better five were composed by DFORCE, to whom this music compile is dedicated.

"FUZZY LOGIC" is some technoing stuff, reminding in some samples and parts, esp.
in  the last  patterns to TOMMY of AVENA, sometimes, also to  STAX of LAZER... a
nice track.

"EXISTENCE"... again techno stuff, using the same kind of samples as in the tune
before and so it seems to be the follow up in one hand, at the other hand I must
ask why he  didn't mixed up both modules to one, because  the first  one changed
the style several  times and so it wouldn't be a big difference  to add that one
to it too... Before I forget, I like the hard drums...

"INSANE" is the third  one, again a fast one, using  some  strange  samples that
remind me sometimes to the cruel ones the old .tnb. musicians  were using... But
after all it isn't very spectacular...

"SATISFACTORY" is called  to be housy  by the  composer itself, but for me it is
more a typical dance music, reminding with the used samples  some times a bit to
DOMM of ANIMAL MINE's  late  work (just  for  the "DREAMS" dentro), esp. in  the 
intro part and in later parts as well.

"INVITATION PMP" was done by COMP7, and  says with the name  for what... for the
INVITATION  to the PREMILLENIUM PARTY. It features  minimalistic  drum work, and
some  french-a-like samples (the DJAMM musix from  his times at EKO) as  well as
some stuff reminding  to the old  techno tracks from  the early  nineties (U96 -
Das Boot... urgs).

"SUCK ON THIS", made  by  NO XS of OXYRON, starts  slowly to  go over  into some
breakbeat stuff  accompanied with  those damn bigbeat  things and  later on even
sawing  guitar samples. Strange mix... I don't  like it  because of  the bigbeat
and speech samples...

"WARM SUMMER NIGHT" by PERKELE of DEPRESSION is an ordinary  dance music module,
you heard  too  much of  them with  the  time. The same  melodies, the same used
samples, the same arrangements... Boring...

Yes... and that's it... I think it's time for the...

FINAL WORDS

Dunno, that  module compile  doesn't leaves  the best  impression, esp. when you
compare it to the stuff released within the last years and even the first module
compiles on Falcon were much more stylish designed than this one. It seems to be
smashed  together in a  hurry, fast and loveless... No special  intro, just some
tunnel effect  and sound analyzers in the menu. No big graphical  work... and so
the modules stand  more or less alone and therefore  they aren't good  enough at
all. The most aren't bad, but don't kick ass. Maybe they're  interesting for the
people who like  the mentioned composers that  seem to be some  kind of idols of
the composer but I prefer stuff that is drilling into your brain because of it's
own style... anyway, music is just a matter of taste...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  3o % - What is original on a music compile?
effex.........  5o % - Tunnel, sound analyzers, some fading, not brainblasting.
grafix........  45 % - An ok intro pic and nothing more...
musix.........  65 % - mainly DTM modules of different styles and quality...
design........  15 % - There isn't much to call design... maybe the FUN ani
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  41 % - Has a hard stand besides MODULATION, CHIPPIN series...
