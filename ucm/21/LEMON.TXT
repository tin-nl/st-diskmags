The swedes  striking back after long time without  any releases... they're known
for their quick and short releases, and so you  can imagine what is  waiting for
us in those two different files...

2 different files  for 2 different versions, for standard Falcons (with FPU) and
enhanced  ones with Centurbo2 boards. The versions  differing in  the resolution
and an effect who isn't shown in the standard version.

Ok, and  because I just  have such a  standard Falcon I  runned this  version at
first and the demo started with the usual screen where you can choose the screen
you're using to watch the demo. I took number 2 for RGB and the demo starts...

At first some noises can be heard, the screen is fading to black and a nice MIND
DESIGN logo appeared on  the screen, faded out and followed by the ERROR IN LINE
compo picture by PARANOID (unfortunately it's just 16 colours STlow).

This short intro sequence is followed by the first effect, an environment mapped
object, which blinks with the stomps of the music. Nice effect, but the enhanced
version brings the same thing with a  dark coloured whirling effect in the back,
a bit slower but even on standard Falcons (at least  that is my opinion) without
any doubt watchable... it isn't as far as slow as the COBRA demos...

Ok... next effect coming up, unfortunately without  any spectacular fading stuff
or transition, it's  a mirrored  wobbling and  distorting  texture on ground and
"sky", acompanied with a big and complex line vector  torrus, circling around on
the screen. The enhanced version brings the double resolution for this.
Again a nice screen, no question.

And unfortunately the  credits part is already coming up, the credits are coming
in from the right side, are bumpmapped by a little shiny object flying around on
the screen. In the background there is some wobbling texture stuff again.
Again a good screen and unfortunately it's  the last one. After this  the screen
is changing to black and the desktop appears again... meuh...

They just wanted to show that  they're still  alive and kicking  and did it very
well... But now we want to see a real big demo! Go on and kick some butts!

The last words...

A stunning "little" intro  for Falcon, but  it lacks a  bit of design and leaves
the hard impression  that it's unfinished or something and  as DEEZ wrote in the
TXT-file for the demo he stopped the work on it for a bigger project.
It's a bit  sad, because with  a few effex more and some more design this little
demo had matched it to be the real breakthrough for the band. Too bad...
Not to  forget the point  that this demo  features some gloomy  atmosphere and I
like it very much in comparison with all those funny and colourfull stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  8o % - The used effex are some kind of up to date on Atari.
effex.........  8o % - No tunnels, hehe! Nice mix, but a bit buggy (the envmap).
grafix........  75 % - Using STgfx in a F-demo isn't the best choice. But Good.
musix.........  75 % - Stomping technoing stuff, matches to the demo.
design........  7o % - Not much design, except the point of the good atmosphere!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  74 % - Where is the first big demo at all?!
