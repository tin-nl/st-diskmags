ñ...better late than never...

A late review in comparison with the other  stuffs in this magazine, but because
I liked and still like DUNE demos  very much I decided to review it anyway, even
if all other did it already. I do it for my own pleasure... it's the curse of
any magazine editor I think, to review anything he get's in his fingers...

So, here we go... I don't remember right what demo was the last one from DUNE on
the Atari ST, but if I remember right it was the demo ò"FAITH"ð, released somewhen
in 1994, as the big collapse of the ST scene happened.

Since  then nothing  was seen anymore by òDUNEð, upsi... false... there  was still
one big  demo left, called ñ"ILLUSIONS"ð, a 3disk  megatrackmo, shown on the óPLACE
ó2 BE TOO Partyð, held 1995 in  France, but this demo  saw never the  light of day
because òEVIL METALð don't  wanted to release  the party version  of it and so the
freax never saw a bit by òDUNEð again :(

Some of them appeared  there and then but it seemed as óDUNEð was dead and because
I think òDUNEð was one of the biggest creators  of design dentros  and trackmos on
the ST in the nineties it was a big loss too...

Untill  now... Suddenly òDUNEð striked  back! They  checked the  revival of the ST
demo  scene and  contributed, as  the most  others at  first with  an old, never
released thing, this ñ"PARADISE"ð dentro, which was thought for release at the end
of 1994 but never matched it to leave óCHUCKð's disx...

It isn't a big file at all and so I think it's  one of their  trackmos again and
started it...
Yeah! Nineties oldschool! At first the black screen was filled  by two big white
vectorboxes to give  the look onto a  kewl òDUNEð logo  by óMICð. Accompanied with a
nice chipsound with blippbloppers it brought back some old feelings, hmmmmm...

A white door opens the screen for the next thing.
Ok... 2 small  vector signs (the sketched  greece delta  for òDUNEð) were  turning
around in the lower left corner meanwhile a one-plane -present- logo  cames from
the right  sight and distorts  a bit, to  scroll out  again and show  up a great
ñPARADISEð logo, by óMICð again...

At next a  simple vector spaceship is  coming up, flying  through a dots tunnel,
and after that, again  with a nice  transition, the screen is filled up by small
pics of  Marilyn Monroe and those start to scroll and distort a bit  meanwhile a
gelee vector appears, jumping and disting a bit in front of the Monroe dister.

Again  a white  vector shape  guides us to the  next thing, a simple  picture of
Santa Claus, painted  by JADE  and saying Merry Xmas. That  is removed  from the
screen and it goes on with a nice òDUNEð logo  on the right side of the screen and
on the left side several stuff comes up  like shaded and mirrored  splines and a
vectorbox with a starfield in it, both shaded too.

{*i paradis1.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

And it goes on with  a comic styled  picture on the  left side and  a gelee ball
jumping around  on the screen, mirrored and with stars mapped on it... kewl  and
reminds hard to the marvellous ñ"FLIP-O"ð demo by òOXYGENEð and òDIAMOND DESIGNð.

{*i paradis2.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

Ok, slowly the  demo comes to  its end. At first  two glas  vectors are  turning
their round on the left side of the  screen, meanwhile an old  contact adress is
shown on the right side... next is a small dotslandscape in black and white (and
grey scales), accompanied with the greetings scroller.

This stuff  disappears and the credits coming up, presented nice as always, with
small comic look-a-like faces for the different contributors  of the demo. Those
pictures came in via a vector shape, flying around and staying on  the screen to
fade over to the pictures. Some nice comments appearing to every credit...

Ok, last but  not least  a picture  by óBABARð  is coming  up, showing a  devil or
something like that and all ends with an ENDlogo, built of vector shapes, flying
around on the screen and it's delayed again.

End... via pressing space you are jumping back to the desktop  without any bombs
or something! Nice! Time to start it again...

The last words...

Nice dentro  but it  feels a bit old, but  what do you  expect from  5 years old
stuff? It reminds hard to the last days of the old ST scene in 1993/1994, as the
most stylish  demos were released. But don't expect a smash  demo like "FLIP-O",
òDUNEð never  released a  demo like this, but they always  tried to  create Amiga-
style demos and did their job very well.
This demo  is ñreal nostalgicð  if you just view the effex, on  the other hand the
design beats the most actual demos on ST without  any problem. The  grafix are a
ñreal messð, óMICð was  one of  the gods with 16 colours, his comic styled  pics and
logos had always a ñhigh levelð.
The chip music  with it's  blipblopps is nice but ñnervesð with the time... sorry.
Anyway, overall it's a demo you should get if you still have a ST running!

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  6o % - Even in the time of 1994 it wasn't a hype... oldskool.
effex.........  65 % - Not much and nothing revolutionary, even for 1994.
grafix........  8o % - MIC at his best! Also the other gfx mens did kewl stuff.
musix.........  65 % - A nice track but too short and looped -> nerves!
design........  75 % - Good oldschool design, beats many actual demos!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  69 % - The style of 1993/1994...
