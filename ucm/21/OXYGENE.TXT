Heja, without any doubt this  demo was the most promising release on the STNICCC
party in December last year. No one expected it because  it wasn't announced and
suddenly ñOXYGENEð striked back, just after they have released  an updated version
of their ñ"NOSTALGIC-O DEMO"ð Furthermore it was the only  demo that was released
right on the party... oldschool rules :)

It is the first time that I'm happy about the fact to  own an Atari STE as well,
because their new demo, just  called ñ"STNICCC 2ooo"ð is thought  for this machine
mainly, even if it would run on STfm without music, but since it features a kewl
(even if it is an old one) soundtrack, taken from an Amiga demo by Kefrens.

Ok, I connected the STe to my monitor and switched  it on... After short loading
time the  screen turns  into blue  and the  saying "This is ó*not*ð a Falcon demo"
appears on the screen, built  up of point  sprites or dots  or something. In the
same moment the soundtrack starts  to play, a kewl oldschool  one, you know that
Amiga demo  with the  saw?! :) It  is  called ñ"Desert Dream"ð and a  ruling Amiga
old school one, featuring loads of 3d stuff.
Hum, I dunno  but that  intro sequence reminds  me to some ST demo, but  I don't
really remember what demo.

Ok, the screen scrolls down and several moving dots stuff appears on the screen,
just like  a 3d starfield, sinus waves  and spheres, followed  by a STNICCC logo
and after that an Oxygene logo  as well. Both are pixeled  in a strange style by
Mon originally for that demo.

The Oxygene logo changes into a complex 3d vector, saying Oxygene, in yellow and
orange colours. Cool. It is turning around a while and then  you're going to fly
into that vector through a  small vector  tunnel. This is the main effect of the
demo. You're on a long  flight through  vector tunnels and  rooms, sometimes the
vector stuff  is animated as  well. Without  any doubt  it is  the most  complex
filled vector stuff released in a ST demo so far, at least as I remember.

After you  left the  tunnels a big  complex are built  of several  filled vector
cubes comes up and then you're colliding with one, the screen flashes and you're
coming into the credits part.

That one is cool styled as well. In one part of the  screen you can see parts of
the vector  tunnels (animated!) and besides them  the credits  and later  on the
greetings are displayed.
The whole thing is followed by a picture showing Asterix and Obelix, accompanied
with the names of the  makers, óLeonardð and óMonð. This screen  stays onto your STe
untill you press reset.

That's it... I started the demo several times  again and again, untill I decided
to stop here and write the final words...

The final words...

This surprising demo release really  kicks ass, but in another  way as expected.
It just  features  oldschool stuff, filled vectors  and 3d dots. No  tunnels, no
fire, mapping or anything  else. But as  well as ò"EKO System"ð on Falcon it  just
impressed through  the massive use  of those  filled 3d vectors, that  remind to
some 3d movie. It is the first demo on STe that features  such an impressive use
of those vectors, even if the machine slows down  a bit from time to time. Maybe
the vectors done  by Holocaust were bigger, but this is the  longest 3d sequence
on ST so far...
Furthermore the  soundtrack by Laxity hypes the demo a bit more, it is a genious
module and found its right place in this demo. The pixel score  is good as well,
even if Mon features a strange style this time.
I just have one point to mourn  about a bit, the  design. Ok, the chosen colours
are quiet ok and several transitions breaking the frontiers of the single parts,
but it could be a bit more...
Anyway, a nice demo, and without any doubt the ruling ST(e) demo  in 2ooo... Get
it and run it on STe instead of an emulation!

originality...  85 % - EKO system for STe users!
effex.........  75 % - masses of filled vectors, 3d dots stuff...
grafix........  75 % - pixelwork by Mon is quiet ok, strange style...
musix.........  8o % - old but rocking module sound!
design........  65 % - nice colours, some good transitions
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  76 % - stunning 3d stuff... THE 3d demo for STe!

Ok, ñOxygeneð, we're waiting for more :)
