ó[] What has happened?

The past  twelve months brought  many many changes to the world aswell as to our
group.  There was a time...  back in 1999 when I announced  to quit òtSCcð  and no
signs of life from other members of the crew showed up.  Later on in summer 1999
I started with one of the  biggest projects that were  ever  done  in the  óAtarið
scene and surely  the biggest  project of  our group.  I speak  about the  giant
óFADING TWILIGHTð archive (òhttp://tscc.atari.org/fadtwilg.htmlð). This brought some
new life into the group above all  I seemed to motivate the coders to do atleast
on ñPC ðsome work for this archive.

I was at a point were  I  could accept  that some of the  coders left the  óAtarið
system and are now working  on "other machines".  I was at a  point were I got a
more  open minded  view of a democrew and  WHAT  is really  important.  I had no
concrete  plans about  the future of our  group.  I just wanted  to have  a good
platform  to release the  òFADING TWILIGHTð project.  It was also about  that time
when I asked óMoondog/PoDð  to join our forces as  graphicsman but  he refused  to
join first.  In march  2000  we spoke  again about  that  topic  and he  agreed.

During the year 2000 some more new members should join our forces. In june óGizmoð
from ñiCEBiRDð joined us as another graphicsman. Around the same time òtSCcð entered
the ASCII-Scene with the first colly from me.  In october a new coder joined our
ranks called ñRAYð and our newest member is called óUNSEEN FATEð from Finland. He is
also a graphisman. óWE STILL NEED ATARI CODERSð!

In the middle of last year òMoondogð decided to take over the abandoned óUNDERCOVER
óMAGASCENEð again. I really liked the idea but on the other hand  I didn't want to
piss  off  òST Survivorð again.  Therefore I want to  point out that  òTHIS  IS  NO
òCONSPIRACY  AGAINST  STS AND ALIVEð! Well... my motivation  for  writing articles
didn't came back during the last months so my contribution to  ANY  mag wouldn't
be so big anymore. I concentrate myself on  ascii-styling and chipping nowadays.

UPDATE: In february 2oo1 a new member joined our team called óCREATURE XLð.  He is
a  coder  on  ñAtari 800 XLð,  òSTð  and  óFALCONð. Finally we found some more coders!

ó[] THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE!

We once said that we won't spread any  infos about our  projects anymore...  you
know? óNO PROMISES NO DEMANDSð... but I will tell you about some products that are
obviously under construction:

- MORE ñUNDERCOVER MAGS
- óFADING TWILIGHTð CD-ROM excerpt 2, 3 and 4
- òRAYð is working on a óWOLF3Dð clone for ST... maybe this one will also be
  released later on this year

Well, I can't tell you anything else coz there is nothing else that is sure yet.
