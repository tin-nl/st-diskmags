in a dark night you were born
in a dark place you were torn
out of a mother without sin
the points were set you couldn't win
they tried to save you out of her womb
it will mean your grave and your tomb
you leave this earth before you know
to god's arbitrariness you have to bow
condemned to suffer and die in the dark
there's no paradise that is worth to embark

ñthere's no paradise

with high hopes she tried to give eternal life
but now the little worm is dead without a life
don't be sad this is the way
that all creatures have to go on their last day
to god's arbitrariness you have to bow
with no consciousness nothing to know
will we ever meet again, will we suffer endlessly
we are lost in universe we are lost eternally.

ò...editorial...

So here it is for you, óUNDERCOVER MAGASCENE ISSUE 21ð... moondog on the keys...

Some old  saying says: ñ"They'll never come back."ð but as you  can see, sometimes
they do so  and so it's time to start the second undead series of the óUNDERCOVER
óMAGASCENE...

You can't  imagine how  I felt and  how I laughed  after  I red  statements like
"Alive - the last diskmag  written in english" or "Undercover ist  tot - Es lebe
Alive"... Ok, UNDERCOVER was thought to be dead, by the people who maintained it
after my quit back in 1999.

But why not bring something  back to life? And why I and the .tSCc. chaps should
not try the impossible? Sometimes I think óUNDERCOVERð died really with my quit as
main editor and  so it's not too strange that the current magazine "ALIVE!" that
was called to  be the successor of óUNDERCOVERð and ñMAGGIEð looks more like the UCM
after my quit and not  like a completely new magazine... but UCM 16 to 2o didn't
looked like the UCM's before...

There seems to be  no big break, nothing completely new, because  with STsuvivor
as main editor of the UCM there was already created something new. Anyway, after
all I think I'm the only one who can let the UCM die and I decided to go on with
the magazine, to stop  my own project  called ...inSTabil... and to try out what
will happen if UCM would come back again.

Believe me, it was a hard job to hide all this ambitions and so óUNDERCOVER # 21ð,
first issue of  the second undead series, is more or less a complete .tSCc. only
release. We're still  using the UCM shell, as ò"ALIVE!"ð is doing  as well, but to
set accents we had to do a bit more out of the possibilities EARXs shell offers.

In the future  we will accept  any contribution  again, this .tSCc. only release
was born  out of our "undercover activities" and not  thought as UCM politics in
the future. So if you  want to give us  a hand, in writing articles, doing musix
or designing some grafix or even an intro, don't hesitate to contact us!

Furthermore we're  interested in  your comments about  that comeback, about that
issue, your  wishes, dreams  and thoughts. Any comment  will be  released in the
next issue that is already in preperation.

Ok people, enough words of that... ...inSTabil... is born dead and óUNDERCOVERð is
still alive (!)... so go on and dive into the abyss of óUNDERCOVERð...


                                             moondog & the .tSCc. posse in o4/o1
