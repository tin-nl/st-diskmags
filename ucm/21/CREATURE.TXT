 INTERVIEW WITH:                     ÒCREATURE XL / THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Recently some new members  joined ÛtSCc and I wanna introduce them to the  puplic
a little bit more.


ÚUCM: Hi Creature.  Let us start with  some usual  questions. How  did you  start
Ú     computing and what systems are you on now?

ÒCXL: My math-teacher asked me to calculate  the faculty of 100. I tried it  with
Ò     Atari Basic.  That was my first proggy I ever wrote.  Then I wanted to make
Ò     a game... and so I learned assembler...



ÚUCM: Why do you call yourself CREATURE XL?

ÒCXL: In the  year 1992 or 1993 I wanted  to convert  the  game 'Creatures II' to
Ò     the 8-Bit ATARI  and after month of loading 'creature.src' in the assembler
Ò     I identified myself a lot with  this project, so I choosed it as my pseudo.
Ò     The 'XL'-part is ofcourse from  the 'Atari 800XL' to show that this is  THE
Ò     computer.



ÚUCM: How did you became a member of TSCC?

ÒCXL: As I started  coding on the Falcon I  realised that it is very hard  to get
Ò     things going.  Then I heard that  MC LASER (tscc) is searching  for coders.
Ò     That  was the chance  to get hints from  experienced folks and I joined.  I
Ò     hope I can soon code something _useful_.



ÚUCM: What do you define as 'useful'? :-)

ÒCXL: Demoscreens or the like.



ÚUCM: Why do you code on Atari 8 bit?

ÒCXL: Because I know this computer by heart and it is really easy.



ÚUCM: Do you have any current projects? What can we expect in the future?

ÒCXL: A game for the 8-Bit.
Ò     In the future? Some 68k-code.



ÚUCM: Maybe we will see a Atari8 demo from tSCc someday?

ÒCXL: Don't know. It's a nice  idea, but  ATM I  want to  code some games.  It is
Ò     really hard to code demos like the polish guys do.



ÚUCM: Please name five of your fave demos.

ÒCXL: Sonolumineszenz
Ò     Eko-System
Ò     Asskicker (XL)
Ò     Shoel (XL)



ÚUCM: Please name five of your fave games.

ÒCXL: Giana Sisters (C64)
Ò     International Karate (XL)



ÚUCM: What do you think  about the  latest  discussions  on the  DHS-board  about
Ú     showing C64-Demos on an atari-party?

ÒCXL: At first  such a discussion  should  take place  on  the EIL-Board. We have
Ò     seen that some folks  feel the _OLD_ 'ATARI vs. COMODORE'-Spirit,  but that
Ò     didn't fit in the time  we're living in.  Further it is really interesting,
Ò     at least for me, to see what the  C64-hackers are  doing on their machines.



ÚUCM: How does it come that you code your Atari 8 bit stuff on a Falcon?

ÒCXL: It is anoying for me to code  on a 40-Byte  screen and ST-Texteditors,  qed
Ò     for example,  are more comfortable.  The cross-assembler (ca65) has  a huge
Ò     amount  of directives which  makes coding easier  and not to forget you can
Ò     use   the   'make'-utillity   where   you   can  control  projects  easier.



ÚUCM: What do you think about the future of  the demoscene  in general?  In which
Ú     direction are we heading to?

ÒCXL: The demoscene  lives from competition and there is not really a competition
Ò     in the scene - but there should be  six Falcon demos today at EIL2 ;-). But
Ò     one Atari-Party in a year is not so much.



ÚUCM: What do you think of Multi-platform democrews, like for example Haujobb who
Ú     are doing demos on PC, Amiga, C64 and Playstation?

ÒCXL: It's  interesting, BUT they should  concentrate on one  platform to improve
Ò     their skills on that.



ÚUCM: So we are at the end. Any final words?

ÒCXL: I LOVE INTERVIEWS ;-)


Thanx for your time.
