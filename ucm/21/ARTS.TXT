Here comes another ST intro, better an invitation intro, done for the ARTS PARTY
which was  supposed to be held in France in September this year. This  intro was
released on the VIP 2 (Very Important Party), held in France too.

"ARTS" is the  follow up to the RTS party series held in 1998/1999 and organized
as oldschool party  by CFI, SUPREMACY and SECTOR ONE. The  intro was done by the
TYPHOON people, who now are firming under SUPREMACY only, as it seems. The main-
coder is STRIDER, who  was known as THE BEAST for  many years  before he changed
his pseudonym, for more or less creative GFA snippets.

That intro starts  with a very simple  menue, showing  3 boxes in  dark red on a
black background. Here you can choose your  language as the box on  top says and
you can  choose between  french and english, just while using  the mouse. So far
there isn't anything cool or something.

After clicking onto "english" ofcourse (just because the froggies language isn't
so easy :) ...) the  screen shrinks to the middle and  a nice chip  music by 5o5
starts to play (where the hell I know it from?!). At next follows a  logo in the
way of the parental advisories, saying year 2ooo Advisory, excessive hype... how
right they are...

The next part is dominated by a simple effect, showing a clock made of line vex,
running slowly backwards. It starts to run faster and faster, broken  by showing
pictures  with the topic of  clocks, just made  by SPAZ of  The Lost Boys (taken
from their "Ooh Crickey..." demo) and others. Finally  a rendered  clock appears
on the right side and on the left side  the info is  coming up  that this is the
invitation demo for the RETURN TO THE SOURCE party 2K, short known as "ARTS Y2K"
that was happening in autumn and was co-organized by the Atari groups SECTOR ONE
and SUPREMACY, as two  already known logos by EDO (for SECTOR ONE) and MADE (for
SUPREMACY) show.

The next  part is coming  up, it's a simple med-res textdisplayer  where you can
scroll up  and down the info file for the  party. This part got  a new music, by
5o5 again and features a 2 colours aRTS Y2K logo on the lower part of the screen
that looks quite mediocre... In this part you can read all  about the party, the
competitions, the rules and even the credits for this invitation intro.

After pressing space the demo turns back to the desktop...

Final words... not much to say, just  an invitation  intro that  does his job. I
can't say much about it, just because except  the line vector  clock there isn't
much on effex included, several fading routs and a textdisplayer, that's all.
The musix  by 5o5 rocking really, as  always, but the  rest isn't  impressing at
all, esp. the  SUPREMACY logo  by MADE, it's a nice  one, without any doubt, was
used to much now and it's time to find some people to draw some new ones...
So what? It's just an invitation intro, nothing for demo watchers at all.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  1o % - nothing special, not even original gfx or musix
effex.........  2o % - just some line vectors stuff, fading routs
grafix........  75 % - mainly nice grafix, but already seen before
musix.........  85 % - real good sid tunes, but also not used the 1st time
design........  1o % - few fading stuff, no real transitions or designish colors
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  4o % - this rating lives just from the music and grafix...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I really  wonder how many  mediocre intro's by SUPREMACY will  follow untill the
first real production...
