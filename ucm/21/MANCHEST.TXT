At the  ñAlternative Party 2Kð, held this summer, this new band  striked back with
their second Falcon demo this year. After they were a  mystery after the release
of their ó"MAHABRABBEL..."ð demo in the  beginning  of 2K they  now revealed their
roots and so I just want to write some lines  about ñFITð itself  before reviewing
the demo at all.

ñFITð is a group that was founded in the early  nineties and was  at home on other
systems, just like the PC scene. Later on the members of the band found out that
it makes fun to be present on several systems, and so they created demos for DOS
and later also òLINUXð. Now they discovered  the Falcon and with the  help of some
finish ex-sceners, like the guys of ñTHE ADMIRABLESð, they started the first steps
into the Falcon demo scene. So their first demo appeared in the beginning of the
year and  was a mentionable effort. Ok, it wasn't  a  smash hit but anyone could
see that the people  behind the demo were all  others than just  newbies in demo
coding at all...

And in record time  they smashed  their second demo  together, with the  help of
several other  freaks from  other systems and  bands... As written  above it was
released on the óALTERNATIVE partyð and given in the óWILD COMPOð.

Enough craptalk... time for the review!

The first  bits are  presented with some drumming tracker  music, displaying the
makers of the demo with a white font  on black background but  nice fading in fx
and it is followed by the intro  picture, displaying the strange  title with the
heads of two ostrichs on a colourful background... very weird...

This intro picture zooms in and goes  over to the next  effect, a picture to pic
zoomer, displaying the head of a woman in blue colours. Nice effect, but nothing
special at all, and because zooming seems to be in  in Finland, a Fractal zoomer
comes up, after that... huuuu! I don't remember right when  I saw the last frac-
zoomer on Falcon... It's an oldschool-trip, eh?!

It goes on  with another, newer effect, showing  that sun-rays-look-a-like thing
again. Nice, but always seen before in  other demos. This  effect is followed by
another picture, showing the head of a woman with some fishy  stuff, accompanied
or better overlayed with some letters, displayed in that nice fading effect like
in the intro... designish ;)

{*i manse.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

That picture fades out in a quiet cool way again and  what follows? A zoom! Wow!
It is the ópicture-to-picture-zoomerð again, this time a small version of the zoom
comes  up in the lower right corner, that features again a smaller zoomer and so
on... Nice idea, seen on other systems before...

After that the  best effect, but not  revolutionary  at all, comes up, showing a
phongshaded duck  on a very colourful background. Ok, just want to explain why I
wrote ñ"not revolutionary"ð... I  know, even today not  many people  are trying to
include  phongshading  in their demos, but as I remember  right the  first steps
into this effecs were already done in 1995 or 1996...

And with  another nice  transition  a new picture comes up  again, showing  some
flowers and the back of a woman. That was nearly all, because there are just the
credits left, displayed by the nice fading effect used in the intro as well. And
after showing the creds the demo jumps back to the desktop... Finito...

Hmmm... After the demo ended I felt as I had  some flashback... wont  write much
more here, will go over straight to the...

last words...

óFITð matched  it to present a  second Falcon-demo, just a  half year  after their
first demo on  Falcon at all. But they had to pay a big price for that! What big
price? ñ"MANCHESTER SCHWARTZWURST"ð leaves  to me the  impression to  be be just a
remix of their first demo, nearly the same  effecs, the same  transitions of the
pictures as  well. Ok, some stuffs are nice, like some used fade  routines, that
give a few points more  to the design, the pictures aren't  bad as well, but I'm
no big fan of photoshopped stuff.
The  musix are some strange  drum'n'noise  stuff, not my  taste, but  tastes are
different, as you know.
Anyway, it isn't a bad demo, but the remix-idea in my head lowers the aha-effect
a lot... Ok, we will see in their next strike if they have also new ideas...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  5o % - Seems to be a remix of another demo...
effex.........  65 % - No new but good done effex, zoomer, phong...
grafix........  65 % - Nice looking, but photoshop-a-like
musix.........  65 % - Strange soundtrack... but matches in some way to the demo
design........  6o % - Some quiet good fading and transition ideas, but not more
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  61 % - Hmmm, not a big step from the last try to this one...
