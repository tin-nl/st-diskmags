A new year should bring new releases and especially new demos... and here is one
fresh and free from Finland, by a fresh and free new team, simply called ñFITð.
They called their contribution for the new millenium ó"Mahabharata"ð... huuuu...
This name  surely is one of the strangest in the Fo3o demo history, no question,
and so I'm  interested in the  things ñFITð will bring us in such  a strange named
demo...

I clicked on the file and after a short time a breaking music with indic samples
started to play and the picture of an indian goddess appeared on the screen with
the title of the demo. Aha, therefore the strange name...
The picture is fading out with  an wellknown and not very  spectacular whirlpool
effect, turning  the screen colour back to a stylish black again. Yo! We're back
in the early  nineties when words like "style" and "design" weren't known by the
Falcon community and fade to black was state of the art...

Anyway... the demo  goes on with a  sunny effect, you know these things, looking
like a  sun spreading rays  over the  screen, and  this comes along  with indian
letters stomped on the screen  in the rhythm of  the music... I remember this of
so many other demos, esp. on PC where just chinese letters where used... but eh,
what  message is  laying behind  those  letters? Not  everyone is  used to be an
Indian? Is there a deeper  thought behind them  at all? I think  not and if yes,
please inform me... hehe...

Ok, after the  usual black break, another picture of an  indian goddness appears
on the  screen and rays of light were spreaded from her head  and hands... looks
nice but don't matched it to make me euphoric...

Again blackness is filling my screen and... uuuuuh... long time no see! A simple
zoomer is going to fill up my screen! ñYuuuuuuð! Ah... stop... the little picture,
you surely  know what, zoomes back and back  and back and more and more of those
pics, but with other colours are building up a new, other picture, showing again
some indian stuff... hmmm...
Nice effect, not  brainblasting but the point that another pic is created by the
out-zoomed ones gives it a small bonus and so it's for me the best effect of the
demo so far... and unfortunately it will be... :(

...black... the sunny  effect again, again the zoomer with other  motives and an
end screen, made  of a nice picture (surely made with photshop or something) and
giving the credits, comming after this... and swush... we're back on the desk...

Aha... that was  ñMahabrababrabbelbrabbelð... I'm a bit disappointed to see such a
demo in  the year 2ooo... maybe it's an original  idea to fill up  a demo with a
bunch of indian feelings like pics and musix, but overall it's not even mediocre
on the technical  side. The progress on the Falcon demo scene was too big in the
last years that I could  close one eye and say, ok... no way.
And  because it is so damn old fashioned I'm disturbed a lot more. At this point
I'm wondering  why, because I  can remember  that òSTURMð, at his óADMIRABLESð times
released  a bit more stylish  things on ST. Ok, he just did the "core" (what the
hell?) but  he seems to  be involved somehow  in the group and so  why he kicked
this stuff together in such a loveless way?

Hmmm... more? The grafix... dunno  what to say, not the stuff I like at all esp.
because the most seem to be digized or scanned and I'm not  a big friend of this
ñPhotoshop-look-a-like-stuffð... sorry.
The musix? Goes  really onto  my nerves with  the time, sometimes  sounds like a
a ñlooped  sampleð, not like a real soundtrack. Ok, it matches to the style of the
demo at  all but don't hit my taste... but he, that's nearly impossible I guess,
hehe...

The last words...

Nice to  see a new band on the Falcon scene, no question, but  it seems as  they
smashed together this demo as fast as possible, not as good as possible, because
words like design and style seem to be lost in the finish woods and lakes.
I'm waiting for the second try and hope for more!

originality...  7o % - The first indian demo on the Falcon!
effex.........  5o % - Just a few, not state of the art, but a nice zoomer.
grafix........  6o % - Some digitized stuff, hand drawing seems to be out?
musix.........  65 % - Matches to the demo but goes onto my nerves!
design........  3o % - What design? Black breaks and some whirling fadings!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  55 % - Nice try, but just mediocre... better luck next time!
