The never ending story was finished?! Yep, finally...

Today (17.3.) I  got a mail containing the final version of ñ"CENTAURI"ð, .tSCc.'s
contribution  to the ó"STNICCC2k C64 TIMES REVISITED COMPETITION"ð (what the hell)
that just means that the contributions don't have to be bigger than 38 KB...

As known, our intro ñ"CENTAURI"ð reached just the second and last place against an
ORIC intro  done by  DBUG. Maybe just  known to the  sirius guys, the  intro was
announced to be ready latest at XMAS... but  nothing happened. And the time goes
bye and nothing was in sight.

Untill  now, and you  can believe me, I was  anxious to see that  thingie all my
group mates were  talking about but  I never saw a byte  of. Furthermore I hoped
for some brainblasting stuff because 6 people  were involved in it, wow! Even if
I don't know how many people  we will need to make a big demo then, I packed the
thingie onto a disk and started to check it out on my STe.

ñCENTAURIð starts with the  boot'n'ready  sequence of  the C64, saying 38611 bytes
RAM free, loading ñCENTAURIð. A sid music by òMC Laserð starts to play and the first
effect comes up, a texture mapped tunnel, not  filling the  whole screen, with a
small tSCc logo in the upper left corner. Quiet ok, but with the time the tunnel
mania on ST should has reached its peak long times ago...

{*i centaur2.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

Anyway, it goes on  with a Centauri logo, bumpmapped in yellow/red colours, also
good looking but we've seen it before as well but it makes place for a nicer efx
then, an environment  mapped vector  thingie, accompanied by  some girlish pixel
works by òGIZMOð. This is surely  the top-effect of the intro, because  it is more
or less the last one.

{*i centauri.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

Last but not least the credits part comes  up, listing the  involved people with
some  dark blue hexagonal vector areas  that turning  around in the  background.
Then the music goes over  into a steady  buzzing noise  and after pressing space
the intro turns back to GEM (locking up the Falcon btw...).

That's it and I don't want to wait too long for the final words...

ò...the last words...

This small intro is a nice life sign  from our band, no  question, but it surely
isn't the burner  someone maybe was waiting for. It  features several nice "new-
school-effex" but doesn't blows any  brain away. Ok, there are  just 38 KB space
and if you think  to music and pixel work, there isn't much you could include at
all, but I for myself thought I would see a bit more. The musical score is quiet
nice and I like it more than MC Laser's tune for the ñ"Apocalypse"ð demo. The grfx
are ok too. Last but not least I have to mention that I miss some more design.
There is some fading stuff but no real transitions at all... òmeuh!
Well, just leech it somewhere and check it out...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  7o % - not a blast, mostly already seen stuff.
effex.........  75 % - tunnel, bumpmapper, nice environment mapped vectors!
grafix........  65 % - some pixeled stuff, quiet ok.
musix.........  8o % - good chip tune.
design........  6o % - colours and fading is ok, but I miss a lot more...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  7o % - A nice comeback for .tSCc....

.tSCc.  like the phoenix from the ashes                                  moondog
