Yes, the chaps  of the DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY took part in the big ST demo revival
of 1999 too, not only with their stunning demo called "SWEETY" from the ERROR IN
LINE PARTY in april, no, after diverse  presentation intros for the competitions
held on their homepage, they took part in their latest  competition as well, the
XMAS Intro competition.

With "TWO IN ONE" they wanted to put two demo styles into one intro, giving some
stuff  to the oldschooler  and the newschoolers  as well. At least  they claimed
that in the readme file.

Before running the demo it got the first big bonus point  because it's a quality
release, that means it  runs on nearly  any machine  from ST up to the Falcon. I
don't know  about clones, but  if you have 1MB of RAM on your ST, and  all other
machines in this range should have it anyways, this demo is for you!

The file is  fairly big and it is the biggest XMAS intro from 1999 at all and so
you can be sure to get a load of stuff...

Right after  starting the  intro a nice  chipmusic done by  DMA SC of SECTOR ONE
starts  to play, followed by  a line  vector object, a doubled  pyramid on black
background. This comes  along with  the words "some like the old style". Oha, so
that is the first part?

At next a delayed texture tunnel comes up, accompanied with the  info that there
are some people  prefer the  new style and after all both effex coming mixed up,
with the point that the tunnel is swinging from left to  right too. Yo, and they
are giving us both... maybe to get points of the old- and newschool posse? ;)

Right after this a nice scanned title picture, showing some elks in a bar, while
santa claus  is searching  for them, comes up... and  it goes  on with  the best
effect in my eyes... the whole picture comes up in bumpmapped style again! Yeps,
that's cool! And until now they surely have beaten all other intros...

But DHS aren't still on the end... at next several objects made  of vector balls
coming up that are bouncing in  gelee formations onto the borders of the screen.
And this is followed by a fancy colourful newschool effect, some strange colour-
cycling stuff, dunno how to call it in the right way, but looks marvellous.

At next  some DHS logo  appears on  the top of the screen and again  line vector
stuff, this  time delayed ones, are presented  below the  logo. Yo, feed for all
the oldschoolers again, hehe.

And finally the last effect, on a dark blue background, some rotating  and again
delayed star tunnel  comes up, overlayed by  a vertical scroller  that gives the
credits, greetings and usual craptak... Nice...

Finally you're going back to the desktop while smashing the spacebar... kewl...

I must say  that I runned  the demo again and  again, especially  because I also
liked  DMA SC's  musical work very much, a nice chipping  sound that isn't  very
overloaded with queeeking sid stuff... And so we're going to write some...

Final words...

"TWO IN ONE" is one of the most impressive releases of the outgoing year of 1999
in my eyes. It feeds  all tastes of demolovers, bringing some  standard oldie fx
together with new stuff like tunnels, bumpmapps or this crazy colour burst.
There isn't  much stuff  on the grafix side, just one  pixeled logo  of mediocre
style, one funny but scanned picture and font's without any highs and deeps...
The design... hmmm... there isn't  much, mainly black  backgrounds  and fadings,
just one thing to mention here, the flashy transition between  the title picture
and the following bumpmapper, nice done.
Last but not  least the musical score... nice soundtrack, slowly  chipping along
through the whole demo, doesn't goes onto your nerves... nice.
All in all the best Xmas intro done in 1999 and one of the best releases of 1999
in my eyes as  well, even if it doesn't features a blast  of originality  but it
rocks anyway...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  7o % - Nice idea to mix up old & new school...
effex.........  8o % - Several old and new effex, bump, tunnel, line vex
grafix........  65 % - Just one pixeled logo, kewl scanned pic...
musix.........  8o % - Good chipping musix, no nerve-factor
design........  7o % - Some good transitions, could have been better...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  73 % - A hi-lite between all the resurrected oldschool stuff!
