                               INTO THE MIX?

Meuh together!

Yep, you finally  found them! In this part you will find all the reviews I wrote
for the never  released ...inSTabil... diskmagazine. You will find  in here just
the reviews, all other articles I wrote for ...inSTabil... that aren't depending
on a special time for release are mixed up with the new ones in  the other parts
of the magazine.

There  is a  simple reason for  this, untill late  August 2ooo the  magazine was
thought to be ...inSTabil... and because  I started on  this project  already in
late autumn 1999 (Yes!) but never  reached a semi-final state I  collected a lot
of articles with the time.

As we heard  that UCM will be  stopped and we  decided to  take it over again to
save it for the scene I got the problem that all those  articles were fairly old
in comparison  with the already released UCM's and  furthermore already released
by other writers in older issues of the UCM, maintained by STS.

So I had  to choices... delete all the work I already  had done or  release them
anyway. I took  the second choice, esp. because several people  are still surely
interested in my view on those thingies... bahhhh! ;)

So I reworked those articles into the new design of the current UCM and released
them anyway. But I decided to put at least  the reviews I did  into this special
corner

Sure, some  people will think now that I just want to blow up  the current issue
of the UCM, but if you think that there are just 2o articles taken over from the
...inSTabil... project and  you compare this with the number of  articles at all
you should see that we don't needed it at all...


...tSCc... 2ooo and beyond                                               moondog
