!THE! party event  of the coming year will be the second ERROR IN LINE party for
sure... even the first one, back in 1999 was the most interesting european Atari
scene meeting  since the  SILICONVENTION back  in 1997 or  maybe since  the last
FRIED BITS party, back in 1995.

Better, the  last years ERROR IN LINE was  maybe  the best and  most interesting
event I ever met  since I'm  going to  Atari scene  parties. There  were several
reasons for this. The first parties I was on, suffered a bit from the organizers
qualities and  the attendies, the  following always  left some  impression to be
surrounded by elitist Independent freax that didn't care  about newcomers. Later
events were grown up to multi machines parties with high nerve factors.

So just the ERROR IN LINE is left  to be called a great  party in all views. The
people, the atmosphere  and not to forget the kewl ST demo revival were things I
have to  mention here, no gamers, no suckers, just nearly the  whole active core
of the nowadays Atari scene.

And such a big event needs a follow up and since the organizers took their whole
encourage  together, we  will have  a new  ERROR IN LINE next year. And  what is
better to announce such a party as a stunning invitro?!

This  time the vikings  from the north  did it again, means the  DEAD HACKERS or
better EVIL and GIZMO. As  it seems they've found their  purpose in doing little
but mostly stunning  intros after  their demo-overkill in 1997/1998. Furthermore
it is very  interesting to  see them  kicking the ST  again and  again to higher
results.

At first  I have to mention that the  intro's are nearly the same, but trying to
make the best of  the used hardware. So the colours on ST were reduced to 16, so
such as the  background graphix, pictures and logo. Furthermore the ST brings us
a chip music, leaning  on the Falcon's  soundtrack. I'm  writing this  because I
don't want to write two reviews for both versions.

Ok, the demo starts showing a colourful background picture (reduced to blue colz
on ST) and a  vertical  scroller, coming from right to left  and left  to right,
lightning  up as both scrollers meet. That looks  really cool, nice idea. On the
Falcon there is the plus that the background isn't clipped out behind the scroll
and shining throught the scroller.

After that some photos, taken from the last years ERROR IN LINE party are shown,
surely to  make you more anxious for  the party, to  remind the  people who were
already there last year, to  the great times they had and  to force them to come
back to Dresden next year. On ST the photo's are shown in blue-grey shades.

At next an evironment mapped EIL logo made of vectors is turning  it's rounds on
the screen, as well on the ST again, just with reduced colours and lower res.
And  than the colours  of the vector are darkening a  bit, the ERROR logo, known
from the last years party scrolls in and gives place in the middle of the screen
for an information  text you can scroll up and down. This text features just the
main information about  the party. The real invitation text is  included as file
in both versions.

After pressing space the intro turns back to the desktop, in both versions. Wont
write more and will go over to the last words...

DHS did it again... they're releasing not much, but what  they do is mostly kewl
stuff, no  question, esp. for the stuff  that was  fast hacked  together just as
those two intros. The nicest idea is the scroller stuff in my eyes, looks really
good and gives the first part some nice atmosphere, the rest is nice too. On the
grafix  side there isn't  much, some known stuff besides some  texture thingies,
there could  be more. Impressive are both musix, the Falcon module  is nice, but
I prefer the  chip music with  its old fashioned noises. So, what to say? I like
them both, the intro's you know?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  7o % - the "same" intro for both machines... nice idea!
effex.........  75 % - On Falcon not state of the art, for ST quiet stunning
grafix........  5o % - Just textures and one already used logo...
musix.........  9o % - the chip music rocks over the Falcon module...
design........  6o % - some transitions, timings, matching colours, atmosphere
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  69 % - A nice fast hacked intro...
