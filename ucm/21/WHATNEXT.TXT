                             WHAT'S COMING NEXT?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good question, don't you think? And my answer is: You decide it!

So what? As  UNDERCOVER # 22 isn't planned as .tSCc. only  release, you are very
welcomed to join our forces again, to bring UNDERCOVER back to its old glory.
If you want you  can write  articles about  any topic  you want, we prefer stuff
about the scene ofcourse, but will publish all other articles as well as long as
they don't have racism or too aggressive contents.

We aren't the people who say  what you have to write, do what  you want, as long
as you're doing something :)

What I have to say for the regular  writers staff? At the moment  just MC LASER,
RAY and me, MOONDOG, are here  and all I can say and promise  for the next issue
are the following things...

- ofcourse a huge party  section about the party of the  year, ERROR IN LINE 2k1
  will be included...
- because of some memory problems we couldn't include all stuff that was planned
  for this issue... coz  of the massive  included grafix and stuff we're running
  out of memory... furthermore I had  problems through  my broken monitor and so
  I can't and wont check more stuff for that issue. Be sure, because of that it
  wont took too long untill a next stuff issue will see the light :)
- if all things  running fine  it will be time for a big  14 MB demo round up as
  well, since we weren't able to check them up so far...
  ... other features are planned as well...

Oki... but now you should check up the  current issue at first, the most stuffed
issue of UNDERCOVER since 2 years...

.tSCc. - no promises - no demands!                                       moondog
