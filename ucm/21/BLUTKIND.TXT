--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by BETON KOPF MEDIA 2ooo

After the  brutal "Eevil Young Flesh" album last year, :wumpscut: aka Ratzinger,
Rudy, strikes back with this stuffed  double CD set, besides several re-released
albums he did  in the  early nineties. Before  I'll write more  lines here, just
look at the tracklist... it's marvellous...

Woah! 33 music tracks and one multimedia track, featuring  the lyrics of all :W:
tracks so far, a load pictures
Hmmm... 33 tracks?! Is it a best off? Surely not, even if there  are some of the
most impressing :W: tracks  included, like  the kewl "Soylent Green". So what is
Rudy doing then? Emptied he just his trashcan? Is he running  out of ideas? Does
he want to suck out the money of his fans? All wrong...

At first, Rudy  decided to put a bunch  of tracks from his first  releases, from
the  tapes "Small Chambermusicians" and "Defcon" onto this  CD set. "Defcon" was
released with  just 5o copies and  the otherone  with just 7o. No  question that
both releases are hard or better not to get anymore, at least as original stuff,
maybe just  as tape copies of shitty sound quality. Now those tracks are digital
remastered and open for a bigger community.

At second... nope, he doesn't  grabbed something out  of the trashcan. All those
unreleased tracks showing the ideas of Rudy and his power in  creating music and
over all in some way his roots and ways. Ok, some  of the tracks  are a bit hard
digestible. Furthermore  he came up with  two cool new  tracks too, changing the
way he directed with "Eevil Young Flash" back to harder noises again.

At  third... this double  CD costed only 35 DM, not  much more  than a normal CD
album and when you think what you will get for that price it is easy to see that
he don't wants to exploit his fans.

Ok, time to take a  closer look  to the tracks. I don't want  to write something
about every track, it would be a bit too much and tastes  are different. So I'll
start with tracks that are worth to be checked out.

"Hang Him Higher" - after  the very  hard "Eevil Young Flesh" album  this  track
 is going back to Rudi's roots. It isn't that hard industrial sound anymore, but
 more electronic under  use of german sound samples, very melodic  and sometimes
 even a bit depressive... this tune  seems to stand  in a line  with the smasher
 "Soylent Green"...
 
"Time Ticks Away" - that unreleased song is hard to describe, but lives from its
 kewl oldschool-electronic/wave-drum play. The rest of the song is built of hard
 distorted voices and sounds... only for fans of minimalistic electronics...

"Flangegod" - Yeah! That song truely rocks! Even the first beats offering a good
 drive, fast and stretched drums, the right thing to stomp around on the floor.

"Neolith" - A slow track  that could set you in  trance with its  ambient noises
 and soundscapes.
 
"Soylent Green" - A classic! Maybe one of the best known  tracks :WUMPSCUT" ever
 released. Unfortunately it is just the instrumental  version... "unfortunately"
 because the song lives not only from the cool speech samples from the movie but
 also from Rudi's singing, that is missing here.
 
"Default" - Another oldschool ebm/industrial stomper, goes straight  forward but
 is a bit short with just 2,5 minutes.
 
"Praise Your Fears" - The second new song, isn't of that quality as the otherone
 but has enough drive to set the dancefloor on fire. The major drawbacks are the
 too often use of the same samples.
 
"The Dark Chamber" - reminds me sometimes a bit to Skinny Puppy, therefore it is
 mentioned here.
 
Here some examples for strange tracks...

"The Hellion" - This crude  song mixes  hardrock with  electronix, an apocylptic
 thingie... and because I don't like hardrock  and heavy  metal the  whole thing
 isn't my taste at all...
 
"Run Like Hell Part2" - Another cruel song, just  featuring  soundscapes, disted
 noises and heavy stretched speech samples. Just for freaks.
 
"Frozen Images" - A true ambient song! Could be played in the  chill out zone of
 a raver disco as well!
 
"K-U-T-T" - This track is  pure electronic  hell! Just distorted  voice samples,
 the crulest noises  and most stretched and looped strings... horrible  and only
 for masochists...
 
"Lamandier" - Another example of Rudi's strange  experiments! It seems as he has
 heard  too much  QNTAL, a great medieval/electronic  musix  project  around the
 german darkwave legend "Deine Lakaien".
 
Ok, that is  just a small view onto the things... but as you can  see this CD is
surely more for people of oldschool electronix or better industrial. It features
a lot of  strange oldfashioned  tracks as well as some nice stompers. I wouldn't
say to  someone, who's interested in :WUMPSCUT:s music because  he got  his last
album, to  buy this workshow, nope. This album is  more thought for  real -Rudi-
fans and for the one who're missing some of his early releases.

And what  else? The bonus stuff isn't  that brainblasting. The multimedia  track
is sometimes a bit childish, sorry. Cool is a very big picture  gallery, showing
old and new artwork, pictures of fans and shows.
Usual are mailorder and the complete lyrics (german and english!)...

Time to find an end, eh? "BLUTKIND" is a pure workshow album, no true "bestoff".
It features tracks of 1o years :WUMPSCUT:, such as unreleased, rare and new ones
of different  quality and  for different tastes. A point I  enjoyed is  the nice
design of the CD box, featuring some black humor stuff like  little bloodchilds,
playing on a graveyard with skulls and digging out some tombstones, grin...
The price for this double CD is quiet ok, but  after all it's  more a CD for the
true :WUMPSCUT: fans, not for  newbies on  that sector. I would say it  would be
better to check it out in the store before buying it blind.
