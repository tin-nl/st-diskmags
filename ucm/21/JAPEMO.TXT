As I found that file on the DHS page I wondered a lot... ñ"JAPEMO"ð? Wasn't it the
demo that was announced many years ago by a french coder called òHYLSTð? Wasn't it
òHYLSTð itself who released a  preview of the  demo on some party back in 1999 (or
was it in 2ooo, dunno). I really don't know what's that now.

Anyway, the ñ"JAPEMO"ð that was  called to be the biggest  Manga demo on ST at all
(it was announced to come on 5 (!) disx), seems to be a very mysterious thingie.
To me it seemed as òHYLSTð  stopped the project  after he released  his preview on
that party because of the destructive critics on it... As I remember his preview
wasn't a hit, lacked a lot of design and originality.

And now the chaps of óSUPREMACYð, or better  the GFA  maniacs of óTYPHOONð are going
to release again a ñ"JAPEMO"ð. But after depacking the file and checking the read-
me-file  I found out that it was  just óSUPREMACYð's part of  the ñ"JAPEMO"ð, and is
called ñ"THE DRAGONBALL PART"ð. So why  are they releasing  it now? Is the JAPEMO-
project finally died completely? Argh... enough questions... start the review!

The first screen reminded me a lot to .tnb.'s demo ñ"TINY TOONS"ð, it started with
a Gameboy screen, showing  the title of the game "Dragonball". After a high beep
a chip music starts to play, done by òSCAVENGERð of óSYNERGYð. The Gameboy fades out
and a greyscaled pixeled piccy, showing a few guys in  a room, sitting  in front
of their computers, appears, overlayed by a óTYPHOONð logo.

This one  fades out as well and a textdisplayer starts to introduce you into the
demo. It features  a quiet ok  font but nothing more, but writes  over the whole
screen. Btw... this screen show's that this is just  a part of the ñ"JAPEMO"ð demo
that was planned by òHYLSTð of óTHE MANGA MANIACSð some years ago.
After that the  screen fades to white, showing a, to be honest, ugly logo saying
ñ"JAPEMO"ð in red and yellow colours, no antialiasing or something.

It goes on  with a little  animated picture of the head of the Dragon Ball hero,
who's blinking  with an eye. On the left side there is  a red logo  displayed...
Also those parts aren't antialiased... meuh!

At next the "main part" is coming up, showing at first a landscape with the hero
of the Manga series  who's collecting his powers to shot a power stream into the
right direction. This is a very simple animation with not much ani-moves...

At next a  scanned picture  of Bill Gates' head appears on  the screen, with his
name and a sarcastic latinum description of his  zoological species. Short after
this, the  powerstream  of our hero appears  on the screen, hit' the  head and a
very bad animated explosion comes up...

This stuff fades out and a simple try to do a  pixeled logo by òSENSERð appears on
the left side of the screen, saying óTYPHOONð, while some  yellow line circles are
flying around on the right side of  the screen. At the same moment  the music is
changing to a sid music by òDMA SCð.
The óTYPHOONð logo scrolls out and the final part comes up, showing another DRAGON
BALL  logo on  the lower part  of the screen, again  very  simple and  not a bit
antialiased  or something. On the upper part  the same  textdisplayer  as in the
intro comes up again, giving credits, greetings and some info again.

Before the demo reaches his end, they are giving us a preview of their next demo
and after  short time  of a black  screen two  fucking  scenes, showing japanese
school girls in Manga style, appearing on the screen. This part comes along with
some  technoing tracker  music and the  animations are  timed to the beat of the
music, boah! Tit-jumping!

After short time  the demo wents back to GEM, so there wasn't much  time to wank
or something :)

Final words... As this demo was  planned to be a  part of another  demo it has a
hard stand  as stand-alone-demo. Furthermore  I'm not a  big fan  of that Manga-
stuff and I don't like the style of bringing that comic to the ST, without a try
to redraw parts of the pictures or to use some antialiasing technices. Surely it
is a question of taste, but the frenchies seem to like it. At next the anti-Bill
jokes are just boring with the  time. I didn't laughed, esp. because the realise
of this idea wasn't  the best. Without any doubt the best thing on that demo are
the musix, again. Just a demo for collectors in my eyes.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  15 % - Not much to say, maybe the gameboy idea...
effex.........  1o % - Only fading routines and a few line circles
grafix........  6o % - surely a lot work with the ani's, but not very original
musix.........  75 % - two nice sid musix, the best on this demo...
design........  2o % - a few transitions and fading routines, but not much
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  36 % - again not even mediocre...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wonder  how long the óSUPREMACYð gang  will torment us  again with such releases
and I still hope to see something real in the future...
