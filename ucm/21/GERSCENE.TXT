                       GERMAN SCENE REPORT v.WINTER/Y2K+1
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah! It's long time ago that I tried to check up what's going on in Germany and
since  I'm back on  track with "my" magazine  I'm going to  continue some  of my
traditions  in òUNDERCOVERð. Today it's time for a closer look in our surroundings
again because something changed again...
So here  comes a round-up of what is left of the  german scene, who left us, who
is still here  and who has  joined our forces... Ofcourse all those bands who're
sleeping since many  years are kicked out of the list and will just be mentioned
with one or two lines if there are some activities left...
Ok, even if  its called "v.AUTUMN" it's more or less an  overview about  all the
changes of this nearly ended year.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñCHECKPOINTð

At first it seemed that they were fallen into deepest inactivities, later on the
band came back  to life again, with òDEFJAMð who opened a special  ñCHECKPOINTð page
again as well as a new demo project. The demo was planned to  be released on the
óSTNICCCð party but was hold back  because of a bunch  of bugs. So it  will surely
come in the next weeks or possibly (at last) on the óERROR IN LINEð party.
There were some rumours about a music demo with 5o5 zix as well.

Members .......... 5o5, Defjam, Joe Cool, mOdmate
Status ........... active
Latest Release ... SURETRIP demo on ST
Projects ......... another demo for ST, working title ò"MONOSTYLE"
homepage ......... http://www.8ung.at/checkpoint/
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñCREAM

At first I wanted  to call them the rulers of  the nowadays  german Atari scene,
but due the fact that they didn't released anything for months now, I decided to
call them  just as sleeping atm. Even if  the team got  3 coders nothing new was
announced. Rumours  came up  about ò"HEFTIG"ð but  nothing more. Since  they don't
even attended  to any party lately it is very  difficult to say  something about
their ways. The  last guy who  was showing up, was  óTAOð with  his works  for the
ñYM ROCKASð demo...

Members .......... A.-t-, Abyss, Candyman, Tao
Status ........... sleeping
Latest Release ... "JAM" player for Atari machines
Projects ......... "HEFTIG" demo for ST
Homepage ......... http://www.creamhq.de/
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñESCAPE

There happened  not much on the  ñESCAPEð front. They're organizing  together with
the ñCHECKPOINTð chaps the óERROR IN LINE 2k1ð but there isn't  more know. òSPIONð did
some gag program that brings the Windows Alert boxes to Atari.
Later on òSAGEð has left the band because of inactivity and no time for Atari and
òCHARONð, former member of the ñSTUNE DEVELOPMENT TEAMð, joined as coder.

Members .......... Charon, No, Shifter, Spion
Status ........... active
Latest Release ... some VLM modules, a joke program, the "EIL REMINDTRO"
Projects ......... unknown, maybe some demostuff, and VLM modules for sure
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñFOUNDATION TWO

The reason  to mention  them here is simple, they  organized the  óUNCONVENTIONAL
óPARTYð in September, the only german Atari scene party this year so far. It was a
very small  party but  a nice and strange one  anyway. Unfortunately  that's all
because they're mainly active on the 8bit sector nowadays. The public release of
all ñSOLUTION SOFTWAREð games is still not in sight even if it was  announced many
times so far... Another óUNCONVENTIONAL PARTYð is planned for next year.

Members .......... Beetle, Mad Butscher
Status ........... sleeping on 16/32 bit
Latest Release ... oh... I can't remember
Projects ......... unknown
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñPARANOIA

It was quiet for a long time around them and  the óUNCONVENTIONAL PARTYð showed us
why... óPARANOIDð was  checking out the  deep secrets  of Assembler programming in
the last  months, and  because  the most parts of the band worked on their first
Falcon demo too we have to call them active, no question...
Finally another small intro appeared in December.

Members .......... Der Komtur, Luebke, Marcstar, Mr Future, Paranoid, TNT
Status ........... active
Latest Release ... HERESY demo for Falcon, Xmas 2ooo Intro for ST
Projects ......... another Falcon demo for EIL PARTY
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñRD DEVELOPMENTS

Suddenly this new team (?) appeared on the screen, announcing some big projects,
such as ports  of ò"WOLFENSTEIN 3D"ð and ò"DOOM"ð for the ST. I don't  know anything
about those people so far but I hope I can bring some light in  this question in
short time... Anyway, they seem  to be the most interesting newcomers (?) in the
german scene at all.

Members .......... Reimund, Dirk
Status ........... dead
Latest Release ... first test engine for "WOLFENSTEIN 3D" on ST
Projects ......... check out .tSCc.
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñRUNNING DESIGN TEAM

It was  very quiet  around them  too the last months... At  first there  was the
release of a demoversion  of the game for óMILANð announced for April, but nothing
happened. Now they announced the óMILANð version of ò"RUNNING"ð for December and
since the óMILANð was  cancelled they cancelled the project as well. Later on they
dissolved the ñRDTð label and started under MAGIC FOUR, but now PC only again.

Members .......... Volker, Mike (Stax), Michael, Holger and several others
Status ........... dead
Latest Release ... "RUNNING PLATIN VERSION" for Falcon
Projects ......... no Atari related stuff anymore
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAX

Hmmm... if there  will nothing happen on  this sector I have to delete them from
the big  list again... It seems  as the three  last survivors  of this band, all
coders btw, are working alone for themselves instead of joining their forces...
Furthermore  their latest  release came  from their  british member  and as óMIKE
told me he's too busy with other things than going on for his old label...

Members .......... Bod, Matt, Mike
Status ........... sleeping
Latest Release ... "DAWN OF THE DEAD" demo for ST
Projects ......... maybe some compiles by MATT again?
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñSTUNE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

The people behind  this label broke through the limit of  doing just a game this
year, 'coz óTHOTHYð released  a 128byte intro at the  óUNCON PARTYð for Falcon. Also
some  update  of ò"STUNE"ð was  released again  but atm. this project  seems to be
laying on ice. Atm. it seems as óTHOTHYð is the only active man, but I'm not sure
if his productions are running under the òSDTð label too... óCHARONð left lately the
team to join the forces of òESCAPEð.

Members .......... Thothy, ?!
Status ........... active
Latest Release ... "BURNING BEE" intro for Falcon
Projects ......... unknown, surely further versions of "STUNE"...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ñTHE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORPORATION

My band has doubled  its members within a year since Gizmo, Ray, Unseen Fate and
Creature XL joined our  forces. Furthermore  the band was slowly coming  back to
life with a bunch of releases  of any kind. For more information check the files
in óSIRIUS.DEð.

Members .......... Creature XL, Dynacore, Gizmo, Llama, MC Laser, Moondog, Ray,
.................. Scy, Unseen Fate
Status ........... active
Latest Releases .. CENTAURI Intro, fixed SIRIUS PLAYER and UNDERCOVER # 21
.................. FADING TWILIGHT CD ROM, FADING TWILIGHT intros for Atari & PC
Projects ......... some more UCM's and ...?
Homepage ......... http://www.sirlab.de/
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it for the people who're still contributing to the  Atari scene with some
releases  from time  to time. Not  much  left and  sometimes you can  feel a bit
lonely here, no newcomers in sight at all.

óTHE REST...

ñABSENCEð ....... óTHE INNOVATORð  has  organized  a new  ñKINDERGEBURTSTAGð  party in
                December, mainly for ex-Atarians, but as rumours  said, it was a
                flop  due the fact of the  bad information stream  and that  the
                ñSTNICCCð party happened just one weekend before.

ñANIMAL MINEð ... óMCð is appearing here  and there, releasing  some old  stuff from
                time to time or working mainly as óSLIPPYð of òVECTRONIXð...

ñLIGHTð ......... Since  óMEGA TRIð isn't going to  Atari parties anymore, óMR XYð has
                taken  over his  job to appear  everywhere. Maybe  some homepage
                featuring the  óGOREZONEð files will see  the light someday, but I
                just believe only in the things I can see.

ñRISKð .......... Yep, another  sleeping band popped  up again, óDANNY Oð. created a
                homepage featuring  all òRISKð releases so far as well as some new
                musicworks by him.

ñTCEð ........... Since this band lost all their coders nothing happened for years
                now, just a few people, mainly of the former band òBLUE SOFTWAREð,
                are left just as óSECRET TOPð and óTHE BYTEð. They upped  a homepage
                and some more CD ROM is planned. Nothing more...

ñ.tnb.ð ......... óFLASHð just reworked  their homepage but that's all since the EIL
                party, óDRIZZTð's  destination  is unknown  as well  as óFXLð's. óLOT
                went to the United States and moved his home later to Munich and
                lost all interest in doing "scene music"...

                                                               moondog / .tSCc.
