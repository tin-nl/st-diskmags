                        WHAT ABOUT ...INSTABIL...?!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good question I think... Let me  explain you something about  this mysterious
project and its end.

After I stopped  UNDERCOVER last  year after  the  ERROR IN LINE party  I never
thought  about a  comeback. My  time was filled  with other  stuff and for many
weeks and months I lost all interest in scene and so on.

But it doesn't went long  untill I checked out that several people didn't liked
the new UCM style. Furthermore the mag started to loose its good reputation, it
was shrinking of  the size, several people  wanted to stop their support for it
and short before Xmas last year, as my private  life was mainly cleared up, the
first thoughts about a comeback were born.

At the  one hand I  was a bit angry  because it  seemed as STsurvivor was short
before to  destroy "my" magazine. At the  other hand there was  the fact that I
had handed it over to him completely and I had no rights on it anymore.
Furthermore other  mags seemed  to be vanished  completely and so  there was no
competition anymore, a point  that could be responsible for going the wrong way
too.

The first thoughts  were about  taking over the magazine, with or  without Seb,
but this would  have started another little war in this  small scene too and so
after short time I decided to create a "new" magazine, called ...inSTabil...
This magazine was thought for the people who disliked the current state of UCM,
it was thought as moondog's UCM, just with another title.

And so I started to write article for my own publication, weeks and months went
by and the internal release date was postponed again and again. I hadn't enough
time to make big steps in the development.

Then in summer  something strange  happened... STsurvivor announced the dead of
UNDERCOVER, and  the possible dead of MAGGIE too, just to join forces for a new
publication... ALIVE!
Hum, both rivals together under a new label?! This can't be! And because my own
magazine, ...inSTabil... was just a pure UCM just with another name, we decided
to take over the old name  again, because it wasn't in use anymore. And because
there is a need for  competition and UCM was known as  hard competitor, we will
go on in this way...

So ...inSTabil... died  before  its birth. And  ALIVE! will  get a new  and old
rival and so it should be forced to be make the best of its idea.

That's all about it...

                                                               moondog / .tSCc.
