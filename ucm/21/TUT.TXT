                            WILDFIRE SAYS "TUT"
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

system... ST, STe, Fo3o, 1 MB RAM, RGB

size..... 14o KB on harddisk

code..... ZOUNDS, BAGGIO
grafix... HAVOC of FUN
musix.... BAGGIO, DMA SC of SECTOR ONE

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ó"TUT"ð is now the  last ñSILLYVENTUREð demo that was released, and as all the other
releases of that party it also is the party version. It is really strange to see
just another party version about 4 months after the party itself...

But I'm happy that the only ST demo of this party was released at all and to get
it for a test. Just see, the fat ST year of 1999 seems to be over, tons of demos
were released last year and in 2ooo the whole revival seems to be on his end, or
at least all those people who showed up mega activities last  year seem to sleep
this year.

Oki, it's time to check up what the òWILDFIREð guys did...

ó"TUT"ð seems  to stay in  some tradition to old  òWILDFIREð  productions, just like
ó"MAGIQUE"ð from  1995/96 or ó"IMMORTALIZE"ð from  1998, because  it's  a  multipart
dentro again, not even 15o KB in size, but happily it breaks the  STE limit this
time and runs on any machine from ST up to Falcon, if you have 1MB RAM ofcoz.

Ok, the demo starts with some  rocking chipmusix made by ñBAGGIOð and a red spline
that winds around on the screen and later  on it forms  the letters  of òWILDFIRE
after another. Short after this a logo with the title of the demo appears, drawn
by ñHAVOCð and as this guy likes women it features one with an axe... good stuff.

The next part  features waterdrops and the picture of a naked girl  on the right
side. The effect is good but the chosen  colours are more  as ugly... red as red
can be. Hmmm... something seems to be missed in this demo... design, you know?

The coming picture is wellknown, also done  by ñHAVOCð and  drawn for the ñERROR IN
ñLINEð one year back as I remember right. It's the "Plastic Surgery" one, followed
by a plasma screen... not so stunning, a quiet old effect, but ok.

After that the two òWILDFIREð boys, ñBAGGERð and ñZOUNDSð are showing up in cool poses
with sunglasses (right or just faked?) on their nooses. Right  beside those pics
some shaded and delayed vectors, as vector areas and filled vectors are shown, a
nice effect again, but if I remember right I saw it  much better  years ago (the
chaps of òANIMAL MINEð did  some stuff like that in the early nineties). Again the
chosen colours aren't state of the art... just dark blue tones...

Ok, now comes their tribute to the wellknown tunnel mania, but òWILDFIREð's effort
doesn't break  any records or limits. Furthermore  the colours are  more stylish
but too bonbon'ish now... dunno, the single parts don't matched to each other :(

Hm, and because  the demo was shown in Poland, nearby the  russian frontier, the
next picture  by ñHAVOCð says Nastrovye  to all the  wodka drinkers  around at the
party place. Surely that was a strategic move to get more points, eh? And surely
ñHAVOCð thought the same as he painted it for the competition? ;)

The upcoming effect is quiet wired, it's some kind of coloured wirl thing, dunno
how to call it. It features again more stylish colours but after  all it doesn't
brings me to yell out. It looks strange, not bad, but nothing more... It was the
last effect before the endpart...

Greetings  and credits  time... at the end of the  demo a new  music, remixed by
ñDMA SCð starts to play, meanwhile a dots tunnel is moving around on the screen.
The usual messages are displayed by a nice font by ñHAVOCð again, as well as there
comes some  little TUT logo up again. And so the show is over after not too long
time... hmm, was it really all? But I remember their other  demo releases on STE
and so I know that it was all... òWILDFIREð demos are  usually not  very long, but
this one features the most effex so far.

It's time for the final words now...

òWILDFIREð surprised us with the first ST demo in 2ooo that is  worth to be called
a demo and to be mentioned at all. It's a bit short but  not bad. Ok, the effecs
don't break any limits, they're  nice to watch but don't let me say "aaah", they
are just quiet ok. Therefore  the demo  features  several good  pictures made by
ñHAVOCð, even if the "half naked blond girl" theme is some kind of boring with the
time. Therefore the demo lacks design. The effex seem to be  smashed together in
a hurry, some  selected palettes are really ugly, meanwhile others  are nice. It
is no designstuff like flowing transitions or so implemented... bad...
Therefore the musix are nice, the first rocking and  kicking, the second matches
to an endscreen as well, let you breath again after that show.
What to say? A nice little demo but far away from reaching any  olymp at the ST-
scene...

originality...  55 % - Not a blast of saying-wow-moments...
effex.........  65 % - Tunnel, waterdrops, vectors, nothing too special
grafix........  8o % - good pixelwork by Havoc, but sometimes seen before
musix.........  8o % - Two great chip musix, rocking and chilling
design........  3o % - No real transitions, sometimes ugly colours
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one ...  62 % - Nice demo again, but something is still missing...

Ok, so we wait for your first turn on Falcon!
