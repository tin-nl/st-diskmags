I decided  to review this older ñDELERIUMð  album because they're kicking butt atm
in the german charts  with remixes  of their  old (chart) hit "SILENCE" from the
year 1999 again.

Due the fact of my free  Inet access (or am I wrong? hehe...) and  the knowledge
about their inofficial  homepage I decided  to leech  their complete "SPHERES 2"
album  there. I stepped  many times onto their  page and leeched a  lot of other
stuff as well but "SPHERES 2" was the  first album I  leeched completely because
it rocks... Furthermore I decided to review it here and so people who are really
interested in their music can leech the files too. But take care, it takes about
57 Megabytes and so you need some time to bann it to your harddisk...

So what... maybe  you don't know anything about ñDELERIUMð? That  band consists of
Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb... yes, ñDELERIUMð is a side  project (if we can call it
so) of  ñFRONTLINE ASSEMBLYð. And  meanwhile  Leeb and Fulber are  on the electro/
industrial trip with FLA, they're on the trance trip with ñDELERIUMð.

The current DELERIUM releases are going more and more into synth/psychedelic/pop
or something, by  massive use  of female vocals and  their smash  hits "DUENDE",
"EUPHORIA" and also "SILENCE" should be wellknown.

Therefore their older releases, just as "SPHERES II" from the early nineties and
released on  their old label  HYPNOTIC records  (that also covers acts like JUNO
REACTOR, 8o8 STATE, FUTURE SOUND OF LONDON and DEAD VOICES ON AIR) are more very
ambient/trance-a-like. Ok, before taking a closer look I will give you the track
list...

{*i sphere.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

o1 - Morphology                 9:28
o2 - Transhumanist             1o:12
o3 - Shockwave                  8:34
o4 - Dimensional Space          5:28
o5 - Hypoxia                    8:5o
o6 - Otherworld                 4:49
o7 - In Four Dimensions        12:33

Yes, just 7 tracks but  with a playtime of  about one hour you  can imagine what
stuff awaits you, esp. while reading the track titles. If you wouldn't know what
people staying behind ñDELERIUMð, you wouldn't believe that  they're the same that
did such breaking electro/industrial stuff like "Millenium" or "Electrocution".

Nope, with  ñDELERIUMð they're opening the door to  a very ambient  and colourfull
world. The tracks are filled  with trance  waves, slow rhythms, beeps and boinks
from a  3o3 or  something and many  noises. In some way you could say  it is the
right soundtrack for a diving tour.

You can just lean back, close your eyes and listen to the tracks, or better take
some tool that visualises the noises in a very ambient way to your screen...
real cool stuff!

I can't describe the single tracks, because they're more or less building a full
unit but if  you're a fan  of dark ambient and dark trance you should  visit the
ñDELERIUMð page or your next record dealer to check the stuff out!
