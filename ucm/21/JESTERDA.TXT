Uuuuuuuuuuuuuh... how long we had to wait for this demo?! Rumours about an Atari
conversion of this famous Amiga 5oo music demo never ended and guided us through
the last years and finally no one expected a release of this demo at all...

...untill a  short message on  the DHS board was given, that "JESTERDAY" finally
reached our beloved Atari machines, or at least the Falcons...

But how  we have to  understand the word "conversion"?! Is it a  remake with all
the original grafix, design, effex and musix? Or have we all another idea of the
word or of doing a "conversion"?!

And because I know  this demo very well from the  Amiga 5oo, esp. my brother had
one many years  ago and a friend  of mine was  a fanatic  demo collector on this
machine too, I was very anxious to see how  MSD matched it to "convert" the demo
to the Atari, but to say it right now, I had something like a bad  feeling in my
stomach, because  I  know  MSD's ST and  Falcon  demo  releases  too, just  like
"POVERTY" and  those don't  blasted  any brain  away, even  in the time of their
release back in the early nineties.

And so I checked  up the folder on my HD, a short TXT file was included to, with
some bug stuff and the original scroll text from the Amiga demo.

Ok, so I started the  big file (1.2 MB) and my screen  turned black... and after
a while I heard some wellknown noises and then the first picture, a rendered one
of minimal quality, saying "POV presents" appeared on the screen.
Ugh... that wasn't  a good sign  to me, it remembers hard to other POV  releases
and now I had an idea what MSD understands under converting a demo...

At next another rendered logo with some lenseflare stuff appeared on the screen,
saying "JESTERday"... wow... I'm feeling sad about the fact that  this old Amiga
demo, and it was a good one, was ported so loveless to the Falcon.

Finally the screen where you can chose the musics appears on the screen. You can
chose them using the F-keys 1 to 6, with the Help key you can get a small screen
with the credits.
The tracks are partly wellknown because they aren't  new anymore and the rippers
already did great work in former times, hehe.

I will not  loose much words about the style of  the modules, it's old fashioned
Amiga demo sound, this  should match nearly  perfect to them. Eh... You all know
the style of JESTER, he wrote funky modules with mostly  happy melodies and very
wellknown samples. I can't take it anymore, sorry, but for me Jester's musix are
played to death over the years. Sure, he was (is) a great musician, one or maybe
the best on Amiga  at all, but I don't like this old fashioned sound anymore and
the fact that several tunes and samples from him were used again and again, esp.
in the Atari scene, lowers the  aha effect about his tunes  a lot. Therefore the
not so high rating for the musics btw...

So, what I  have to add  here? The tunes are giving some cruel  sounds at first,
maybe a  problem of the packer or module format? This is pointed out in the TXT-
file too. There is no chance to quit the demo except reset... meuh!

The last words...

Maybe this  demo is something for collectors, something for lovers of old school
Amiga soundtracks, but nothing more. I runned it over and over again for writing
this  article, but wont  do it anymore. I was  very disturbed about  the putting
together because I have another idea of a "conversion" as MSD as it seems.
I just have to say, judge by yourself, but don't await too much!

originality...  2o % - What is original?! Just a bad conversion of a good demo!
effex.........  oo % - Nothing I would call an effect, not even a scroller!
grafix........  4o % - Simple rendering stuff, uhhh... 
musix.........  7o % - Just "old early nineties" tracker msx, made by a legend!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
