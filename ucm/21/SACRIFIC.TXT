UUUhhhh... the  satanists are back! After 3 years of silence, they  came back to
release  another anti christian demo. After  their last two  releases, that were
technical  ok, but never  up to  date, because of effect-recycling  and mediocre
grafix and musix  stuff. Because of their long break I  thought and  hopped that
those  people are vanished  from the scene, because I  still don't like the idea
to spread political or religious thoughts in the demo scene.

Anyway, they did it again. This demo was presented at the SILLYVENTURE party and
made (ofcourse) the last place in the  competition. At the other  hand it is the
only demo that runs on a standard Falcon.

The demo  starts with a fairly atmospheric intro, showing some  landscape with a
sundown, scrolling  horizontal over the screen. A Pandemonium logo in  black and
old styled letters is displayed  before the red sky and after the whole thing is
scrolling in the other direction it fades out. While this fading the whole thing
is going to slow  down horrible... uuh... Aerr... I forgot to mention the noises
in the background.

After  that the  usual presents stuff  in small white writings is  displayed and
followed by a picture of a flaming sword, together with the credits.
The whole  picture is overfaded by  another pic, showing a  satanistic mess in a
church. Nice picture, but I still think it isn't originally drawn by the grafist
mentioned in the credits... In this  part of the demo  also the  music starts to
play. It  sounds like  oldschool modules, not  my taste. Maybe it is  thought to
sound like blackmetal or something, at least the  fast drum play  the bad try to
include guitar samples gave me that impression.

As the whole thing has changed you will see a blue gouraud shaded vector, making
his way over the screen, coming back with a  lightsource  to give a shadow. Then
the pic in the background is  splitting up and giving free a big  ball. This one
will get several textures  then, stretched in ball  form, some  gouraud stuff as
well and after different textures appeared on it, it is going back into the pic,
that is splitted up again, and finally the end scroller comes up.

This endscroller  is a starwars scroll, gives some info again, and, very strange
for a satanistic demo, the makers want that we will forgive them, because of the
fast hacking together of the whole  demo... I thought the  word "forgive" is not
thought to be present in the brains of satanistic people?!

Nothing more to add here, that the  whole demo ends with some 7o Hz crap that is
originally known from french demos. So kick that shit! Let's write some...

FINAL WORDS...

The people from the  polish wastelands are  back to present some  other outdated
Falcon production and to spread some more anti christian thoughts. This time the
stuff is reduced to just a picture of the mentioned satanistic church, including
the usual stuff like turned crosses and pentagrams (when will those simpleminded
people check out that turning a cross or pentagram means really nothing...). The
effex are outdated and as always seen before. It's just a ridiculous release...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  35 % - the satanistic idea is squeezed out, nothing new at all.
effex.........  5o % - mainly textured ball stuff, not much...
grafix........  55 % - still don't believe in their originality...
musix.........  55 % - some dumb drum pseudo-metal-curd...
design........  4o % - fairly atmospheric intro, some fading and blinking...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  47 % - Heya, still too much points for that crap...
