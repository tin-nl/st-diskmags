                                   -============-

Yoho, allerseits. Ja also  diesen folgenen  Text Åber den  68060 Processor habe
ich  irgendwann  mal  gekriegt  und  seitdem  vergammelt er  auf meiner Pladde.
Ich denke  mal das er fÅr manche doch recht interessant ist. Dieser  Text wurde
nicht von  mir geschrieben.  Wer ihn geschrieben  hat steht am Ende. Leider ist
er in Englisch. Tja, wer Lust hat kann ihn ja mal Åbersetzen. Aber ich NICHT!!!
So genug gelabert... Viel Spaz noch....

Product Brief

Forth-Generation 32-Bit Microprocessor

The  MC 68060 is a  superscalar,  high-performance,  32-bit microprocessor
providing a  low-power mode of operation.  The MC68060 is fully compatible
with all previous members of the M68000 family.  The MC68060 features dual
on-chip caches,  fully independent  demand-paged  memory  management units
(MMUs) for  both instructions and data,  dual integer execution pipelines,
on-chip floating-point unit (FPU),  and branch target cache. A high degree
of instruction execution parallelism is achieved through the use of a full
internal Havard architecture,  multiple internal buses, independent execu-
tion units,  and dual instruction  issue within  the instruction execution
controller.  Power management is also a  key part of the MC68060 architec-
ture.  The MC68060 offers a low-power mode  of operation that  is accessed
through the LPSTOP instruction,  allowing for  full power-down capability.
The MC68060  design is fully static so  that when circuits are not in use,
they do not draw power.  Each unit  can be disabled  so that the  power is
used only when the unit  is enabled and executing an instruction. Figure 1
illustrates a block diagram of the MC68060.

                            INTEGER UNIT

The MC68060's integer unit carries out logical  and arithmetic operations.
The integer unit  contains an instruction  fetch controller,  an execution
controller,  and  a branch  target cache.  The superscalar  design  of the
MC68060  provides  dual execution  pipelines in  the intruction  execution
controller, providing simultaneous execution.

The superscalar operation of the integer unit can be disabled in software,
turning off the second executionpipeline for debugging. Disabling the
superscalar operation also lowers power consumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4
INSTRUCTION FETCH CONTROLLER

The intruction fetch controller contains an instruction fetch pipeline and
the logic that  interfaces to  the branch  target cache.  The  instruction
fetch pipeline consists  of four stages, providing the ability to prefetch
instructions in advance of their actual use  in the instruction cache con-
troller. The continous fetching of  instructions kepps the instruction ex-
excution controller busy for the greatest possible performance.  Every in-
struction  passes through each of the four  stages before entering the in-
struction execution controller.  The four stages in the  instruction fetch
pipeline are:

1.  Instruction Address Calculation -- The virtual address of the instruc-
    tion is determined.

2.  Instruction Fetch -- The instruction is fetched from memory.

3.  Early Decode -- The instruction  is pre-decoded  for pipeline  control
    information.

4.  Instruction Buffer -- The instruction and  its pipeline control infor-
    mation are buffered until the  integer execution pipeline is  ready to
    process the instruction.


BRANCH TARGET CACHE

The branch target cache plays the major role  in achieving the performance
levels of the MC68060.  The concept of  the branch target cache is to pro-
vide a mechanism that allows the instruction  fetch pipeline to detect and
change the instruction stream  before the change of flow  affects the  in-
struction execution controller.

The branch target  cache is examined for a valid  branch entry  after each
instruction fetch address is  generated in the intruction  fetch pipeline.
If a hit does not occur  in the branch target cache, the instruction fetch
pipeline continues to fetch instructions sequentially.  If a hit occurs in
the branch target cache,  indicating a branch taken instruction,  the cur-
rent  instruction  stream is  discarded  and a new  instruction stream  is
fetched starting at the location indicated by the branch target cache.


INSTRUCTION EXECUTION CONTROLLER

The instruction execution controller contains dual integer execution pipe-
lines,  interface logic to the FPU,  and control logic for data written to
the data cache and MMU.  The superscalar design of the dual integer execu-
tion pipeline provide for simultaneous instruction execution, which allows
the processing more than one  instruction during each machine clock cycle.
The net effect of this  is a software  invisible pipeline capable  of sus-
tained execution rates of less than on machine clock cycle per instruction
for the MC68060 instruction set.

The instruction execution  controller's control logic  pulls an intruction
pair from the instruction buffer every machine clock cycle,  stopping only
if the instruction information is not available or if an integer execution
hold condition exists.  The six stages in the dual integer execution pipe-
lines are:

1.  Instruction decode -- The instruction is fully decoded.

2.  Effective address calculation -- If  the  instruction  calls for  data
    from memory, the location of the data is calculated.

3.  Effective address fetch -- Data is fetched from the memory location.

4.  Integer execution -- The data is manipulated during the execution.

5.  Data available -- The result is available.

6.  Write-Back -- The resulting data  is written back to on-chip caches or
    external memory.

The MC68060 if optimized for most  integer instructions  to execute in one
machine clock cycle.  If during the instruction decode stage, the instruc-
tion  is determined to  be a floating-point instruction, it will be passed
to the  FPU after  the  effective address  fetch stage.  If data  is to be
written to either the on-chip caches or external  memory after instruction

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 5
execution,  the write-back  stage holds the data  until memory is ready to
receive it. Temporarily holding data  in the write-back  stage adds to the
overall  performance of  the  MC68060 by not slowing  down pipeline opera-
tions.


                            FLOATING-POINT UNIT

Floating-point is  distinguished from  integer math, which deals only with
whole  numbers  and fixed  decimal  point locations.  The  IEEE-compatible
MC68060's FPU computes numeric  calculations with a variable decimal point
locationThe MC68060 features a built-in FPU that is MC68040 and MC68881/82
compatible. Consolidating this  important function on-chip speeds up over-
all processing and eliminates interfacing overhead  associated with exter-
nal accelerators.  The MC68060's FPU operates in parallel with the integer
unit.  The FPU performs numeric calculations while the integer unit conti-
nues integer processing.

The FPU has been optimized  for the most frequently  used instructions and
data types to  provide the highest possible performance.  The FPU can also
be disabled in software to reduce system power consumption.


FLOATING POINT EMULATION

The  MC68060 implements the most  frequently  M68000 family floating-point
instructions,  data-types, and  data formats  in hardware  for the highest
performance. T he remaining instructions are emulated in software with the
M68060FPSP  to provide  complete IEEE  compatibility. The MC68060FPSP pro-
vides the following features:

- Arithmetic and Transcendental Instructions

- IEEE-Compliant Exception Handlers

- Unimplemented Data Type and Data Format Handlers


                          MEMORY MANAGEMENT UNITS

The MC68060 contains independent instruction and data MMUs.  Each MMU con-
tains a cache memory called the address translation cache (ATC).  The full
addressing range  of the MC68060 is  4 Gbytes (4,294,967,296 bytes).  Even
though most  MC68060 systems  implement a much smaller physical memory, by
using virtual  memory techniques,  the system can  appear to have a full 4
Gbytes of physical memory  available to each user program.  Each MMU fully
supports demand-paged  virtual-memory  systems  with  either 4- or 8-Kbyte
page sizes.  Each MMU protects supervisor areas from accesses by user pro-
grams and provides write-protection  on a page-by-page basis.  For maximum
efficiency, each MMU operates in parallel with other processor activities.
The MMUs can be disabled for emulator and debugging support.

ADDRESS TRANSLATION

The 64-entry, four-way,  set-associative ATCs store recently used logical-
to-physical  address translation  information as  page descriptors for in-
struction and data accesses.  Each MMU  initiates address  translation  by
searching for a descriptor containing the  address translation information
in the ATC. If the descriptor does not reside in the ATC, the MMU performs
external bus cycles through  the bus controller to  search the translation
tables in  physical memory.  After being located,  the page  descriptor is
loaded  into the ATC,  and the address is correctly translated for the ac-
cess.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6
                       INSTRUCTION AND DATA CACHES

Studies have  shown that  typical programs  spend much of their  execution
time in a few main routines of tight loops.  Earlier members of the M68000
family took advantage of  this locality-of-reference phenomenon to varying
degrees.  The MC68060 takes further advantage of cache technology with its
two, independent,  on-chip  physical chaches,  one for instruction and one
for data.  The caches reduce the processor's external bus activity and in-
crease CPU throughput by lowering the effective memory access time.  For a
typical system designm  the large  caches of the MC68060 yield a hery high
hit rate, providing a substantial increase in system performance.

The  autonomous nature  of the  caches allows  intruction-stream  fetches,
data-stream fetches,  and external  accesses to occur  simultaneously with
instruction execution.  For example,  if the MC68060 requires  both an in-
struction access  and an external peripheral access and if the instruction
is resident in the in-chip cache,  the periphal access  proceeds umimpeded
rather than being queued behind the  instruction fetch.  If a data operand
is also  required and it is resident in the data cache, it can be accessed
without hindering  either the instruction  access or the external periphal
access.  The parallelism inherent  on the MC68060 also allows multiple in-
structions  that do not  require any  external accesses to execute concur-
rently while the processor is performing an external access for a previous
instruction.

Each MC68060 cache is 8 Kbytes,  accessed by physical addresses.  The data
can be configured as  write-through or deferred  copyback on a page-basis.
This choice  allows for optimizing the system  design for the high perfor-
mance if deferred copyback is used.

Cachability of data  in each memory page is  controlled by two bits in the
page descriptor.  Cachable pages  can be either write-through or copyback,
with no write-allocate for misses to write-through pages.

The MC68060  implements a  four-entry write buffer  that maximizes  system
performance by  decoupling the  integer pipeline from the  external system
bus.  When needed, the write buffer allows the pipeline to generate writes
every clock cycle,  even if the system bus runs at a slower speed than the
processor.

CACHE ORGANIZATION

The instruction and  data caches are each organized  as 4-way set associa-
tive, with 16-bite lines.  Each line of data has associated with it an ad-
dress tag and  state information  that shows the  line's validity.  In the
data cache,  the state  information indicates  wheter the line is invalid,
valid, or dirty.

CACHE COHERENCY

The MC68060 has the ability to watch or  snoop the external bus during ac-
cesses by other bus masters,  maintaining coherency  between the MC68060's
caches and external memory systems.  External bus cycles can be flagged on
the bus as snoopable or nonsnoopable.  When an external cycle is marked as
snopable,  the bus snooper checks the caches  and invalidates the matching
data.  Although the  integer execution  units and the  bus snooper circuit
have access to the on-chip caches, the snooper has priority over the exec-

The bus  is implemented as  a nonmultiplexed,  fully synchronous  protocol
that is clocked off the rising edge of the input clock. The bus controller
operates  concurrently with  all other functional  units of the MC68060 to
maximize system throughput. The timing of the bus is fully configurable to
match external memory requirements.

                            IEEE 1149.1 TEST

To aid the system diagnostics, the MC68060 includes dedicated user-access-
ible test logic  that is fully compliant with the IEEE 1149.1 standard for
boundary scan testablility,  ofter referred to as Joint Test  Action Group
(JTAG).


                      POWER CONSUMPTION MANAGEMENT


The  MC68060 is  very power  efficient due to  the static logic  and power
management designed into the basic architecture. Each stage of the integer
unit pipelines and the  FPU pipeline  draws power only when an instruction
is executing, and the cache arrays draw power only when an access is made.
The FPU,  secondary integer execution pipeline,  branch target cache,  and
instruction  and data  caches can  be disabled to reduce overall power us-
age.  The 3.3-V power  supply reduces  current consumption  by 40-60% over
that of microprocessors using a 5-V power supply.

The MC68060 has additional methods for  dynamically controlling power con-
sumption during operation. Running a special LPSTOP instruction shuts down
the active circuits in the processor,  halting intruction execution. Power
consumption in this standby mode is greatly reduced.  Processing and power
consumption can be resumed by  resetting the processor or by generating an
interrupt.  The frequency of operation  can  be lowered to reduce  current
consumtion while the device is in LPSTOP mode.


                                PHYSICAL

The MC68060  will be available  as 50 MHz and 66 MHz versions,  with 3.3-V
supply voltage, an in ceramic PGA and CQFP packaging configurations.

-- cut here -- cut here -- cut here -- cut here -- cut here -- cut here --

That was the COMPLETE information on the MC68060. Nothing's been changed
by me nor by any other person. Please, if you spread this file, don't kill
the notice that this file was written by me. It took me 3 hrs. of enormous
work, because my friend's scanner wasn't able to cope with the figures and
the different text sizes.

Comments, spelling mistakes a.s.o. to the list or to my personal account.

Much fun reading this sheet,

PPS: It may be that Figure 1 is too wide ... well I cannot help it !
