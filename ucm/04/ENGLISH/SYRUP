A group of wild intergalactic crumpets take over the  Enterprise and drown eve-
rybody in Aunt Jemima's Butter-Flavoured Imitation Maple Syrup!
 
GEORDI: "Captain, the  syrup has  broken through the  lower level decks  and is
         approaching the Bridge through turboshaft 2.
 
PICARD: "My God, will the containment fields hold?"
 
[Maple syrup pours in through the turbolift doors...]
 
GEORDI: "Guess not.  Brurble....burble....blachk"

PICARD: "I'm not impressed, Mr. LaForge.  There's  only one thing  that has the
         power to save us. Computer, flood the ship with Tea - Earl Grey - Hot.
         Hold the cream. If I'm  going to be drown  in edibles, I might as well
         enjoy myself."
 
RIKER:  "Perhaps we should initiate Auto-Destruct, Captain."
 
PICARD: "We're up to our  necks in maple  syrup.  ISN'T THAT DESTRUCTIVE ENOUGH
         FOR YOU?"
 
DATA:   "Captain, I believe I have a solution."
 
[Data beams a tribble onto the bridge]
 
[Three minutes later, the Bridge, and  the Enterprise in  general, is one huge,
seething, purring mass of fur.]
 
[Commotion at the aft Bridge area...]
 
WORF:   "AAAAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!...."
 
TRIBBLE "AAAAAIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE...."

PICARD: "Data, we're really going to have to talk about your 'solutions'"
 
TROI:   "I sense great containment from them sir. Great contentment and happi-
         ness. Except for the ones Worf is stomping on..."
 
PICARD: "Oh SHUT UP FOR ONCE, WILL YOU!"
 
WESLEY: "Captain..."
 
PICARD: "Oh, God, he's BACK".  [Breaks into uncontrollable sobs...]
 
WESLEY: "All I have to do is alter the laws of physics as they apply to Quantum
         molecular warp field alterations, and we should have no problem."
 
DATA:   "Intriguing. That would take several years, though."
 
WESLEY: "Why? Just see it in your head."
 
DATA:   "Stupid  little  arrogant #$##%&*! # TWERP....  That 'screaming  torch'
         idea Lore had is looking better and better with each episode."
 
BEVERLY "What was that, Mr. Data?"

DATA:   "Just commenting on what a wonderful idea Wesley had..."
 
WESLEY: "Oh noooo... the tribble has eaten the isolinear optical chips. My idea
         won't work now."
 
PICARD: "How did this happen?  What did I do to deserve this? I'd give anything
         to have my ship back."
 
[Bright flash of light...]
 
Q:      "Anything?  Ha Ha Ha Ha...."
 
PICARD: "Oh waves  of bliss...  All  we need now  is the Borg to  realy make my
         day."
 
                                                                           end.
