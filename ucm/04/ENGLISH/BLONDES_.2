                           BULLETIN NO. 91-92
                           ------------------

DATE:     January 7, 1992
TO:       All Ohio Insurance Agents
FROM:     Ohio Department of Insurance
SUBJECT:  Automobile Dimmer Switches

Pursuant to  the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles Act No. 97-12, all motor ve-
hicles sold in  the State of Ohio after February 15, 1992, will be  required to
have the headlight  dimmer switch  mounted to the floorboard. The dimmer switch
must be mounted in a position accessible to operation by pressing the switch by
the left foot.  The switch must be far enough removed from the left foot pedals
to avoid inadvertent operation or pedal confusion.

Included in  the above act and  beginning June 1, 1992, all other vehicles with
steering column  mounted dimmer switches  must be retrofitted with a floorboard
mounted dimmer switch of the type described above.  The steering column mounted
dimmer switch must be disabled or removed from the vehicle. Vehicles which have
not made this  change will fail the  forthcoming Ohio Safety Inspection program
which will begin on this date.

It is recognized  that this will  cause some  hardship for the  driving public.
However, this  change is being made in the interest of public safety.  Ohio DMV
Act 92-13 will revert all Ohio motor vehicles to the prevalent dimmer system in
use prior to the influx of foreign market vehicles. A recent study entitled the
"Inflation  Sequence in  Ohio Nightime Highway Traffic Accidents" was conducted
jointly by the  Ohio Department of  Motor Vehicles  and the  Ohio Department of
Motor Vehicle  Research.  It  has shown that  96% of all  Ohio nightime highway
accidents are  caused by a  blonde  getting  her foot  caught in  the  steering
wheel........
