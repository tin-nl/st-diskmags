             Interview with LIG LURY of NEW TREND, done by moondog
Ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At last here we have another interview with a former Atari coder of NEW TREND...


ÛUCM... - Hi andreas, long time no see! Since we started a row of articles in UCM
Û         that have  the aim to  discover what  former  Atari scener's  are doing
Û         nowadays, and since I stumbled over New Trends webpage some months ago,
Û         I decided to choose New Trend this time... so, how are you?

LIG.L. - I think that  things are going very well for me. But when I look at the
         list of questions in this interview I feel sad.... just kidding


ÛUCM... - I wont bore the crowd with always the same questions here, but a little
Û         excurs in  your computer  history  would  be  fine... so  how  have you
Û         started, what was your way and where are you now?

LIG.L. - I started 1985 on the Commodore with a VIC-20 homecomputer (3,5 kb ram)
         and developed  some games in Basic just for the fun of it. After that I
         switched to  the C-64 and spared  my free time gambling all those great
         games. Then finally  I arrived  on the Atari and stayed some years with
         it. I soon  started coding  assembler  and got  in touch  with the demo
         scene. I founded a groud called TCM and started releasing my stuff.
         After  joining  the  alliance  Electricity  we released the megademo "A
         grumbler in a rutting season" (does  anybody know this demo?). This was
         my last production on the ST.
         I joined New Trend and switched to the Falcon. I think this was my most
         productive  time.  But  after  releasing  2 Falcon  demos ("When dreams
         become reality", "Strange Circumstances") I smoothly went to the PC and
         started doing more serious programming.
         The first thing  was a game (is this serious?) called  Semtex for OS/2,
         this was a clone of the great Atari Dynabuster game from TSCC.
         After some time  I started programming  in Java and joined a Multimedia
         Company and  did 3 years of backend  coding for them. Sounds boring but
         earns my living....
         This year I  joined a new  company also as a  Java developer and that's
         what I am doing right now.


ÛUCM... - You were  the last  new member  that  joined N.T.  and that was in 1993
Û         after the  first  Fried Bits  party. You  were  known as Mr. Pee of The
Û         Cyclemasters  before. Can  you tell  us a  bit about your pre-New-Trend
Û         history? Was TCM the only  band you  were a  member of before? What was
Û         the reason to join New Trend in the end?

LIG.L. - As I mentioned above I was the founder of TCM and we were only 3 active
         members at the beginning. After some time the others got very inactive,
         that was the main reason why I joined New Trend.


ÛUCM... - New Trend  was one of  the first  demo groups on  the Falcon at all and
Û         since some of  the nowadays  Atari freaks  were still  shiting in their
Û         pants at  this time (just kiddin...) it would be nice if you could tell
Û         us a bit about  this times  of big changes in the Atari scene... how do
Û         you feel in view on the fact that you were one of the first Falcon demo
Û         coders? How it feels to be one of the founders of a new demo scene?

LIG.L. - I never  have seen it  this was :-) We didn't created something new, it
         was the same  thing on a new  machine. The  start on  the Falcon wasn't
         easy, there wasn't  many documentation  and the only thing  which I had
         known about the DSP was that DSP is written DSP......
         And if you look  at our first Falcon demo, you will notice that most of
         the effects  where coded  on the  ST (16 colors :-). We  just  used the
         power of the Falcon to boost them. I was the only New Trend member with
         a Falcon  at this time, so  I was the  only one able coding pure Falcon
         effects.


ÛUCM... - Unfortunately  New Trend was  also one of the first bands that left the
Û         Falcon scene, just after "Strange Circumstances" your second big Falcon
Û         demo. Why have you  quitted the  scene that  fast? Was this really your
Û         last production  or have you worked on some other stuffs that just were
Û         not finished?

LIG.L. - Only Mr.Bond anounced in the demo that he is leaving the  Atari scene.
         The others continued  the work  on the  Atari, but  we  never  released
         anything anymore after this point as far as I know.


ÛUCM... - What would you say today to the two New Trend Falcon demos if you would
Û         have to rate them? Are you satisfied with them in comparison with other
Û         demos that were released at that time?

LIG.L. - This is  a hard  question, both  demos were  really hard work finishing
         them. But I think we can be satisfied with what we have done.


ÛUCM... - Hehe... and  while I  mentioned "Strange Circumstances" above, I have a
Û         question to you that burns since long times under my fingernails, grin.
Û         What can you  tell me  about the fact that this demo was released for 2
Û         times, or better, that this demo was given in 2 competitions (DCC 2 and
Û         Fried Bits 2)? What  do  you think  today  about this  and what was the
Û         reason to do it?!

LIG.L. - The demo I have given in the DCC 2 compo was the pre-version of Strange
         Circumstances. It  was only  1/2 of  the effects  we put  in the  final
         version. And considering the fact that all  screens where rewritten and
         I added a lot  of smooth and  stylish transitions between the effects I
         don't think that both version are identical.


ÛUCM... - I know that you appeared on many other Atari parties, had you never the
Û         idea to try  to join  the active  Atari staff again, after  you saw the
Û         things that were going on?

LIG.L. - I am really impressed that the Atari scene  is still  alive. But I must
         say that I don't have seen any Atari demo stuff recently.


ÛUCM... - Except Dragon  all other  New Trender's disappeared at the same time on
Û         Atari, are you still in contact  with them, just  as to Mr.Bond, Dragon
Û         or Ice Cube?

LIG.L. - We have met at  some parties  from time to time. Mainly at the InterJam
         party where  I was one  of the organizers. But in the last years I have
         lost the  contact to nearly  everyone on  the Atari. The only exception
         was Inter  mainly because  we live in  the same  city and I worked with
         Samurai for the same company.


ÛUCM... - Since no one knows what happened to Ice Cube, maybe you can answer this
Û         question?

LIG.L. - Ice Cube is the brother of Mr.Bond, so he should answer this question.


ÛUCM... - I know that you were working on some game project on OS/2 together with
Û         LoST of Inter. It  was a  Dynabusters  clone called "Semtex"... at that
Û         time all wondered about the way to change to OS/2, can you tell us why?

LIG.L. - We started to develop the game for DOS and switched to OS/2 because the
         developing  for DOS is  a lot easier  on this  platform (no more resets
         when the games crahes :-).
         Then we did a port of the game to OS/2 because there weren't many games
         for this system and we wanted to change this. But "Semtex" was  a cross
         platform  game, we always  had a  DOS version  and since 1 year we also
         have a Windows version (thanks to Lucky).


ÛUCM... - What are you doing nowadays? I don't think you've stopped coding at all
Û         and so on what system are you working nowadays?

LIG.L. - I'm doing  E-Business applications with Java. I don't do many coding in
         my sparetime, but I have the dream to do a oldschool megascroll demo in
         a Java applet... wait for it.


ÛUCM... - Have you  still contact  to the  scene, esp. the  Atari scene? Are  you
Û         still  following  the  things  that are  going on  there or  aren't you
Û         interested anymore?

LIG.L. - Only to  Inter, we are  trying to  have some meetings from time to time
         and then we are talking about the good old times.


ÛUCM... - If you're still  following the things going on, what do you think about
Û         the nowadays Atari scene  in comparison  with the  scene as you were an
Û         active member?

LIG.L. - Sorry, I  have no plan what is going on today.


ÛUCM... - In just  one week  the Mekka/Symposium  party will take place again and
Û         since  1996  it  will  be  the  first  time  again that there are Atari
Û         competitions  held there... will  you attend to the party or aren't you
Û         interested anymore?

LIG.L. - I would like  to go to a big party again. Just for meeting some people,
         but  I think  I would  only come  for one  day and  I wouldn't  bring a
         computer at the party place.


ÛUCM... - At last some  questions about  your homepage. How  did it came that you
Û         put the page to the net, esp. since you aren't active for years? Was it
Û         some kind of memories to "better times"? And why it only deals with the
Û         falcon  productions? As far  as I  know  there were  several  New Trend
Û         productions  on ST as well but there are no screenshots and no files to
Û         leech there... is  it because  it  is  your  page  and  you  joined  as
Û         New Trend went to the falcon?

LIG.L. - The page  is still active because it was a good platform for putting my
         Java applets on. At the  time when I  made this page the good times for
         the ST where  allready over, so  I was to lazy to put this stuff on the
         page.


ÛUCM... - Hum, before  we come to  the end let's  have some brainstorming. I will
Û         give you a  bunch of words  and you just  have to write down the things
Û         that are coming  into your mind right after reading them... just answer
