                              WHERE TO GET UCM?!
ñ--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dunno where  you have picked up  this issue you're reading  atm but for a deeper
dive into the UCM ocean there  are several sources around, esp. that are dealing
with older issues as well. I wont list all download sources for UCM here, but at
least a few that are supposed to be the hottest sources.

Ok, since UCM is running  under the .tSCc. label, you can find the latest issues
on the  .tSCc. homepage. Some days  after the diskmag  release there  will by an
online issue as  well, bringing you the usual UCM feeling  onto your screen, and
here it doesn't matter what machine you're using.
So if you want to  leech the latest  issues of  UCM or read it online, check the
following page...

As known so far, we will  announce the  release of new  issues of UCM on several
bulletin boards as well. So you can find informations about a new release on the
following very important sites...

òhttp://www.atari.org

òhttp://www.dhs.nu

The DHS page usually offers the download as well without any crosslinks...


Furthermore a small download page  installed by  STRATAGEM of ANIMAL MINE offers
ALL  issues of UCM that were  released so  far, it doesn't  matter what label or
under which editorship. So go there for a fast download...

Last but not least another nearly  complete download page is standing in the net
as well, done by STsurvivor, who had taken over the editor ship from issue 15 to
issue 2o. Since he  claimed the  death of UCM with  issue 2o, this  page doesn't
offers later issues for download but since  all issues are  presented with small
screenshots, it's a very recommendet page... Check it at...

Ofcourse you will  stumble over  a lot of other  download sources as well, but I
wont bore you with too  much download links here since I think that are the most
interesting ones atm.
