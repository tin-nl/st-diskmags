Who are  SILENT WATERS? Good  question, indeed! This  electro/synth pop  project
from Eastern Germany  appeared somewhen in 1995  but never matched it  so far to
step into a brighter light and since the band had  to fight for its  survive all
the years of  its existence, it is  to understand that they're still sticking in
the underground, even after 7 years of existence.
Right after the  first album was released, two of the former band members around
Michael Thurm decided to leave him alone. The second  album was  released by him
alone with guest singers only and  only since Jana Enke joined  as new singer in
1998 the band was able to play some live gigs and to promote their synth pop.
Without any doubt  they reached their  biggest audience  as support  for the old
german eighties pop heroes ALPHAVILLE on their last tour in 1999.
Lately the band got a 2nd  singer but unfortunately  since their last longplayer
not much new material saw the light of day... I will check out what was released
over the past two years... 3 singles to be precise...


ñ                        UTOPIA BLUE 3ooo - released in 2ooo

"Utopia Blue 3ooo" is a refreshed  version of an  older song, originally written
for their debut  album back in 1997. Why a refreshed version? If you have red my
forewords  you can imagine why. Both  longplayers were  released before the band
got a real front  singer with  Jana Enke. And  since Jana  gave the  band a very
promising voice  they started to  re-release their biggest hits with their voice
again, and if you would know the original versions you would imagine why!
UTOPIA BLUE is one  of their  older "hits" and I  remember their support gig for
ALPHAVILLE here... At this  concert they  had played  the original  version, but
with Jana's  great voice... And  I have to admit  that this was one of the songs
that attracted me most and was a reason for  me to find out more  about the band
SILENT WATERS.

This single contains 3 versions of the song...

Original Version - 4:3o
Classic Version  - 4:48
Flooral Version  - 6:22

Without any doubt  the original version rocks the whole single. It's a light and
dreaming romantic pop song  or even  better a  ballad, ofcourse  living from the
singers  voice most  but also  the arrangements are  nice, always  stepping back
behind the voice...
The Classical version  is styled  with a lot  of piano and orchestra playing but
didn't matches it to leave the same impression as the original version.
Last but not least the dumb flooral mix matched it to destroy the slight magical
spheres around the song at all and  comes along as  strange mixed  disco stomper
that's only highs are the very strange sound collages. But after  all they don't
save the song from the dull remix idea... bleurgh!


ñ                            COMPROMISE - released 2ooo

This single is an very uncommon one for the works  of SILENT WATERS so far since
the artwork of the CD is a bit strange, showing a colt  accompanied by the words
"make a compromise and you'll survive".. a strange view on the things, isn't it?
Also the  style of the music isn't  very common with  the former work so far and
has it's biggest backflash with the voice of the singer.
Also this single features 3 versions of the song...

Radio Version   - 3:58
Classic Version - 5:13
Flooral Version - 6:29

The radio version is a quite ok pop song at all, a bit strange arranged but nice
to hear and it matches to stay in the ears for a while.
The classical version  starts with  very spheric  soundscapes, piano  and violin
play and brings  the clear voice of jana best to your ears and makes this to the
best version  of all  three and  matched it  even to  change  the  feeling while
hearing  this song  from the  poppy radio  edit to a very soft one that features
even some light  depressing moments... while the flooral version tries to make a
dancefloor stomper  out of the song, but only to mix up the song with harder and
faster beats and to stretch it a bit doesn't makes it at all...
So this mix reminds me hard to some dumb disco pop stuff... sorry to say...


ñ                            INSIGNIFICANT - released 2oo1

Interesting  to know  in my eyes is  the fact  that this  song started under the
label "JaneMichaels" at a band competition on the german radio station "Sputnik"
and was later  revealed as  SILENT WATERS production and they decided finally to
release it as  single. As known  for their singles, this one features 3 versions
as well...

Radio Edit      - 3:29
Classic Version - 3:52
Dance Version   - 6:15

This is  a very  common synth pop song  with a  slight melody  and unfortunately
mostly very  usual sound  collages  for that  kind of music. If  you would put a
bunch of songs of the current second row of femal voices synth pop bands and mix
this one into them, you wouldn't hear too much differences. The radio edit isn't
very impressive and only the voice of the singer gives it some life...
The dance  version isn't  of my taste as well and is going to make a bigger step
away from their older  releases as well, unfortunately in the wrong direction to
disco techno pop...
Only the clear  voiced classic version  matched it  with its  heavy use of piano
sounds, to  be more  interesting, but  it can't  save the  song from  it's fully
mediocre style at all.
Unfortunately this single shows the deepest creativity point of the band atm...

ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what's left to say... the  small output leaves the  impression to me that the
band lacks a bit  of inspiration, esp. when you check out all the remixes of the
normally quite good songs that offer ANYTIME some very shitty one that makes you
sick. I know, other  bands do  it as well, but  since they  matched  it only  to
release 2 (!) new  songs since  their  last  longplayer 4 years  ago, I  have to
wonder a lot, if they're really working on new stuff at all or if the project is
dying slowly?
Back at the  time as I  saw their support gig for Alphaville I thought "Wow, how
does it  come that  I never heard  of them so far?" and I thought that they will
have a  great future... but  now I wonder  a lot, are  they really  stepped over
their zenith already?
Hope the rumours  on their homepage  are real and  that they're working on a new
longplayer  since only with singles they cannot  survive very long and will kill
their few steps out of the dark...
