Here we  have something  that never  would  have seen  the light  of day if some
encouraged guy  hadn't pissed of the  rules by the maker  and released it to the
public since this production never saw the light of day. This encouraged guy was
Paranoid of Paranoia, who got this preview of the second and last Falcon demo by
the Amiga/PC group THE BLACK LOTUS several years ago... 

Since the demo shows in one screen an Orneta logo it is obvious that it was done
for one of those polish parties and in view on the presented effects it seems to
be sure that it was for Orneta'97. Hey, we're already in the review, or what?!

So here we go...

After several tries I figured out in what resolution the demo has to be started,
64o*48o*16... since in every other resolution it crashes.
After I started the demo it presents a short information screen, giving the info
that it is just a preview and not thought  for public presentation or spreading.
But does this rule still stand  after so many years? I don't think so because it
is obvious that the demo would never be released at all...

The demo starts  with a fast technoing  soundtrack, presenting an pixeled Orneta
logo and a known picture, showing bare titted girls with body paintingso in damn
low resolution brought together with a bumpmapper on the fast moving background.

This was removed from  the screen, giving  way to  zoomed credits, still on that
fast  moving  background, as well  as the  following greetings. Both  reveal the
preview state of the demo, since they are obviously incomplete.

The texture work in the background goes on, going more and more mad, zooming and
distorting, overlayed  and enlighted, then  it gets  faster and  darker, and the
picture of  a guy  already known  and used  in some  PC release, appears  on the
screen, transparent and giving view on the weird actions in the background.
Unfortunately the picture is presented again in a fucking low resolution :/

The whole thing  goes on a  bit, again bumpmapped and  finally the demo stops in
this screen, letting stay this effect on the screen eternaly...

Final words... Surely just a preview. The whole demo represents the Falcon style
               of the middle/late nineties with the heavy use of disting, moving
               zooming textures and bumpmappers. Unfortunately those are more or
               less the  only effects in  that demo, always presented in another
               way. The music is  a techno  module, hard, fast, matching  to the
               style of the demo, but not my taste really. The grafix are just a
               few, not bad, but  always seen  before, in the right and over all
               better  resolution. The  textures in the  demo are good  ones, no
               questions, esp. since they  don't  offer as ugly  colours as some
               later releases... but  after all  they don't  save the  demo from
               being mediocre...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  5o % - in comparison with the planned release quite ok...
effex.........  4o % - bumpmappers, disting and moving textures...?!
visuals.......  55 % - nice grafix, but resolution is too low, good textures
musix.........  65 % - technoing module, not the best but ok...
design........  6o % - the things matching together, nice transitions
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  54 % - you can imagine the age of the demo at any moment...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If... the demo would be  released at the time  it was planned  for, and if... it
would contain  several more effects and style, it surely  would have been a nice
demo, but today you can feel and see the dust on every byte...
