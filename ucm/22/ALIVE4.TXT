Here  it is again, ALIVE as  hell. With  the time  the posse  behind STS and CiH
seems to  have found some  way to release the  issues in regular time. Since the
EIL issue they matched  it to release the  followers in steps of 4 months adding
maybe  a few weeks more and  so ALIVE matched  it to  be some steady part of the
nowadays Atari scene.

Unfortunately the current issue  comes along without a new intro since the coder
of the intro didn't matched  it to finish it in time and so a release of a ready
magazine was better as to wait some  weeks more, even if I  really would like to
know what intro we missed now.

Anyway, this  issue is  again a fairly  big one, expanding  over the 7o articles
level and filling up a DD disk untill its  last edge. The support comes from ppl
that are known for their state-of-the-art work and so right after loading you'll
be impressed  by a nice  loaderpicture by EXOCET, made  in the  style of  the so
called "GrÅnderzeit" (founding  time, the  time around 19oo). It is  followed by
the also magnificent  menu grafix  by EDO, reminding a bit  to Leonardo da Vinci
with the two hands on top of the screen... On Falcon you can hear a nice tracker
music by  TOODELOO while ST owners only (?) can  enjoy the  works of 5o5, DMA SC
and last but not least TAO. As known you  can enjoy those  soundtracks on Falcon
as well but still  their use makes the Falcon a bit unstable but that is a known
problem...

Ok, enough  of the forewords... let's  browse through  the magazine. It contains
again a various collection  of articles, just  as a huge  scene corner with very
intersting party  reports from Alternative Party (CiH has put a lot of work into
that  adventure!) and  Paracon 3 (nice read  of 5o5's  Limburg adventures...) as
well as other  party informations. A special  thing to mention  is the "minimag"
article by CiH, making some  nonsense headlines  from real news  and happenings,
that was an origin of the old DBA magazine.
Another big part  is filled with  tech-specs of  several hardware  stuff for the
Falcon, just  as the  Eclipse PCI adaptor and  its sense or  nonsense for Falcon
users, written by Deez, stuff about the CT6o, Paranoid's view  onto an announced
new Falcon compatible computer (that  seems  to be a hoak, even it's name TOSter
reminds me more to Toaster ;)...) just for example.
Other parts are filled with the news (that turned out to be more a collection of
rumours since  you mostly can't get real deep informations) and  interviews that
feature our new coder REMO, the  makers of the new  Highwire webbrowser project,
Matt Us Alem from XTROLL and another newcomer from France, just for example.
Later on STsurvivor is telling stories from the french scene in past and present
as well as some things he remembers from all the Atari parties he joined and CiH
takes an Atari related look back onto the last year.

The reviews corner is filled with reviews of  the most recent scene releases, as
demos and games and so you can read about "Illusion" from PARANOIA, the releases
of SATANTRONIC, "ChuChu Rocket" and "Mem", just to mention a few. Also CHOSNECK
magazine got a closer look.

Ofcourse MARSS' internet  ripps aren't  missing and  he offers another  bunch of
NUON related articles but as you maybe already checked  in other ALIVE reviews I
am not so interested in that stuff, but maybe it  finds some interested readers,
even if I think that in times as the most people are connected via Internet, the
reason to ripp off articles from the Internet is turning to nonsense. Esp. since
you're interested in that  NUON stuff you will be  faster informed  by searching
for the related  homepages, esp. since on the consoles market the development is
damn fast.

So what else... there is  the known bunch  of all-over articles, featuring a big
bunch of CiH brain meltdowns, so  he invents the comeback of ASCII Nation, gives
hints  about having fun  with PC's and  so on. STsurvivor itself  offers another
Internet  ripp about dull ways to die and last but  not least there are some DVD
reviews and a lot more.

Finito... Hu? A nice read at, no question, even  if the magazine didn't features
any sensations or  reported hypes, but we have to admit that  there weren't much
actions on  the Scene in  the  times as  the magazine  was created, such  as big
parties or history writing releases...

Final words... -ALIVE 4- shows that the  team behind the magazine has found some
               well running  way in working  together and since it matched it to
               establish a wellknown name in the  Atari world with its  presence
               it got some more support  again by several  other freaks using it
               to express their thoughts. The work that is sticking in the texts
               is differing from author to  author and I  must admit that I have
               enjoyed CiH's work most  since he really  puts a lot of work into
               his very long and detailed  articles and furthermore  he uses the
               possibilities of the shell as good as possible while others often
               don't care too much about them.
