release.. o7/2oo1, thought as guestscreen for the "JAPEMO" megademo by HYLST

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"JAPEMO", "JAPEMO" and no  end in sight. Since  HYLST has released  a preview of
his 5 disx demo  already one or maybe even 2 years ago, and  since other people,
like STRIDER of TYPHOON are going the way to release the  screens they have done
for that project  as stand-alone screens, I really  wonder if this project still
has any future, esp. since HYLST released all his latest  work on effex and also
screens on his lately launched own homepage.

And on that homepage I  also found  this screen, the  latest release  of SINE of
IDEMLINE, you  remember?! It was  damn long time very quiet around this newcomer
and his  latest  release was  some dull slideshow  about Michelle Pfeiffer  if I
remember right, but  that was back in  2ooo or even 1999... But SINE of the one-
man-band IDEMLINE already brought  us some remarkable  screens, featuring a very
strange but own design and often quiet ok effex... So I wonder what will he show
us now...

"ZE ZGREENE", damn, very freaky, he surely  means "The Screen", hehehe.. Anyway,
his production got  right at the  beginning some plus  points because it runs on
any ST or Falcon with at least 1 MB of RAM (maybe  even less) and on any type of
monitor, except monochrome, grin :)

After starting the program  file, the screen turns  black and a pixeled grey IDL
logo falls  down, jumps a bit and after that  a white bar  runs over the screen,
leaving a text below the logo... All was removed and while a texture mapped cube
in blue/orange comes up from the  lower border, the title is zoomed in letter by
letter  in linevectors, filled  up a bit later  with white and  turning to grey,
while 2 other white bars bringing up some more text... And while all those stuff
is  happening on the screen, some  quite funky chip  music comes up, but I don't
know who composed it...

In back of the ZE ZGREENE logo some blue circles filled with a texture appearing
and blinking to  the beat of  the music... All things  disappearing, while white
bars building up the screen again, leaving the lines "Idemline presents a Screen
for Hylst Megademo"... and finally  some pixeled  mediocre Japemo  logo comes up
in the middle of the screen.

The the screen  turns black again  and some white line vector building is coming
in and as it  stays on  the screen  it gets filled with  some landscape picture,
above of it some IDL logo is turning around  its axes while  left and right some
grey waves are moving and overlayed, and  last but not lest  stars are flying in
the the  right direction. On the screen below the greetings coming up in a white
font. This screen looks quite  oldschoolish and  has the special IDL touch since
he seems to like grey/blue/orange/brown colours.

{*i zgreen2.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

After a while (just by  pressing space) the  screen looses  all the  colours and
stuff untill only the line vector object stays on the screen that is flying away
then.

The next screen brings  the known grey  Idemline logo and a  bunch of small blue
scrollers  in the  background, running in  different speeds. And  while  all the
scrollers disappearing again, some blue  vector cube that gets transparent while
flying  over the  Idemline logo comes up. Some  sentence in  small white letters
below the logo disappears in falling dots, the logo disappaears while the single
letters are flying around on the screen  and another effect comes up, showing us
several flags build of different  bobs. So this goes on  for a while with always
different bobs and sprites and different wave forms too.

Then the Idemline logo  comes in again, scrolls out and hup... we're back on the
desktop!

final words...

Long time  no see and  then IDEMLINE strikes  back with a quite nice production,
featuring mostly oldskool effex, like parallax scrollers, filled vectors, moving
sprites, vector  bobs and  so on, but  because of the  on going strange, but for
Sine typical design  with some real  nice ideas and transitions, the screen wins
a lot of plus points. The biggest  drawback in my  eyes is the fact that Sine is
working all alone and I really think  he would grow up  much more in a band with
the help of  other coders and  graficians... Anyway, that  intro  shows that the
french underground isn't dead at all. Nice and surprising release!

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  6o % - a few nice ideas, but also a lot of oldfashioned stuff
effex.........  65 % - moving sprites, text mapped vectors, line & filled vex
grafix........  55 % - a few mediocre logo's and pictures, textures are ok
musix.........  6o % - a question of taste, have heard better demo sound tracks
design........  7o % - strange but on going, fading, blinking, good transitions
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  62 % - a fairly ok demo but not the burner as stand-alone prod.
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After all I  have seen  so far from  the "Japemo" demo  this  would be  the best
screen, but after all I doubt that it will be released some  when and it is some
kind of crap to release all the single screens and previews of a demo before its
own release at all... On the other hand so this little  thingy was saved for the
freaks before it will stay on some harddisk for eternity...
