This little intro is just a small gift from  the guys who attended to the little
Sector One and Fun meeting, held in Holland this summer. The main things in here
were done by Fun's maincoder Earx with little help of Zerkman from Sector One.

The small intro itself starts with a small resolution selector, offering RGB and
VGA (6o and 1oo Hz). After choosing my destiny  the screen gets  black and shows
up some precalculating bar... that finally ends in a damn long fractal zoomer...
How long I  haven't seen  that effect  anymore?! I have to  admit that  the used
colours are  very eye tormenting, held in  blue up to  purple and pink... As you
can see above, no grafix man was involved... ugh... also the  resolution is damn
low in that screen and furthermore it gets damn slow in the end... too bad.

At the same  time a fast but nice  stomping soundtrack starts to  play, no dutch
hardcore gabber  techno junk... grin :)  It's a quite ok  soundtrack and matched
to the demo...

The thing goes  on with a  rotozoomer in a  more eye  friendly  texture, held in
grey/blue colours giving  us in some damn  colourful letters  the bands names...
and those letters destroy any retina while zooming into the screen... you know?

Only the next screen  saves you from getting  larger damages on your eyes, since
it brings the known black background accompanied with 3d bobs in different colz,
but not only forming several  objects, but also delayed, blurred, ending up in a
quite cool melt-o-vision effect. This screen is quite cool and I like it much.
It goes for some  time with that  effect, the bobs  are building up the names of
the bands again changing the colours anytime...

The last screen  brings us the  greetings presented in  some dots fireworks/fire
effect, but  this time the  chosen colours are  again damn ugly... and so you're
finally damn happy to see the black screen and the desktop again.

Final words... The intro is  for sure  hacked together in  a hurry, it  misses a
               straight design and  the help of a guy  who has  experiences with
               chosing colours, but as  you know, coders  don't have  a hand for
               that, hehehehe... Unfortunately I have to say that the parts with
               the worse colours are destroying a lot of atmosphere of the demo.
               Technical it  surely  isn't bad at  all, I like the  3d bobs part
               very much... also the music  is quite nice... but you can destroy
               a lot with missing design and ugly outfit :/

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  5o % - overall not state of the art
effex.........  6o % - dots fireworks, zoomers, blurred 3D bobs, fractal zoom...
visuals.......  2o % - in several parts the worst colours since long times!
musix.........  7o % - quite nice module
design........  2o % - only very few transitions, maybe the colours are design?!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  44 % - technical nice, outfit... err... sucks?
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This intro seems to give prove to the old meaning that coders can't design :) It
isn't a bad  intro at all, but even  if you're  hacking together  something very
fast you should have time to change the colours in more comfortably ones...
