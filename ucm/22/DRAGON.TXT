            Interview with Dragon of NEW TREND - done by moondog
Ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we have an interview with one of the older coders of the band, since he was
already a member as the band was still running under "SILVER BULLET FORCE".

ÚUCM... - Heja Juergen! Since we're working on some "Where are they now?" article
Ú         for UCM and  I decided to  dig out  New Trend  this time, it's  time to
Ú         reveal  your  history and I  hope you  aren't bored  to death  with the
Ú         questions that will follow... So at first, how are you?

Dragon - So far so good.


ÚUCM... - And again  the same  boring question as in all other  UCM interviews...
Ú         When did you started computing and please give us some hints about your
Ú         past, present and future in this case...

Dragon - I started coding  when I was around 13 years old, that was around 1987.
         I started with  Commodore VC20  (Coding in BASIC). After  that  I had a
         Commodore 128 (Coding in  BASIC and  Assembler).
         Some years later  an Atari ST (520) was  bought and I started coding in
         GFA-Basic and switched to Assembler and a little C.
         After 520 ST followed a 1040 STE and a  Falcon 030. Finally I was drawn
         to  the dark  Wintel-Site. That  was the  time I've  started  to  study
         technical  Informatics (1996 ). I finished study in 1999 and work since
         that time at Fraport AG ( Airport Frankfurt am Main) as a Web-Developer
         (Java, Servlets, JSP and so on...). In  private  sparetime  I code some
         C++. No Assembler any more.


ÚUCM... - Since you were  one of the "older members" of  New Trend, you can maybe
Ú         tell us  something  about "The Silver Bullet Force" then, since  it was
Ú         the predecessor  of New Trend  on the Atari ST. Maybe you even can tell
Ú         us the reason for changing the name of the group as well?

Dragon - The Silver Bullet Force  was a  rather small  group with (I think) only
         one coder named  Mr. Bond. I can't  tell very much cause I'm not one of
         the founders of the group. As I entered the group as a member it was my
         first group  ever. So I had no  experience with such things. It was the
         time I had first  contact with other  groups and was very proud to be a
         member of a scene group. I really can't remember the real reason why we
         changed the name of the group.


ÚUCM... - How did it came that New Trend changed completely to the falcon (except
Ú         Mr. Bond, who went to PC)? Have you never thought of doing something on
Ú         ST again?

Dragon - Oh, I think  that  was  a matter  of  evolution. After  having  so much
         computers  before it, was only  a matter  of time  changing  to another
         system. The  Falcon  was a  system  with no  existing  demos, games  or
         something like  that. So we had  the chance of doing some pioneer work.
         So we had enough to do and no more time for ST stuff.


ÚUCM... - Since New Trend  was one  of the first  bands  that coded  on Falcon it
Ú         would be nice if you could tell us and esp. for the freaks that weren't
Ú         active already that time, about this time of changes from the ST to the
Ú         Falcon scene. How do you  feel today in the fact that you were once one
Ú         of the first coders on Falcon?

Dragon - It was very  exciting because  no one had experience with it. The first
         things you  had to do  is testing the  performance. But after the first
         tests I was  very disappointed, cause you  could  not copy a 320x240x16
         Screen in  one frame... It  was exciting  to visit the first Fried Bits
         after having  a Falcon to see what other guys can do with it. Sometimes
         it was also disappointing cause not everyone changed to the Falcon. The
         fact that  I have coded nothing  really good in my pioneer times on the
         Falcon makes me feel not really special....


ÚUCM... - What do  you think  nowadays about  the 2 New Trend  Falcon demos? Just
Ú         tell  us your  views on  them in  comparison  with  other  Falcon demos
Ú         released in that time.

Dragon - So our  first demo was  not wallbreaking, but the other one wasn't too.
         But it surprised  me that  we've made  place 2 on the  party in Hamburg
         (68oxo Convention, ed's note) with  our  first  demo. We've  never  won
         something until then. One  driver for our  new Falcon Demos was the new
         member  Lig Lury. Without  him I think we never came that far. The only
         thing I've done  for that demo was the Intro-Screen with the Atari-Logo
         moving and rotating.
         Our Second demo was also our last demo together with Mr. Bond. So we've
         got many buuuuhhhs  while showing  the demo cause Bondi wrote something
         like this: "See u on PC". That was  one reason why we didn't got a good
         ranking. Some things  went wrong on that Fried Bits. So the other demos
         got better as we thought. We had no chance... But we never wanted to be
         the best... We wanted to have fun... That's the key.


ÚUCM... - You were once working  on a big game  project that is still in my mind,
Ú         "XMoon". Why  have  you  stopped the  works on the  Falcon version? Was
Ú         there a further developped version except the playable demo released at
Ú         the Symposium Party '96?

Dragon - Yes, that a  really sad story. I always  wanted to  code a game. One ST
         the only game I ever finished was "Bloody Run" (I think nobody knows it
         anymore).
         I started to  make another  demopart. As a little demojoke I've coded a
         simple 1 plane  scroller with a little shot'em up in the background. So
         the shot'em'up was so funny that I decided to make a game in TrueColor.
         But as always  when you're a  coder you are not able to make music, GFX
         and gameplay. So BDC from Aura decided to take the gameplay part and he
         found some gfx-man. First it was cool. The graphics for the first level
         were nearly  finished, the  gameplay not  perfect but good and the code
         was finished for over 8o percent. So we  released a  little demo at the
         Symposium  Party '96. After  that everything  changed. No  more grafix,
         even a second GFX man had no time to do it.
         We got a bit lazy and I started my study in 1996, so I had no more time
         to code on it. I'm very sorry for that, cause some people really wanted
         to have the  code from "XMoon", but I wasn't able to copy the code from
         the Falcon to  a CD. Last year we've done it at the geek gathering with
         some patience. But  I think no  one could get through this code anymore
         or even understand the german comments....


ÚUCM... - On the homepage, that  was closed down this year, it was mentioned that
Ú         you were working on a PC version after stopping the Falcon version, but
Ú         nothing appeared. So what can you tell me about this fact?

Dragon - Ohh, that was only a thought. But on PC I don't had the energy to do it
         furthermore.


ÚUCM... - Another game of the same  kind that was  developped and called "Painium
Ú         Disaster", created  by Anvil Soft/Cruor. As  I remember the XMoon posse
Ú         gave some kicks in their direction... what do you think about the other
Ú         game project, I'm sure you got the playable demo of the game...

Dragon - Mmh, I'm  not  sure. There  was  another  shoot'em'up  at  the  time we
         developed on the  XMoon project. Maybe  that's the  one. I've only seen
         the  demo-version  and I was  a happy that  the demo was not as good as
         XMoon. But I never  saw more from  that game and  we never got in touch
         with the developer from the other game.


ÚUCM... - And if you're still following  the Atari scene you  maybe got the info,
Ú         that "Painium Disaster" was  finally  released  last  year, as  it  was
Ú         laying ready to spread around on the coders harddisk for some years.
Ú         Aren't you  sad about  the fact  that "XMoon"  never  matched  it to be
Ú         released?

Dragon - Yes, I'm very sad about that, but I can't turn back time. :-(


ÚUCM... - Back to  New Trend... as  I stumbled  over your  PC related web page, I
Ú         wondered about the  fact that  you haven't  mentioned your roots at all
Ú         (just like New Trend). Have  you still contact  to the other members of
Ú         the band, just like Lig Lury, Mr. Bond and Ice Cube?

Dragon - Oh really? Yes, I'm  ashamed about not telling much about my roots, but
         there is so much to do... you know  time... Indeed I have no contact to
         Mr. Bond, Lig Lury and Ice Cube. I only have contact to the Aura people
         Chris, Aeon and BDC.


ÚUCM... - Since it wasn't possible to find any further information about Ice Cube
Ú         maybe you can tell me more about him and maybe what he's doing today?

Dragon - No, I'm sorry. You should ask Mr. Bond about that.


ÚUCM... - As far as I  know you were  the last of New Trend, coding on Falcon (up
Ú         to 1996 if I'm right). Do  you still  have your  Atari? Are  you  still
Ú         following  the movements  of the Atari  scene or aren't  you interested
Ú         anymore?

Dragon - Oh, I don't follow  the Atari  scene  anymore. There  are so much other
         things to do. There is  a beautifuly child  and my  wife, the  work, my
         little scheduler and so on... I'm very happy about the Nectarine Radio.
         It makes me very  happy to hear the  sounds from the old times. I still
         have my Falcon with all my sourcecodes on it (XMoon, demos and so on ),
         but I never use it.


ÚUCM... - If you're  still following the todays Atari scene, can you tell me what
Ú         you think about it in comparison with the old Atari scene?

Dragon - Sorry, nothing to tell.


ÚUCM... - I know that  you have coded  several stuffs on PC in the past, have you
Ú         ever thought  of coding  something  on Atari again? What  are you doing
Ú         nowadays at all?

Dragon - Oh, I think  the Atari time  was a great  time, but  I think I won't do
         something  for  it  again. Oh, in  my rare sparetime I  try to  make my
         customers happy. The  only thing  I'm  coding  today  is  my  Scheduler
         "Desk-Timer" which I started in 1997 (as a C++ practice).


ÚUCM... - Lig Lury  has created a New Trend web page... have you ever visited it?
Ú         Are you still  remembering that times as you were an Atari scener or is
Ú         this deleted from your memories?

Dragon - Yes, 2 Minutes ago ;-)  I'm  still  remembering  to the old times. As I
         said it was really great and will never be deleted from my mind.


ÚUCM... - Oki... we wont bore you any longer and will make some brainstorming now.

         Angel and Mr. Pink. I never  was a public  person. I decided to stay in
         the background  for all  the time  so I don't  know if some people ever
