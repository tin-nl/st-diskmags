                              WHAT COMES NEXT?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hehehe... the eternal  question. Since the last long  break wasn't planned and I
always wrote  about a quick  release of this issue  in the last UCM, I wont give
you bigger hints about  the forthcoming UCM, or at least about  the time it will
eventually be released.

So what about the release  date? Nothing is  set and will  be set. It depends on
the support we will get. The more  support, the earlier  it will be released, if
less it will take longer, of course. But  it depends also on the mood of the UCM
writers posse at  all and since only a very few writers supported me and no real
team is set so far, I can't give any promises and I wont as well.

But I will give you some hints about the contents of the following issue.

Of course we will squeeze  out some special people  at next, but I wont give you
any hints, except  the fact that  they vanished some  times ago, to come back in
another way  than expected. Furthermore we will break  through some frontier and
will interview people  that already appeared in older issues already, but now to
learn more about  their current movements  and views. So if you're active on the
scene nowadays, be prepared to get some new painful interview sheet.

Furthermore I will go  on with the series, started in UCM # 21... Where are they
now? And after we started in the underground with  Issue 21, stepped over a band
that was known  a bit more, I will  go to drag  some real  bosses into the light
next time. No hints given here, but it will be a damn huge thing, be prepared!
Just one thing is sure atm, that  this project will break all limits that I have
set in this series so far, using a lot of crosslinks.

After the  MEKKA SYMPOSIUM is  over and the Atari scene will have to stay over a
longer  time  without any  bigger party, we  will try  to take  a look  over the
frontiers, about things happening in the big thing called "demo scene" at all...

Another thing that is  missing this time, is the  UCM surftip since I hadn't the
mood in the stressy last days, to  check a homepage on  heart and kidneys. I had
one in my eyes, but finally I didn't matched it to finish it... so we will go on
next time with it...

Hum, anything  else? Dunno, some  big project  I started long times  ago must be
finished somewhen, why not next time? You'll see...

And, just  to close  this small  outlook, you should  look forward  to some more
shouting abuse and throwing things at your  monitors while reading controversial
articles in UCM  (to speak with  the words of some  famous UCM reader  who don't
wanted to be revealed in the feedback corner)...
