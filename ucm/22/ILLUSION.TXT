PARANOIA brings us lately another Falcon production before the band is going for
a longer break. As organisers of the PARACON 3 party they wanted to release some
demo on their own party and  they did and have won  the little competition. This
time they created some 64 K intro for the Falcon.

Their "ILLUSION" intro starts with some  greyscaled sayings, forming some poetic
lyrics, that are brought to the screen in a very special way as they are shaking
and flickering in some way. After a few of those  sayings the screen makes place
for the first  effect, this time in colour and it is... a fire  effect and while
the fire is burning on bottom of the screen a razorblade is  flying above of the
fire, burning  as well... hell?! A burning razorblade?! How did  they matched it
to make steel burn!? And is it still sharp afterwards?! Questions over questions
I didn't found an answer for so far.

Ok. Maybe I'll find  them in one of the following screens? The next one shows an
Illusions logo, in  greyscales again. Hu? What happened? Is  it some kind of new
style or turned my VGA in a greyscales monitor? Who knows and it doesn't plays a
role since  the logo starts to  dist and swing, zooming in and out more and more
untill  it's deleted from  the screen and  finally the  intro founds the colours
again for the next effect.

And as we all  know that PARANOIA are tunnel lovers the  next effect is a tunnel
effect and maybe they have saved the colours in the former  screen to smash them
now into our face, since the tunnel cames along as a red dominated colour melter
that disappears right before causing bigger damages on the eyes.

It's time  for the last  screen, bringing  some greyscaled  saying again, acting
like the ones in the intro and building the end of the lyrics that started there
and  finally some  Atari/Paracon 3 logo stays on  the screen, still  shaking and
flickering untill you smash space to come back to desk.

final words... This is a true shizophrenic intro, on the one hand the greyscaled
               intro/outro and roto zoom part that  spread some sober atmosphere
               and at the other hand the parts with overflooding colours. I like
               intro and outro very  much, nice idea, but I wonder  why they did
               not tried  to step through  the whole intro  with that greyscaled
               idea. The effects  aren't bad and clean done but not state of the
               art anymore. On the pixels front  there is the illusion logo that
               looks a bit  worse without  colours. The  design is  dominated by
               some small effects in cleaning up the screen from the effects but
               black is the dominating colour anywhere in the background. A more
               constant  use of greyscales  or chosing not  as biting colours as
               in the tunnel screen would have been much better.
               What's left, the  music. An Amiga style  chip module, as  used in
               older Amiga cracktros.

originality...  65 % - nice idea with the intro/outro
effex.........  5o % - burning razor, disting rotozoom, tunnel (...)
visuals.......  4o % - a few transitions, ok grafix but in greyscales?!
musix.........  65 % - old skool chip module, surely coming from Amiga
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  55 % - a quite nice 96ktro with interesting in/outro
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like atmosphere of intro/outro but I don't know how to handle the colour flash
in two of the screens, esp. the tunnel part breaks a lot  of the feeling and the
style of the intro...
