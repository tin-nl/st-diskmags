                            ATARI CONSOLES GAMING NEWS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is still something going on on the Atari consoles. This time we just bring
you a  bunch of LYNX  and JAGUAR related  informations but I'm  already thinking
about the point to include ANY Atari consoles related  snipped next time since I
checked out  that there are new games  for the Atari 52oo are in the pipeline as
well... The problem is that I'm running out of time atm and since the more Atari
machines will be included here the more news are to find, this would be a really
endless story and I have to cut it somewhere...

                                    ATARI LYNX
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALIEN VS PREDATORS

Last year a  prototype ROM of that  game appeared first  time on several EMU and
ROM sites. It features a playable version  of the game that  was announced since
many many years for the LYNX but never made it to a final release at all.
Unfortunately all  ROM sites of my knowledge  that featured this ROM closed down
or were out of order, so lately it  wasn't possible to leech that file anywhere,
but since I already leeched it last year we can bring you a sneak preview onto a
game that would have burned out your LYNX for sure... Check my review here...

"CYBERVIRUS" by SONGBIRD

Another game that will not make it this year. Even if Songbird is already works
since last year on this game (that was already started before by Beyond Games),
it was again postponed, now to 2oo2...

"DISTANT LANDS" by SONGBIRD

Bad news about this  role playing game. First announced for  release this summer
it was postponed now untill spring 2oo2...

OTHER NEWS...

Since it is damn quiet for  some years now around the LYNX heroes BASTIAN SCHICK
and MATTHIAS DOMIN, two hardcore coders and developers from Germany, another guy
joined the LYNX homebrewer forces  that should be well known to the most of you:
BJ™RN SPRUCK, better known as SAGE, former member of ESCAPE and coder of several
Falcon screens and modules for the famous TWILIGHT screen saver. He has a lot of
ideas and projects  on the start. Besides  the 1oooth version of PONG, BREAK OUT
and so on he works on a conversion of "BUNION CANYON" to  the LYNX. A first demo
looks very promising since the grafix are  drawn by FLASH of .tnb. and reminding
hard to the Falcon original by the RESERVOIR GODS. Furthermore he thinks about a
conversion of "DYNABUSTERS" to the LYNX.

                                ATARI JAGUAR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a bit quiet around  the Jaguar lately. The only officially announced game
atm was "PROTECTOR SE" that was  postponed again. But finally the news came from
another not expected side...

"BATTLESPHERE GOLD" by SCATALOGIC

This game was released out of a sudden, nobody expected  it and so it was a real
burner since it  is the "Directors Cut" of  the game, featuring  new and  better
grafix, animations, hidden  bonus  games, and  loads  more. Check  out the whole
stuff at the following website...

http://www.scatologic.com/


Furthermore there was a homepage opened with  the aim to support  the players of
"Battlesphere" and "Battlesphere Gold" with always the latest codes and cheats..

The information that the works  on the game "GORF PLUZ" were  continued couldn't
be verified  since the homepage of  the makers is down atm.  But new screenshots
appearing here and there seem to give prove.

The game "NATIVE" that was a project  of the development  team DURANIK, that are
known because of  their great Break Out  clone called "IMPULSE" on Falcon, seems
to be dropped. The homepage closed down and as far as I know the development was
dropped already longer time ago. This seems to be not enough since game and link
were announced again and again on several sources (even if the links are dead!).

More to come next time...
