                           ATARI PARTY CALENDAR 2k2
Ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I have  collected a bunch  of informations about  forthcoming Atari related
events and conventions. As you will see the actions are spread over whole Europe
that will make it hard to attend to every show, but maybe you will find an event
in yours surroundings so  that you can at  least show there that the Atari scene
still rocks...

Û2o./21.o4.o2           ATARI PARTY 2k2

This event will be  held in Spain (!) and will be  organized by Tito Teclado and
TOSTech. If it is a real party or a meeting with the touch of a fair isn't sure,
but it is  thought for  any Atari system  including all clones and consoles. You
can visit the party related homepage:

Úhttp://perso.wanadoo.es/titoteclado/atariparty/y2k2/

But take care, the whole stuff on the page is written in spanish!

The party will run over both days and the night  as well, and will take place at
Centro Juvenil Mercado San Gregorio (the  youth center) in  the  city of Torrent
nearby Valencia.

The entrance fee is just 3 Euro!

You can mail the organizer via: titoteclado@apdo.com

If you're thinking  to make holidays in  Spain at this time, why not checking it

This quite traditional happening will take place also this  year again. The page
belonging to it can be found on the homepage of the  Svenska Atari Klubben under

Úhttp://www.sak.nu/

This year the party will be held on the eastern coast in Oskarshamn (a beautiful
small city... I was there several times!). It will  take place  at a location in
the IngenjîrsvÑgen 65, at Oskarshamn. Starting  on Friday about 7 PM and lasting
untill Sunday (even over night this time) 5 PM.

The  partyplace will  offer  the  possibility to  stay over  night as  well as a
broadband  internet connection... restaurants, shops  and cafe's  will be in the
near surroundings. The entrance fee for all days is 1oo SEK (about 15 Euro).

Û3o.o8. - o1.o9.o2          UNCONVENTIONAL 2k2

This is the third Unconventional Party this time and since the only  possibility
of a party for 16/32 bit  Atari systems  in middle  Europe this  year, the MEKKA
SYMPOSIUM wasn't really accepted by the Atari scene, this could be the event...
Check out more at...

The party will start at Friday at 8 AM and will last untill the last visitor has
left the rooms on Sunday. It will take  place on the  same place as in the years
before, in the local "SchÅtzenhaus" in Lengenfeld/Vogtland, Germany.

It is  organized by  Mad Butscher / Foundation Two  and  Helmut Weidner from the
ABBUC, so the  party will surely 8bit dominated, but after all it depends on our
selves since all Atari systems are welcome...

The party will feature the usual competitions  as well as gaming competitions on
several  systems  like 8bit, Lynx and Jaguar, as well  as fun  competitions like
golfing in the garden :)

After all the entrance fee is... nothing! You can get in for free!

Ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it atm for truly Atari  related events. I know  that local  Atarians also
will go to several Amiga/PC parties, just like the VIP 4, but since that parties
aren't thought for Atari at all I wont mention them here...
