     PS2: Summoner - Born of fate, raised by prophecy, destined to destroy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Born  with  the mark  of the  Summoner, Joseph  possesses  a power  greater than
emperors and  gods. As a  child, he  summoned  a demon  to save his  village and
watched in horror as those he loved were destroyed. Nine years later  the armies
of Orenia invade and Joseph must confront the prophecy he was born to fulfil.

I am a great fan of  RPG games and  so I had  to buy an  RPG game. As  a Swedish
magazine had reviewed Summoner as the best  RPG on PS2 I  had little  choice and
had to buy it. And I do not regret my choice. It has the most common ingredients
of a RGB game; the  prophesy, the evil, the magic  and an armada  of weapons and
items to find and buy. It is huge and will takes ages to complete and  even then
I will have missed most of what is there. 

You control Joseph and later on more  heroes that  joins your  adventure. Mostly
you walk around pressing (X) button when you encounter something interesting. On
your way you speak to people that helps you  on your quest, has small  tasks you
can complete for  reward or  simple ignore  you. There are  traders, farmers and
noblemen all wandering  about doing their  business in  the cities. The  game is
HUGE!  

The size of the game, the many side quests and the pure gaming. You control what
you need to if you do not care it can be handled automatically but less accurate
that manually so you still are on the edge when the big  monsters come. I really
enjoy the grand music that sets the mood.

Not only is the  game world  huge they have  made everything  huge. What in real
world should be a few meters can very well be dozens of meters in the game. That
leads to allot of running just to get there. And the maps should have markers on
them pointing  out important  places very  much like in  Baldurs Gate. I can not
remember where all  1000 shops are and  immediate  find them so I  find my self-
running around searching way too often.
And the graphics  quite frankly  suck, especially the Z clipping in distance and
the extreme low polycount on most characters.

 - Graphics: 4/1o - Sound: 9/1o - Controls: 8/1o - Fun: 7/1o - Overall: 7/1o -
