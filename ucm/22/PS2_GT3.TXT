            PS2: Grand Turismo 3 A-spec  - The real driving simulator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is not much of a story, as matter of fact I have found no trace of a story
line. This is  a driving simulator  and it ends there. Not  to say that  that is
little but  it leaves  not much  for the  introduction of  the game so lets jump
right ahead to...

My first impression of the game.

The first time I saw GT3 was at IMP13 this summer. As all visitors of IMP since
its new  facilities there  is a TV in  the room "just ahead", usually  it plays
some MSX, shows sports or is simply turned off. This time it was on when I went
into the room and glanced at it and saw a car race, as sports don't interest me
much I was about to leave when I got a strange feeling and had to have a closer
look. Was that really TV, no wait a minute it's a game! Or is it?
I marvelled at what was produced by NoCrews PS2 for a while until I had my turn
to try it out. I have  never been a fan of car games so I had not much hope but
I liked the graphics. After a race I realised I had an adrenaline rush. I think
this little  tale pretty much sums it up, it is damn good looking and  actually
has game play that even I a hardcore NONE racing gamer can enjoy.

So what is the game actually about then?
Well there  are two  ways to  play: Arcade mode  and Grand Turismo mode. Arcade
mode is actually  quite a  few modes such  as single  race, time attack and two
player races. It is  quite straightforward choose your mode, your car and drive
away. Just a few  exceptions, time attack  races is  with a fixed car, and only
single race lets you choose difficulty.
It is very good for killing time, racing  friends over a beer and  training for
what's ahead. What's ahead is Grand Turismo mode.
In Grand Turismo  mode you start  out with 18.000cr, using that you shall buy a
car, do not worry there is over 150 cars to choose from. And then you race!
Winning races  earns you money and  using money you can fine tune your car with
new tyres, new  transmissions, new virtually everything! And ultimately buy new
cars. Winning cups can also award you a new car. And so you build your fame.

The highs with the  game are  definitely  the graphics and the  game play. Both
works to that feeling of actually being there. I sit and  move my controller in
the air like Mom and kids do and my heart beats faster. I really like the races
with Rally cars, they  works extremely  well with beginners as well and tend to
be allot more fun over a friendly beer.
Amazingly enough the replays are just as fun as actually playing, there is even
a "music video" replay mode. Quite funky indeed.

The lows are few but they are there never the less. Not all tracks are choosable 
with single  race and in two  player games. It  really sucks  as the  only Rally 
track  is  Swiss Alps  and I  know it  pretty  well now. All  tracks  should  be
available!
And secondly there should  be some kind of hint system in Grand Turismo mode for
beginners  to  help  in  what  to  upgrade  the  car  with. As I know nothing of
transmissions  brakes and  such I just tend to make my cars unusable after a few
"upgrades".
