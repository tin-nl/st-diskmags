After the desastrous  release of  the "FOREVER 2E3 SLIDESHOW" it didn't took too
long time untill  the force from the carpates, far away in Slovakia, is striking
back with another release on ST, this time they bring us some real (?) intro for
the ST, at least the title leaves us this hope...

One point that shocked  me more or less was the second  appearance of mOdmate of
Checkpoint as musician in a real production! Eeeeh! But I must say that his lame
cover of a wellknown music theme isn't kicking  very well and reminds me hard to
some old skool tries to convert old songs into module format... Anyway, that was
a first surprise for me.

The intro itself  starts with a white  text on black  background, saying "PLANAR
INTRO - Or anything in  bitplanes"... so we will see. The first thing that comes
to out screen  is a converted photo in the background, in damn  dark colours. In
front of it 4 different sprites or better  shapes are  flying around, enlighting
the parts of the picture and after  a while the whole picture was discovered and
shows some guy with fingers sticking in his mouth, done  in greyscales that show
that some better converting methodes are known now in eastern Europe.

After that  the first  big punch  into my stomach came up... A very  ugly screen
brings us RGB stars, or better a starfield  with red, green and blue stars, this
comes along with a horrible Satantronic logo drawn in a few lines. This pain was
staying a while on the screen and after that follows the best part in some way.

This one  is called "New Age  plasma" or "Caleidoscope". There are  moving waves
scrolling in  all directions, overlaying each other  and giving a very colourful
mix then. I wouldn't call it plasma  at all since I have another idea about that
effect, but  after all the coder  showed some creativity, even if  it looks very
strange and a bit ugly as well.

After this abstract  screen follows  just the  end screen with  credits and info
from the coder.

Final words... There isn't much to say except that this is the first demo-a-like
               release on ST by SATANTRONIC. The things they  are showing us are
               down down below of any taste frontier but therefore they're going
               to increase the quality bit by bit in comparison with their other
               releases  so  far... Anyway, PLANAR intro  is only  something for
               hardcore freaks because it could cause vomit... It doesn't brings
               us special grafix and  effex, design seems  to be an unknown word
               so far in Slovakia...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  15 % - for the strange caleidoscope screen
effex.........  1o % - sprites, stars... "new age plasma" huargh
visuals.......  1o % - no design, ugly pixels, mostly horrible colours
musix.........  5o % - some tracker conversion by a grafician...
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  21 % - this intro can cause the same as the abuse of alcohol
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, it isn't all other that a promising  release but after all it shows that the
freaks from eastern  Europe are  workaholics and  if they  will go on  with this
release speed and increasing skills we could see some better output soon...
