                                    all day
                              hiding from the sun
                           waiting for the golden one
                             waiting for your fame
                           after the parade has gone

                           outside was a happy place
                  every face had to smile like the golden face
                                  for a second

                   your knuckles white as your fingers curled
                     a shot that was heard around the world
                                  for a second

                 it took seconds of your time to take his life
                                it took seconds

Hello folks...

...finally, after  a break of one  full year, we're  back with another  issue of
your  favourite or  most hated magazine, UNDERCOVER, and sometimes  I thought it
will never be reality again after that "glorious" comeback with issue # 21.

So, how did it came  that we had such a  long break? Well, there are quite a lot
of different reasons.
At first I  already started to  build on my own house  as we released issue # 21
and since this was  more time consuming as I  thought, UCM must step back behind
my building site  and my family, once  again. And as I checked out that it would
not be possible to release it in short time, I finally decided to lay it on ice.
So the time  passed by and not much  was done, two  possible release  dates, one
time around the  Unconventional Party and the other one around Xmas 2oo1 weren't
hold. Finally  I decided to set a  deadline in March  since I found some time in
February to clear up the  things. So the biggest part of  this magazine was just
done in February/March this year, including  the things that were done long time
ago for the UCM 22 planned in summer 2oo1.

Another reason, and maybe the most important one, was the point that we got only
a very few supporters, the release  of UCM # 21 brought not much  feedback, even
if many people forced me  to the step  to go on with  UCM before. Several people
announced me to  help out with articles and stuff but finally only a few finally
did it. And since this lack of support  my motivation to force the works even if
my time was shrinking, was laying down. In some way I must thank those two guys,
who wrote articles for UCM, even if they never  knew what was going on  with UCM
finally, namely those guys were  Mad Butscher and Peylow... thanx guys! Lately I
have to thank my .tSCc. chaps as  well since they  ignored in the  first time my
works for UCM # 22 nearly completely, but  changed their mind this year and gave
me as much support as possible, esp. in a time that is very timeconsumpting 'coz
of other big crew projects.

But hey, end up that crap... with a lot of work we matched it and I'm happy that
we got at least so much  support on  the artworks  side that we  or better I was
able to  concentrate on writing and  organizing alone. If  those people wouldn't
have offered their help, this quite fast release since the official deadline was
set, never would be possible.

So what? This UCM is again a damn mixed  thingie, again with  a lot of old craps
that were  written before the big break. I hope  you aren't bored  too much with
all those old reviews  and craps but I decided to put them in here anyway, since
it was a lot of work and I wont skip it.
But I  hope that we can  offer you some interesting  views onto the scene again.
Unfortunately the heavy rush in the last  two months, in working out  the things
that were laying down  so long, handicapped  us much in  following  the roots we
started in UCM # 21.
Ok, we hope you like it anyway... and stop reading this boring editorial that is
just filled with lame self justifyings...

                  yours, moondog . ucm-main-editor from '93-'98 & 2k1 and beyond

update... Yes, We already  have april  and this damn  magazine isn't finished...
          Today I decided to  give up in assembling all  the missing files, that
          means the rest of the articles I wanted  to do, have started but after
          all never finished. I'm totally  fed up with the hard work since it is
          eating all my free time since  about 14 days now  and I'm some kind of
          burned  out  yet, esp. since  the magazine  is some kind  of ready and
          there isn't a real sense  in the fact  to wait some  more days just to
          finish some old stuffs... I think the things will look better if it is
          out finally  and I can  lean back a  few days... I already have enough
          stuff in my mind  I want to do for  UCM 23 then and  I must see that I
          don't mix up all the stuff since in my mind I'm already working on the
          next issue and that causes a lot of confrontations with this one here.

          Yes, that's it!                                   moondog . 1o.o4.2oo2
