system... Falcon, 8 MB RAM (doesn't matter if ST or FastRAM), VGA

size..... 1,7 MB on harddisk

credits.. you should know the mad swedes

release.. Error In Line 2k1

Ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And the SPICE BOYS  did it  again, as the last  surviving "fake demo"  band. But
since the most other  released crap, the  SPICE BOYS always matched it to create
some funny demos, as well as demos that feature sometimes also some good codes..

Such as "PIZZA"... This demo is dedicated to the PIZZA killing swedes that liked
the ERROR IN LINE parties for their  PIZZA deliverer, who  offered Family pizzas
of 6ocm * 4ocm in size, that  were loved by  the swedes. This times, the SPICEYs
created their second educational demo btw...

After they brought us  a demo to  learn basics  in swedish, this time  they will
educate us in  biology, since they  will draw  us the  way of a  Pizza through a
swedish coder... The guy who was used for that tests is known as Evil...

So the demo starts with an eating sequence, brought  in a small animated picture
by showing the  delinquent in  eating a pizza  slice. Now  the journey  into his
throat begins, and after it  was smashed into  the acid  bath at the stomach, it
goes on to be pressed through the guts, and under the big pressure of the guy it
is formed into a bowel, a nice brownie...

The whole passage cames along with very natural  sounding stuffs, giving you the
right noises about eating, pressing and shitting... This isn't far away from the
hard reality! Well done!

Wow! What a nice  show of the  things happening  in the stomach-guts-part of our
body! But after all I  really wonder why my own bowels  are looking so different
from the  shiny tiny little brownie  they offered in  the demo... hummm... Is it
because of the Pizza or something? This question will stay unanswered I think...

Oki... let's cut  that crap... After all  this is a fake demo that features real
technical stuff like waterdrops effect, textured tunnel, mapped vectors and env-
mapped vectors as well. Furthermore it features MP2 musix but in some way I have
to admit that the soundtrack could be done with a tracker module as well...

ÚFinal words... a real funny  demo with a very  strange humour  that gives  prove
Ú               that the  so called  SPICE BOYS are  ruling that demo sector, but
Ú               since they're the only fake demo makers nowadays, they don't rule
Ú               really... Unfortunately, since  besides the included  jokes their
Ú               demos nearly always feature  clean technical  stuffs and not just
Ú               garbages on the screen.

Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  7o % - cool idea, really educational, state of the art fx
effex.........  8o % - environment mapping, texture tunnels, water drops...
visuals.......  55 % - funny grafix, quite ok textures
musix.........  7o % - an unspectacular soundtrack, funny samples!
design........  4o % - here it lacks a lot, but it's just a fake demo
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  63 % - Maybe one of the best fake demos ever!
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo is  one of the most funny releases, too bad  that it's bigger hardware
requirements will leave out several people.
