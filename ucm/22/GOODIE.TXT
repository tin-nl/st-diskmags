Yes, this time  we have them and I hope we  can bring you something special this
time, hopefully nobody has seen so far or maybe he has seen it  but never got it
at all since  it wasn't thought for spread. But  now, over 5  years after it was
done, it reached us over some dark channels and we're happy that we can bring it
to you, even if the dust of those 5 years glues like tar on it...

So what is it? We have three screens to bring you, called ò"Who Is A Rock"ð... All
those screens are the last official seen code work by Seboz aka Kyne of Spirits,
who left the scene 5 years ago. The first two versions of that screen were coded
in October  1996 and  even if  they were  ready  they  weren't  released  on the
INTERCONVENTION'96  since the  coder was  following  his rule  that  coding is a
complete waste of time... and so he don't wanted to release them there or better
never...

Strangely he has  done another  improved version in  January 1997, killing a few
more bytes, squeezing the whole thing together to just 2,7 KB, but in the end it
wasn't released as well. Happily some guy got his hands  on it and gave it to us
and so you can check out this 4K intro, presenting a nice bumpmapper and running
on RGB and VGA.

This  intro shows  us the  spirit where  Seboz was finally  living in, since the
title is just  reminding to some psalm from the bible. Unfortunately this screen
is another sign  for the fact  that the  Atari scene  has lost a  very promising
coder with  him. Too bad... and to contradict Seboz' meaning that coding is just
wasted time I have  to tell him that  nothing is wasted  time as long as you can
entertain  someone, as long as  someone likes it, as long as you get any kind of
feedback as well...

I accept  his decision  to leave  the scene, but I  wont accept  his reasons for
doing so as I remember him to be a very fanatic hardcore coder who was trying to
beat out the shit of ST and Falcon... And who is sitting over nights in front of
his machines, trying to  optimize his routines again and again, can say that all
is senseless or he must have got a completely brainwash.

After all I'm happy that  we saved at least this  little 4K intro for the public
and I hope you like it, even if it's damn old...
