release.. ERROR IN LINE 2K1 - ñranked 2nd in the Falcon demo competition

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, here we  come to the  second rocking  demo from the ERROR IN LINE party and
while the first one  rocked on a plain Falcon, this one burns  down any hardware
you can get  hold of, the  more the  better. But not  that it wouldn't  run in a
perfect way without those hardware extensions, nope, without  them you can right
delete  the files again... So go away  if you don't  have enough  memory  and at
least a FPU in your Falcy. The kings are  ofcourse the ones who have a real fast
accelerator card working in their Falcon, and I mean real fast  because the demo
gives a shit about simple 32 MHz speeders and CPU doublers...

Anyway after a  long break with  big productions  also the force  from the North
striked back, with a very special named  demo, yeps... the title  has big sense,
because it plays with all the discussions that happened over the past months and
years, about  the problem  of using the FPU, about  the problem to code for fast
accelerated Falcons, about the problem to use  MP2/3 music, about the problem to
use no standard machines at all anymore and  so on, and I believe  this demo was
thought to show that the DEAD HACKERS just give a shit about all that stuff :)

Ok, since I have at least the parts of the hardware to start the demo, I will go
over to the review now...

The demo starts  with the known  menu where you can chose the  display including
the screen frequencies and the detail modes and since I checked the demo out not
for the first time, I took the low detail mode, grin...

The screen  turns black  and a after a while some music starts  to play, while a
white bar appears on the screen, splitting and  scrolling up and down  a bit, to
make place for a real cool  idea... you see a lot of little porn pics, some with
red and some with blue  background, scrolling around  and zooming  back and with
the time you  can imagine  what is built of them and suddenly, with a hard noise
from the music, that  goes over into some technoing track, a white bar goes from
left to right, changing the pornpix into a pixeled DHS logo by EXOCET, real nice
idea! The logo is very good and features Exocets very own dither techniques...

After the whole  thing is fades  out, a texture  fills up the  background and an
vector atari logo, surrounded by 5 vector cones, is moving around on the screen.
The whole stuff isn't only  env. mapped, no, while the music starts to pump more
and more, on the sides of those cones, directed to the  Atari logo, lightsources
starting to glow, enlighting the whole scenery more and more... really cool!
This goes on for a while untill all 5 cones are enlighted.

The next part features a lot of flares on the screen, moving around in many ways
and several slogans  coming up on the  screen, like "fpu is cheating", "oldskool
rules", "stniccc boycott" and  "mp2 ruins  the scene"... yes, with  the title of
the demo the DHS guys offering their views onto all the  discussions and in some
way they surely laugh about it, because they have  broken the oath, grin... but,
to say it right now, it was cool that they did so...

{*i dont1.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

Ok, the screen changes, with  nice white  flashing transition, to the  next high
peak, featuring  some transparent looking env. mapped  torus, accompanied with 4
other objects, that are  all enlighted by a big yellow lightsource... looks very
weird and is a must for all extacy fanatics, should be a cool trip...

{*i dont2.pi1 m 0 20 0 199}

After the known break it goes on with  the credits part, the credits are zooming
backwards in front of a disting and  moving texture, and suddenly they zoom back
again, through  the sight of the viewer. Also  nice done but in  comparison with
the other shown effex, not the burner at all...

This screen  is followed  by a real  nice hires picture  by Lance of Aggression,
showing some bird that seems to be built of metal at  some points...  After that
the screen  turns red  and while on  the right side a pixeled  girl by Exocet is
appearing, on the left  is popping some  dithered stuff up, leaving enough space
in the middle  to present some very  complex vector  that reminds  a bit to some
doubled mushroom. The whole thing is grey/blue textured and bumpmapped.

After a while  to check  it out and  say boah, the  vector is  removed  from the
screen, the pixels are fading out and another red stuffy texture appears  on the
screen. The coming effect  is a bit hard to  describe, some flares  stuff again,
in style of old shaded bobs or dots stuff maybe, anyway. The flares are going to
be more and more and moving  around on the screen, and the credits are displayed
in the lower right corner.

At next another thingie comes up, this time you can see delayed morphing vectors
turning  around on  the screen, a good effect but falls  back slightly after all
the wow effects so far... but no fear... there  is still coming  some more thing
to make you say "boah" ;)

The last effect  of the main  part is a  flight over a textured  landscape, with
hills and lakes. I know, this isn't new as all but since it gives the impression
that the horizon is sinking into some fog it looks real stunning... Since it is
the last part just one thing is missing, the end...

And this comes along  with another  real cool MP2 soundtrack by Candyman, and he
uses massive 3o3  acid bleeps now, and I must say I like that  tune much more as
the main track that seems to repeat itself a bit too much. This comes along with
some thanx by the DHS posse to the people who helped them out and not to forget,
some morphing environment mapped vector object in the background. Also this part
of the demo  got some timing, in the way  as the whole screen  is enlighted when
some special samples in the music coming up... cool thing... Over and out...

Final words...

What to say, without any doubt a demo you can show also the  PC freak next door,
but only if your already boosted Falcon got it's final kick with a Centurbo card
or maybe  Afterburner as well. I wont say it is  too  slow to watch  on a 16 MHz
Falcon, and if you take low detail mode it  is much more fluous than some polish
demos, and even in high  detail mode it  isn't a slideshow  like "Revertant" for
example, but it isn't soo fun to watch anymore. But therefore you get the latest
swedish definition  of digital art on the  Falcon, a bunch of  great effex, many
light  flares, complex  morphing  env. mapped  vectors, texture mapped  vectors,
melting vectors, lightsources  and much more, accompanied  with real nice grafix
and a surprising outstanding MP2 soundtrack from Cream's coder Candyman...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  8o % - nice ideas, hi-end fx, partly not done so far, but slow!
effex.........  95 % - env. mapped, morphing, transparent, flares, a bit slow!
visuals.......  85 % - cool grafix and logos, well selected textures
musix.........  9o % - the technoing main track falls back behind the 3o3 outtro
design........  9o % - good transitions, timed, well chosen colours
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  88 % - A real cool demo but a hardware killer!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wonder  about the rating  of the  originality, so I just  want to mention
that I rated it a bit down because of the fact that the demo has a damn hardware
hunger.
