TROLL, TROLL? What the hell? No hell, The Raiders Of The Lost Lock have released
their first  intro  on  Falcon and  their first  production  since  1o years  or
something at all. Yes, TROLL is  a group  from the  golden times on  ST and they
disappeared so many years ago and they released only a few things that even I as
ST demo collector didn't even remembered them really.

Matt Us Alem is also known as Kephy nowadays and is responsible  for a very huge
homepage project, the ST Scene Genealogy homepage that  is going to  enlight any
bit on Atari scene history if possible. But why he discovered  the Falcon lately
to do something on it, I really don't  know, but hey, it's  nice to see some new
freax trying to create something at all.

This small  intro was released  as 96 K intro on  the Paracon 3 Party, held last
November by  the Paranoia guys, a  very small  gathering of  Atari sceners  from
several countries and  since there met  some of the  last active bands also some
releases appeared there.

"I'M A TROLL" is a new comer  production of an ST coder and so we will check out
what he did with the Falcon. The intro  starts with noises of a technoing module
composed by 5o5 of CHECKPOINT and  informing  you about  title and  maker of the
demo, but in a bad chosen font, mainly white on... you guess it, black screen.

At next a rendered truecoler  picture, saying PARACON 3 comes up, very colourful
and so really a matter of taste, not really  my one, sorry. This is  followed by
a delayed rotozoomer in red colours, ugh. This looks quite ok, if you ignore the
colors since the delay  effect is  presented in  dithering this time. After that
another screen  pops up, saying "Oldschool?" and "Keep cool!" on upper and lower
border. In the  middle of  the screen there  is a cube  made of 3d dots  turning
around for a while and what I have  to say more that the  ST origin of the coder
breaks through here, esp. with the old black background.

The intro isn't  over yet and brings  us another effect, a fire effect this time
and this  fire is blue, very  strange. And  while it  burns slowly  on the lower
border above it  the words "I'm a troll" are coming up and burning away, in blue
as well. This happens  to times and goes on with the credits, again presented in
that ugly font and last but not least the intro quits clean to the desk.

Final words... This intro doesn't rock, to say the truth. But in comparison with
               other new  comer screens it  shows that  the guy behind knows how
               to code. The effects  aren't state of the art at all and shown on
               ST as well  but at least  he did more  as only a dumb scroller or
               something. The biggest  critics I have  to give to the design and
               pixels. If there  would have been something like design the intro
               could be much  better, but those  old-school-acts aren't state of
               the art anymore  and you can't  call all things  that miss design
               just old school. I for myself have  problems with  rendered logos
               and the ripped font... you know... last but  not least the screen
               doesn't feature any transitions and bad chosen colours. Some high
               light is the music by 5o5 in his known quality.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  1o % - nothing original at all, just a new music
effex.........  25 % - rotozoom, fire, 3d dots... not state of the art
visuals.......  3o % - rendering logo, ripped pixels, no design, bad colz
musix.........  75 % - 5o5 did a good job here
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  35 % - a first release... no breaker at all
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It depends on originality and visuals most since you can always save some points
there. Nobody awaits  breaking effex from  newcomers but  with a  right hand for
the mentioned things you could overplay even the lack of burner effex... Anyway,
nice to see someone new tormenting the old little bird...
