                      GERMAN SCENE REPORT 2K2 PART ONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quarter of the running year has  passed by and  it's time to report the things
going on in the german  Atari scene. The last year was really breaking, but what
brought us the new one?! This  article isn't  thought to  claim the one or other
band as dead, but  just to show  off what happened  and what could happen in the
future... If  you're a  member of  one of  the mentioned  bands, and you want to
correct something, please mail me at: moondog@atari.org

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECKPOINT

This band is, like the most other german bands, just shining through its absence
since over a half year now and... their first release on the GBA demo scene with
a small intro called "We Are Armed" that didn't  matched it in  a competition to
reach the top 2o... The single members seem to work alone on their own stuffs...
A planned release  of the "MONOSTYLE" preview  from the STNICCC 2K was cancelled
again... Since  mOdmate went inactive of  some private reason, the band seems to
stay asleep...

active members on Atari .... 5o5, Defjam
sleeping members atm ....... Joe Cool, mOdmate
state as band .............. sleeping atm.
latest release on Atari .... contribution for DHS Summer Competition 2k1
future ..................... a big demo project, "MONOSTYLE" or "POSH" or so...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREAM

It is damn quiet around that  band since the year  2ooo now. The only active man
is TAO since  long times  now, supporting  several people  with his musix, while
their coder CANDYMAN just made some actions as  mp3 musician and lately as nick-
name-changer, since he calles himself ULTRA since a few weeks.

active members on Atari .... Tao
sleeping members atm ....... Abyss, Ultra, A.-t-
state as band .............. sleeping atm.
latest release on Atari .... another JAM pluggin in April 2ooo
future ..................... maybe we will see their demo "HEFTIG" sometimes?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ESCAPE

As well as their mates from  CHECKPOINT, also ESCAPE disappeared after their two
contributions  for the DHS Summer Competition  that outed  NO as magnificent  ST
coder. As we heard at last, the most  members are stuck  so deep into studies or
their family business that  no further  releases are in  the pipeline. CHARON is
busy in working further on his game project "STUNE" nowadays.

active members on Atari .... Charon
sleeping members atm ....... No, Shifter, Spex, Spion
state as band .............. sleeping atm.
latest release on Atari .... two guestscreens for the DHS Summer Competition
future ..................... they're hiding all their actions!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PARANOIA

Last year they  were one of the most active  german bands, releasing  a bunch of
intros  and demos. And, as  only band, they  announced  a longer  break from any
scene  activities and  they also didn't  announced any new projects for the next
time. Farewell guys and come back quickly...

active members on Atari .... Paranoid?
sleeping members atm ....... Luebke, TNT, Marcstar, Mr. Future
state as band .............. sleeping atm.
latest release on Atari .... "ILLUSIONS" intro, November 2k1
future ..................... nothing more planned in the near future...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NAUGHTY BYTES

As far as I know the last  survivor of that band is  FLASH, who is  the only one
that still uses Atari machines, such as his Falcon and in some way I wonder what
holds him  back by the old .tnb. gang  since he lost  contact to the  most other
(zombie) members like  FXL and LOT or even  DRIZZT. FLASH appears here and there
and my reason to count .tnb. or better  him here, is the fact  that he supported
us  with  a nice  loader picture for  the last  and  also current  issue of UCM.
Furthermore he joined  forces with SAGE (ex ESCAPE) to help  him out with grafix
for his LYNX project "BUNION CANYON". In  my eyes it is  a waste of  talent that
FLASH still hangs on his old band, because he's a hardcore pixeler with a lot of
power (as I could see on his harddisk, grin...) while other bands searching with
sweating hands for artists...

active members on Atari .... Flash
sleeping members atm ....... Drizzt, FXL, Lot
state as band .............. inactive or even dead?!
latest release on Atari .... re-release of TINY TOONS fakedemo in 1999
future ..................... no future at all!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORPORATION

Yeps... we are here as well, but to  learn more about  the movement of our band,
please check the link below that will guide you  to the PRO.PAGANDA article that
reveals all the latest actions and future projects.

>---> .tSCc. PROPAGANDA <---<                                                     {*\PROPAGAN.TXT}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What else?! Yes, that  isn't all  since there  are some people  around  that are
thinking  to dig out their  old Atari's  again, as well  as people who  left the
active 16/32 bit lines but will go to support them in another way, like the guys
of FOUNDATION TWO, who are  organizing the UNCONVENTIONAL PARTY that  is thought
for all systems. There are also some left overs of former bands around, that are
going to  support the nowadays scene in some  way, just like  STRATAGEM, who has
just installed a download mirror for UCM... And so you can  go on, counting some
more people together that aren't really organized in the scene anymore.

Conclusion... The german  ATARI scene of today  is fallen back  a bit behind the
big and glorious actions last year, with the truly great ERROR IN LINE party and
the releases of the  german scene over  the last year  as well, watched over the
thumb  between  15 to 2o  things for ST and  Falcon, starting  from the smallest
intro up to megabyte breaking releases.
At the moment you can get the impression that the scene is a bit out powered esp
since only .tSCc. is releasing  some stuffs  from time to time, while all others
are fallen  into deepest sleep. But after  all I still  would  count the more or
less active core  of the german Atari scene with about 2o people if it will come
hard to hard. And so there is enough  power left to stay  alive some more years,
even if the releases are only dripping out of the spring...

So join our  forces and feed  the hype, feed the scene  with some more releases,
that shows that the Atari scene still has a small home in Germany!
