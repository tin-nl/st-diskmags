Gosh... It seems  as several  dudes recovered their  love for  slideshows on the
Atari scene and I must say that I didn't have too much against slideshows, if...
yeah, if... if they are showing some nice porn or exclusive artworks or at least
some funny things at all... The problem is that this seems  to be my private and
lonely view on  the things, since the most  slideshows  that were lately created
don't show porn, chicks, funny things  or even special artwork... therefore they
are mostly damn boring and over all of a bad quality...

So how are the things with this slideshow, coming the long way from the carpates
from eastern Europe, from Slovakia to  be precise. It is the first ST release by
the band SATANTRONIC that was only 8bit related so far.

As you can see on  the title it is a slideshow  about a special  party, for 8bit
machines only and held  in Slovakia last year. And so you  can imagine what will
be shown here. After a bad downscaled  logo of the party a few  information bits
were shown on black background in a typical 8bit font. Here gives the coder some
hints about the party, the credits and the things to come...

And here they come... it follows a big bunch of photos  taken on that party with
small descriptions  about the things you can see on them. This description  is a
big need here since the photo's are so fucking bad  converted to 16 colours that
it tortures the eyes. I really don't know what tool they have used to create the
conversions but it  seems as tools like  SMURF, SPEED OF LIGHT or GEMVIEW aren't
known in Slovakia... The floyd steinberg  routines must be origins from mars for
them...

The second problem is  the fact that the pictures mostly show very uninteresting
scenes, like empty  rooms, messed rooms, crowded rooms, again and again the same
people in  different scenes that leaves the impression that  only 1o - 15 people
attended. Other  pictures are  underlined with  texts like "Specs at full speed"
but what you see is just a bunch of people in front of something that isn't able
to be identified. The biggest  problem is here that  the pictures don't show any
interesting stuff, the people seem to stay there for photos for their grandma.

Ok, enough mourned around, I just want to mention the other features in here, so
the funky chip  music by MC Laser that is more or less the only highlite of this
production...

Final words... Nothing more to say, not only that I'm not the biggest fan of any
               type of slideshow  except porn  and pixeled  artwork, this one is
               disqualifying itself with the boring pictures and damn, damn ugly
               converted  photos. Hej, that isn't even  8bit style! This prod is
               only for collectors, the rest should  avoid a download because it
               is wasted time and money...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  o5 % - just because of the theme and the original chip music
effex.........  oo % - a fading routine?!
visuals.......  oo % - damn bad converted photos, 1 plane font, kewl! :/
musix.........  7o % - a funky chip music 
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  19 % - delete me, delete me!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe some people  who were on that party will bound some  memories on the pics,
but that should be the only reason to save that slideshow and to hold it back on
a disk... The later SATANTRONIC releases show that they can do a bit more...

.tSCc.  no pr0mises - no demands!                                moondog  o2/2k2
