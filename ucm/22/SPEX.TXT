                        Interview with SPEX of ESCAPE
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ÚUCM  -  Meuh Spex, even if you  told me that you were already interviewed by the
Ú        ALiVE Team I'll go to torment you with another one, for UCM, again.
Ú        I hope that you'll not be bored to death with the following questions...

Spex -  As long as you are not bored with getting the same answers again:-)



ÚUCM  -  What about some  facts at first? Whats your real name, how old  are you,
Ú        where are you coming from and what are you doing in your "real life"?

Spex -  In the otherworld  I'm called Robert Wetzel  and running towards the age
        of 26. My study is  almost at it's end. That means  looking for a job in
        the next future (or beginning just another study? ;-)



ÚUCM  -  What the hell  means "Spex duplex"? A very  strange  nickname. Are there
Ú        deeper meanings?

Spex -  (Knew it... shouldn't  have  used  IRC... ;-)  "Spex" is  a  shortcut of
        "Speculator", which  is  a  latin  word  (milit. [scout , spy]; in  gen.
        [observer,  investigator]).  "Duplex"... it's  a  MUD  related  surname,
        because I once apeared  there with two heads. Since then I kept the name
        while I lost the second head in the meantime.



ÚUCM  -  The UCM readers  know about the  following question. Just tell us  a bit
Ú        from your  computing history. When  do you  started  computing? What was
Ú        your first machine and  what equipment are you using today? What are you
Ú        doing with your machines?

Spex -  I can't  really  remember  at the  first  contact. It  was at a computer
        center of the GDR train... around 1989/90.
        There we  were  told  how  to  use  Turbo Pascal (Version 3.0 *g*) at PC
        clones  (PC 1715  for those  interested, google  for "PC 1715" or have a
        look  at  http://www.robotron-net.de/ (german  page  as  many  of  those
        describing  the PC 1715 :-/ )). After playing at C64s and Amigas (not my
        own :-), I got  a 286 someday. Maybe  you will crush me now, but I never
        rued this descision (which was not taken easily).

        Today I'm using  a PC with GNU/Linux for  working purposes. For gaming I
        have Wintendo and  a Dreamcast. My STF and Falcon are more or less  used
        for watching  and hacking  demos *g*  And there is a Risc PC 600 waiting
        impatiently for being used...



ÚUCM  -  As you  already  told me  you have  some  background  in scene computing
Ú        already, and esp. that it isn't Atari related.
Ú        So please tell  us something about your roots and why did you choose the
Ú        Atari now to create something.

Spex -  Computers are  crying for being programmed... so did my 286, too.  Don't
        ask me for when I've seen my first demo (maybe it wasn't even on PC).
        The demo-virus  was spread on me with all symptoms it brings with it. So
        I tried  myself at  demo coding... I did  some weird  screens and showed
        them  to  my  friends. These  screens  were  never  released  officially
        (fortunately *g*).

        In october 1995 I started to study in Dresden and got lost in Muds. But,
        as you may imagine, I never _played_ a lot, though...

        Creating stuff there was more interesting for me :-)  Caused by problems
        with a guy in the Mud I lost more and more interest in it. Fortunately I
        met Norman and  after being on  the EIL2 there  was only one solution...
        get a grip on an ATARI as fast as possible and start demo coding!



ÚUCM  -  You joined  ESCAPE last  year as  coder. How long do you know Norman and
Ú        maybe the  others and why  do you joined their band? As known your first
Ú        release was a  ST screen  while ESCAPE itself is more Falcon related, so
Ú        maybe Checkpoint  could give you a home as well as ST related demo band.
Ú        What do you think?

Spex -  Hum... to be  honest I met  Defjam years  before I  met Norman the first
        time. But I never really talked with Defjam at this time... Years later,
        maybe 1999 (don't know it really) I had the first contact with Norman.

        After a certain  time I became  a member of Escape. Don't ask me why, it
        simply happened (fate? *g*). I see Escape  as a ATARI-related demo crew,
        which means we are not doing Falcon-only stuff.



ÚUCM  -  Your screen was  fairly nice  for a  newcomer. Did you coded it alone or
Ú        with the help of Norman?

Spex -  I forced Norman to code this! ;-)

        To be real: I did  all the  coding, err, almost. There  are a  couple of
        lines by  Norman. He played  around with  the behaviour  of the  cycling
        while I  was in a  coma like  stasis after  hours  of coding. His  final
        result looked much better than my own routine for this, so I kept it.

        A lot of  help I got  from IntE. It was  a program of him I borrowed the
        idea  of  a 'circling chessboard' from. He  did  also  the  calculations
        necessary to have a real ellipse in the midst of the screen.



ÚUCM  -  Do you have some idols in the scene? Just tell us which coders and demos
Ú        impressed  you most  so far, if  you have  deeper  experiences  in Atari
Ú        demo'ing.

Spex -  I don't have any idols. But there are a lot of people I respect
        (exception: these so called "young multimedia artists" ...)



ÚUCM  -  Do you have  more plans in  making demos on ST, maybe  some bigger stuff
Ú        next time? Or will you explore the depths of the Falcon next?

Spex -  If you treat  this 'Or' as a  mathematical one  you are  probably on the
        right way :-)  So, there  will be  releases for ST and Falcon. Don't ask
        me, when or what, i don't know either :-)



ÚUCM  -  As you told me you  were infected  with the  Atari virus  since EIL 2k1.
Ú        What impressed  you most on  this Party? What  do you thought about the
Ú        Atari scene before meeting all those Atari freaks on EIL 2k1?

Spex -  To be honest, I never had  any contact to  the ATARI scene before that.
        Norman told me about  the EIL 1 and it matched my maginations of a demo
        party. So I attended the EIL 2 ...

        I can't say, what  impressed me most. I think, it was every tiny detail
        up to  the general  feeling... a  lot of  people  from all  over europe
        together, doing so much different and interesting things...



ÚUCM  -  Are you going to  release something on the forthcoming  Mekka/Symposium
Ú        party? Will you go to this event as well or will you ignore it?

Spex -  At this  time I  have  a class  reunion (the  first one  ever *g*). And
        paying 40 Euro for  having  all these "young multimedia artists" around
        me... doesn't sound good neither.



ÚUCM  -  That's it  for the  first part... now comes some UCM special, maybe you
Ú        know about it? It's  called "Brainstorming". I'll  give you  some words
Ú        and you  just have to  write down the first words that  are coming into
Ú        your mind about them... Oki...

A.tari          - f*** interleaved bitplanes, but great machines anyway!

C.hessboards    - havn't played  chess since years. Interestingly they were used
                  in a lot of effects...

D.emocoding     - It's fun and a welcome variety to the things I normally do...

E.scape         - Wrong direction! There is the exit!

F.eske Brothers - Cool guys :-)

H.mmm?          - Hmmm!

I.nternet       - Very useful and partially very unpleasant...

M.egademos      - Creating such one is  rather time  consuming, but if they look
                  great they are worth the effort! (And I love watching them :-)

N.icknames      - Imagine we would not have them...

O.oh Crickey... - Google said it's a demo. Have to watch it!

P.c-Scene       - The old one  in the beginning of the 90es was very good... the
                  actual one... let them do their 'art'...

R.ecords        - You should  record  all your  effect  ideas, so  they wont get
                  lost... probably some lead to new records *g*

S.cene          - Somehow I don't  like this  word. Maybe it has something to do
                  with the PC-Scene? Anyway, I like the ATARI-Scene :-)

W.hip           - (Killing monsters! ;-)  On  some  days this  program  runs for
                  hours and displays the music I hear...



ÚUCM  -  At next another  special feature... just ask yourself a question about a
Ú        topic you always wanted to speak about but you were never asked for.. ;)

Spex -  Hmmm? Hmmm!  (Really i don't know anything to ask myself *g*)



ÚUCM  -  Oki, I think  this is enough  for the first time and be sure, if we will
Ú        see more from you  in the future we will surely find time to squeeze you
Ú        out a bit more... If there are  some things you want to say to the crowd
Ú        you have the possibility to do so now...

Spex -  "Never give up, never surrender!" (taken from Galaxy Quest *g*)



ÚUCM  -  Ok, then  we hope  you will  share much  more time  with  your new Atari
Ú        friends and we hope to see more from you soon! Thanx a lot!
