                           PS2: Rayman - Revolution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The evil robotic pirate Razorbeard has invaded the lands  with his army of robo-
pirates. Taking  the citizens  as prisoners  and slaves, broken  up and spread a
thousand lums across the world and taken the fairy Ly as prisoner! The only hope
is our limbless hero Rayman! With the  help of his  friends he must  free Ly and
the other prisoners to regain his powers and rid the land of the Pirates and the
evil Razorbeard.

This game I also played at IMP13 and I  liked it allot! As Rayman  on the Jaguar
is one of my favourite games of all times I was  very glad to see  what UBI soft
had done when realising our hero in full 3D. It is still the Rayman we know lots
of the game play is still there and works very well in 3D. And  the graphics are
still as lush and cute.

Rayman Revolution is a 3D  platformer. As such  it plays  somewhat as Mario64 or
Crash Bandicoot. The controls  are easy to  get used to most of  all thanks to a
good camera that actually does what  you want most  of the time and  when not is
easy to control. Basically you jump around collect lums and free  familiars from
their cages. And fights a few robots on the way. Your journey goes  by land, air
and in water in quite a few very  different locations  such as  the dark swamps,
the fiery lava temple and the lush hills.
Lots of  what we  love from  the 2D Rayman  is still there  such as the grabable
rings, the purple  bouncy plums and bonus levels is still there and even more is
added. You ride  barrels on legs, play a variety of bonus games but much of what
is added is by the greater game play that 3D can offer. 

The highs are mostly the  same that made  Rayman in 2D on our  Jaguars so great.
The straight game play, the great graphics, and the humour that oozes from every
part of the experience. Usually I am no fan  of 3D games, the industry  has gone
silly with all this 3D in most  cases 2D works and even gives a better game play
and from what I can say  looks better; no 3D  chip in the  world can beat a high
end rendering  program or the  skilfully touch of  a hand pixeled  graphics. But
Rayman Revolution is an exception it works very well in 3D by  the simple design
not overdoing anything and keeping a 2D feel to the game play.  

Sometimes Rayman Revolution crashes! And that feels extremely unfair if you have
just beaten a Boss and yet  haven't had the  opportunity to save  your progress.
Besides from that my only complaint is that it is two short! I finished the game
in pretty much no time. As the story unfolds you shall find four masks the first
two are quite  hard and takes  some time to  get hold of but then it just zipped
past and there I sat watching the end.
