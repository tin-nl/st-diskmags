It seems as it is really hard to come back... After the struggles to release the
first undead  issue, UCM # 21, I thought the  thing is done and I'm some kind of
back in business... But I was damn wrong.

I hadn't the  time to release the following, this, issue in the time I promised,
shame on me. Over months  I didn't a single bit for  this issue, even my Atari's
were collecting dust  in some corner or box. And then, as I started to crawl out
of this  deep hole to start my  works again late in  January 2k2 I was very very
unsatisfied with the things. All the stuff I had done so far was fuckin' old and
outdated. Who is  interested in articles  about the  ERROR IN LINE  today or the
demos that were released on that great party?

On the other hand  I wont throw all  my works into  the trashcan and start again
from scratch, but I  didn't wanted to mix up old stuff and  new articles. So the
conclusion was to  make (another) special part  in the  magazine, containing all
the stuff  from the half year after UCM # 21. So don't wonder about this part of
the magazine, called "OLD BITS AND PIECES".

Some of you might say "Why has this damn sucker  not released a smaller issue of
UCM before  he stopped his work?!" but I have still some ideas about the quality
of UCM, such as  not releasing "slim fast issues" (you remember?). Others  might
say "Baah... if I would collect the stuff for one year I  could stuff my zine as
well, man!" and you're  damn right  and as said, I'm not  satisfied with this as
well. Shit.

Since I  reanimated UCM again I have to struggle  very hard but  I still have in
mind to bring the UCM back to his old  glory. But atm I'm feeling  more like the
Dr. Frankenstein who's building up zombies made of dead bodies, saying everytime
"It lives!". But so far I think it is  possible to  bring it back to life again,
the biggest problem  is the point  that I'm still fighting more or less alone on
the UCM front. I wont fall into  deepest mourning about  bad support and go onto
the nerves  of the readers now, nope, this is a job others  are doing and not my
style. I just want to repeat my words from UCM # 21 again: 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If you really want to see another issue and this in shorter time than this time,
you just have to move your ass and write or do something. We still like any kind
of support. But if you haven't the ass in your pants to do so, you have  to wait
untill I decide that an issue has reached the state to be released...
