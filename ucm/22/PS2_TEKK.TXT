                          PS2: Tekken Tag Tournament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The intro FMV  hints that there  might be  a story somewhere, so  does the small
movies shown when were completing the game  with a character. But  that story is
Hidden for me. Not even the games homepages  gives any hint of  that so I assume
There is none and that it is brute fight only. Fine by me.

I do not  really like  fighting games as  such but I do enjoy  drinking beer and
Playing games with friends and in such occasions fighting games  goes well. So I
Had to buy one fighting game for such  occasions and I had two  choices; the one
With the most blood and gore or the best. So I asked the clerk at the store what
To choose  and he said  Tekken and Tekken  it was. As I am a big  fan of FMVs in
Games I had my treat when I booted up  the game. The intro movie is  beautifully
rendered  and  well  synced  to the sound track  and shows  most  of the in-game
Characters in their  "natural habitat". After the intro I quickly chose played a
Game and was  amazed of how easy the  controls where, you  are not even required
Learn any basics they are obvious! So it is a great beer game!

Well it is about fighting. You  choose two fighters and fight  against two other
Fighters and  the  last one standing  after two  rounds win. So  what is special
About this one then? You fight with  two characters! Not at once, you fight with
One and the  other one is  resting ready  to jump in and  continue. Now the word
Depth seldom fits for fighting games but this gives some depth to the game play,
Even if  you are loosing  you can  have your  fighter resting  in the background
While playing defensive and then jump right in and continue. 

The graphics are great, the  polycount for  the fighters are  enormous the belly
Muscles are not textures they are  polygons! The backgrounds are  just as nicely
Done. The controls are obvious and the game fits perfectly over a beer! There is
Also a  hidden bowling  game (Assessable  after  finishing  the game  with a few
Characters) that is also lots of fun :).

The single player gaming  exprerience is close  to one. Some kind  of story with
some cut scenes  after the fights  to show the  progress and  keep you  fighting
would be nice. As of now you just choose two  fight seven random  games and then
the same boss to view a short little film with one of the  characters you played
with. Most of the times you cant even figure out what the film  is about. I have
a feeling that voices are missing.

- Graphics: 9/1o - Sound: 7/1o - Controls: 9/1o - Fun: 5/1o - Overall: 7.5/1o -
