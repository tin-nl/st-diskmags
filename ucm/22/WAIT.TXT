release.. ERROR IN LINE 2K1 - ñranked 3rd in the Falcon demo competition

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You surely remember all the  stuff around this demo, that was  released now in a
new version, 1.2, and  is running on  4MB machines as well now  after it  wasn't
running even on all 14 MB machines at first...

This demo was  also one of  the most surprising  releases on the ERROR IN LINE 2
competition, since  nobody expected  that  TOYS would release  something, nobody
expected that it would be that big and  nobody expected to see  such great stuff
since TOYS never  made big  steps on the  Falcon at all so far... But the "WAIT"
for this production, announced to be 2 years, was being worthwhile.

I have to admit that it was quite hard to  review the demo since it is that fast
running, giving one screen after another, that I had  to watch it a lot of times
but it can be that I will miss the one or other thing... still.

As the most new  demos, also "WAIT" starts with the usual screen selector and as
always mentioned, my old RGB burned away, was  a victim of the long works on the
last UCM, I checked it on VGA, 1oo Hz. The selector  offers two modes to run the
demo, "normal mode" and "dithered mode". The second one dithers the edges of the
objects and so it gives the impression to run  in a higher resolution, since the
demo  offers, unfortunately, a quite  low resolution in  the most parts. Anyway,
the dithered version looks quite weird then, and I have to say that the "normal"
one looks still, even if it  doesn't hides  the very low resolutions  sometimes,
better... since it looks cleaner.

Anyway, after  chosing your  destination, the  screen turns black and stay black
for a while. Then the first noises  of the soundtrack  coming up, that turns out
to be some kind of technoing dance track, very fast beats and hard use of synths
and stuff as well as several voice samples.

The background of the screen  turns into some moving  and disting  blue texture,
while in  front of it, the first demo  info zooms in in  white letters, that got
mixed up and vanishing from the screen. Furthermore  there appaering vectorised,
in golden colours environment mapped and lightsourced letters on the screen, the
letters W, A, I and T, accompanied with so said voice samples in the soundtrack.
Nice idea! Finally  a small white WAIT  logo comes in, scrolling fast from right
to left  and back, while the blue  texture is still moving in  the background as
well as the golden "W" still moves and turnes around on the screen as well...

As you can see already now, it is  quite difficult to  describe the whole thing,
and it goes on  like this. The credits  coming up, the blue thing in the back is
still here, in front of it a big environment mapped and enlighted  vector object
turns around, while  short credits are  showing up, in partly  transparent white
letters, hell  I can't  write that  fast! And  while  the different  credits are
showing up, other stuffs appearing in  the background, like enlighted 3d bobs or
something. The background  texture looks to be  overlayed sometimes, but changes
again and again...

Some other objects appearing, the background textures  changing, but the technix
going on like this, always  environment mapped stuffs, fast drawn, but always in
a quite low resolution. And so some light spot generator appears, turning around
on the screen  and enlighting  some stuffs  in the surroundings, later on a blue
star or octopussy thingy comes up with loads  of lightspots  on the arms and the
greetings zooming fast away in white  letters. And then an embryo picture by the
frenchy Exocet comes  up, always  accompanied by complex vector objects, held in
quite strange colours.

And then the  most impressive part comes  up, you're zooming into an  underwater
scene, the music  changes and  gives some underwater touch with synth waves too,
and you can  see a bunch of  texturemapped vector fishes  swim around some thing
that has got a lightspot above, enlighting the whole scenery... quite cool!!!

Then the soundtrack goes on harder, some "atari lives" appears on the known blue
background  again, while the  soundtrack  gives the  impression  that a crowd is
cheering up. Quite nice  idea :) And then it  goes on, with a lot of environment
mapping  stuff, going mad on the screen, followed by  another nice idea, showing
another strange picture by  Exocet, while some  silver coloured enlighted vector
stuff is morphing around on the screen and a little white pacman runs from right
to left over the screen... Cool thing, actual!

Then another 3d scene comes up, with four objects standing in a circle on a dark
landscape, while  some lightsources starting  to glow  white on them and another
vector  obejct, looking like  an eye, is  falling into them, getting enlighted a
lot... Damn! Dunno  how to describe  it right! Anyway, this one is followed by a
hand, also texture mapped, that opens up and gives  a lot of lightbobs free that
are slowly flying around on the screen. Nice one!

Then in short all effects are running  through again, the screen turns white and
shows some Atari logo in the background, together with the eye vector, and a big
end scroller in black, giving some more information about the demo... Puhhh...

Final words... What to say?! This demo  is surely a nightmare  for demo testers,
               but a great thing to impress other  peoples since it tries to get
               the connection of newer kind of PC and Amiga demos and finally it
               matches it in some way. Drawbacks are the low resolutions and the
               grafix  and sometimes  used textures, that  are just  a matter of
               taste, some will love  it for sure, but  in my eyes they are much
               too strange coloured. But that are the  only drawbacks, after all
               you  will get a  great firework of  effects that are state of the
               art, accompanied with some  great ideas with  the 3d scenes and a
               good stomping soundtrack. Too  bad for the watcher, that the show
               doesn't lasts  very long, but good  for me, because so I can calm
               down now  and  must not  go on, tormenting  my mind in  trying to
               describe the things I have seen here!

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originality...  9o % - always highend, great 3d scenes, some cool ideas!
effex.........  85 % - a lot of environment mapping, enlighted, morphing...
visuals.......  75 % - the grafix are good, sometime strange colours, textures
musix.........  85 % - rude fast technoing soundtrack with chilling parts, cool!
design........  85 % - several good transitions, much timing
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all in one....  84 % - Another stunning demo, also for standard users!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That demo truly rocks  and if they will  create another one of this kind, I will
love it to "wait" 2 more years then :)  For the  ones who didn't  got it so far,
move your ass and leech it!
