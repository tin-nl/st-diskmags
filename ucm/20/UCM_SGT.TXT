 ò         An Ethernet Board ? Why some people would need it ??
          
    I tried to TelNet MiNT from a PC, and the result is pretty fine : You get a 
MiNT virtual console in a terminal (displayed on the PC screen) I've been able 
to run any kind of MiNT and TOS programs (not the GEM ones) but like for a lot   
of people the EtherNET is missing on Falcon...

    May be possible one day ?? That should be nice to make our own LAN with 
Atari's and PC's (even if we hate those computers :) ), FTP would become a fast 
way for file transfert, and connecting to a cable modem would become reality for 
people who want to use a Falcon !!! Because we all know that TT, and Atari 
Clones such as Hades or Milan can receive a true EtherNET board (ISA or PCI). 
Like i heard on the channel the de600 EtherNET parrallel adapter can do the 
job... but i keep an eye open in case if i find one.... Because it begins really 
Hard to find it nowadays.  

    MiNT blows... So ethernet would make it blow even more on Falcon ! And the 
worth is that we have everything to get it working : SCSI, Cartidge Port, and 
even a LAN port (the LAN port is probably too slow for Ethernet but we have it).
