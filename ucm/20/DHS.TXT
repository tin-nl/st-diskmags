òForeword by STsurvivor :
     
    Evil has organized many online compos over the last years but following the 
low participation to the VLMs conpetition (only 14 votes !!) and the *complete* 
absence of competitors for the compos below he's losing his motivation though he 
always brings us a nice production of his own. Well i'm spreading the compos 
rules than are also available on ódhs.atari.orgð and hope some guys will try to 
"face the challenge to do things..."
ñ-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    

             In time for Christmas, we're having double competitions! 

ó............ Non musican .mod compo third edition!

 Yep, on request this compo re-appears! The goal is to make the best possible 
 module. The rules are: 

             Only NON-musicans can be in the compo, others are disqualified 
             Format of the song must be standard protracker .mod 
             Maximum 4 (four) channels can be used 
             Maximum 720 kb unpacked size (eg, it should fit on a standard dd   
             floppydisk) 
             Each composer are allowed to send in several contributions 

             If you're able to follow these simple rules; go ahead, load 
             Protracker and get started ! 
             Don't be afraid that you're too bad; you'll be in fine company here! :) 


ó............ Christmas intro/demo competition!
             
 This competition is about making the best christmas demo possible. If you 
 choose to  make a technical intro/demo, or something mainly to catch a nice 
 christmas "mood" is up to yourself. As in the end the voters decide who did the 
 best job anyway. The rules are: 

             Intro/demo must work on a simple 1985 Atari ST machine 
             Maximum 1 (one) megabyte ram can be used 
             Intro/demo can be made by several persons 
             STe/TT/Falcon compatibility is a plus, as more people can watch and 
             vote for it 

 Now, that doesn't sound too hard does it? Dress your Atari in red and start 
 coding it!   

             DEADLINE! for both compos IS: 18.00 CET, SUNDAY DECEMBER 5, 1999. 

             Download the rules and deadline reminder.
