The humanity has built a super computer in the arctic ice and now all society 
relies upon it. Would not be so bad if someone had not unleashed viruses upon 
it. Now you must go into the computer in an anti-virus craft and destroy them. 
Think of it like Tron and it wont sound as lame.

You control your craft in a 3D world and shoots with the B button, simple 
controls as it should be. You collect weapon power ups and data pods, once all 
data pods are collected the exit opens and you travel through a tunnel picking 
up more pods for bonus. A simple game to bad that the warp to a level with 
password option is hidden else it would have been fun. 

It is gauroud shaded and polygons all over. I do not like to judge such graphics 
but using the technology they I must say they have done it well. Seems to be 
half frame rate sometimes full.

The music Is techno style (Not Euro-disco smuck!) and I love it. The sound 
effects are computerish and fits the game well.
