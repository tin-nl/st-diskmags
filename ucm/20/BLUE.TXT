                                        òBlueð of the Overlanders, RTSY party 1999
ò===============================================================================ð

ñ64Kð, òFalconð 64K Intro
    This demo displays a large "òBlueð" logo, then there is an 8 directional
    scroller of a fullscreen image with the word "greuh" on it. There's no way
    to quit and it's a bit large for a 64K demo, being a bit over 92K.

ñTKC_IIð, òFalconð 4K Intro
    A small ópinkð rabbit sits in the top left corner, and a rather pixelated
    roto-zoomer fractal is just to the right, which rotates about 4 times and 
    then exits.

ñStarblueð, òSTð 4K Intro
    A very dark horizontal star field is in the background (by dark I mean I 
    didn't even notice it to start with :P). Circling round is the word "òBlueð"
    in dots, as this goes off the screen at the bottom, it leaves "droppings"
    at the top, then the word changes to "demo" and back again.

ñScrexxBallð, òSTð Intro
    A rotating ball scroller, in French :P Errr... Doesn't exit correctly on my
    Falcon.

To round it up, what a waste of time :P

                                                      ñThe Berserkerð of òTeenageð
