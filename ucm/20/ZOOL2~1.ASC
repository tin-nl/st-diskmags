The Nth dimension is under attack and eating sponsored candy saved the world. 
Whoosh around in this fast platform game as the ninja warrior of the Nth 
dimension.

The controls are good but the game itself is still too hard for me. The main 
goal is to eat (Pick up) a set percent of the candy scattered around on the 
level. When you have the exit opens. And after every main world you have a boss.

16 colours, might be more but I can't spot them. The ray-traced intro is really 
lame. Lots of sprites and full frame rate though.

There is no music and just a few sound effects.
