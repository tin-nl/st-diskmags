If you have a Jaguar you know what this is since it came with the main unit.

You steer a ship, shoot and collect pods. The controls are easy. And my little 
sister loves this game (Has all positions on the high score table). I believe 
Atari should have send Raiden in the box instead and the saes might been better.

It is all gauroud shaded and high frame rate. Maybe not too complex objects. 

Main music is great, no in game music. The sound effects are quite good.
