What's happened to all the fairy tales? They're all messed up! Only our brave 
bobcat, Bubsy can protect the worlds kids from these silly stories and tangle-up 
tales. Leap and bound your way through 15 level of platform fun, so says the 
manual.

The game play sucks. The control is slow and feels like swimming in sour cream. 
Bubsy can only stand one hit and then you start over from the beginning. I have 
at three occasions tried to give this game a try and failed. I even let Linda 
try and the yelled at the controls and asked me for Rayman.

The graphics seams to be hand drawn and scanned. Bubsy seems to be an orange 
rabbit with his ears torn off. There is a parallax but that doesn't help much. 
My artistic hearth bleed as I see some ray-traced graphics stand out among the 
rest.

The music is cheerful and might be good but the rest of the game makes me hate 
that as well. The sound effects I hate as well.
