    Time has come to repent for the past mistakes brothers ! Not that this 
article has anything to do with religion :`) Better focus on the stupid things I 
may have written in UCM16

ó    Where is my name in the voters list ?
    
    Erm it took us (Greedo and I) more than 8 hours to compile all the votes and 
count them very carefully. Had I known the folly of it before I  would have been 
sponsored by a painkiller brand !

    Yet the  results are  correct but  maybe I forgot to put  your  name  on the 
voters and I am sincerely sorry for that  esp to òCandymanð who  thoughtfully sent 
me back his votesheet and thought I had lost it :) Dunno if I forgot anyone else 
but please feel free to complain :)


ò    Where is the PHONG mapping in Madness intro ?
    
    Hey I'm not a coder man ! Do I yell at you when  you change the colors of my 
gfx, lose them or truncate them ? Well sure I'm  mad at you ! So ok I got it all 
wrong here : I thought  it was Phong  mapping as I had seen the lightning change 
but I guess I had drunk too  much that night  because when  looking at  it I saw 
that it was really pure mapping... Bing eat dis lamer.

    Another comment on my review of Madness said that I had forgotten to mention 
TAO's name as coder of this cool music  demo. Right again but  hell I've written 
about a dozen of reviews so I have  no time to check  if the credits are correct 
or not and read carefully the credits of Madness and you'll see that Tao is just 
mentioned for the  musical score. The truth is that the replayer was  coded as a 
collaboration between Abyss and Tao...
