If you do not know about Doom then you truly must hate PCs. Anyway it is a first 
person shooter where you see the game from the view of the game hero. Using many 
different weapons you battle your way through demons on your way to hell to stop 
the evil lord (or something). 

If you like me have played it with keyboard or even keyboard/mouse before it 
will be difficult to get used to the pad. Do not give up it is very good 
controls when you have got used to it.

Now I am confused about this; it is 16bit true colour and the sprites and 
textures are well drawn but the resolution! I might be wrong but I guess it is 
160x200 that make the view blurry. At first I also thought it frame rate was low 
but it is actually higher then Alien versus Predator and when playing it does 
not bother.

The music does not exist! The sound effects are great. Nothing more nothing 
less.
