There are a wide variety of games to choose from. Nearly all genres are covered 
and everyone should be able to find something he/she likes. Many titles are 
Jaguar exclusives and a few are conversions from other platforms. Not many 
Jaguar games have made it to other platforms.

Most Jaguar games have bad game controls mostly as a result of bad frame rate. 
Could it be lack of processing power? With 5 parallel CPUs I do not think so. 
The games probably just use the 68000 and the other CPUs idle. Why is that so? 
Maybe Atari should have supplied a better developer platform with C compilers 
for all CPUs or maybe music, polygon and other routines should have been in ROM 
making it easier for developers to use. It is too late to say now.

When it comes to graphics most titles just lack the edge of professionally and 
some just simply stinks. I see that as a proof for ill-funded developer teams. 
If you do not put some money into it you cant get neither money nor quality out 
of it. Do I sense that no one really believed in the Jaguar here not even Atari 
themselves who are responsible for several titles that really stinks.

The sound, what to say about the sound? The answer is probably the same as to 
controls and graphics. I doubt the lack of in game music is because they already 
used all CPU power, they just had inadequate developer tools and no money to 
fund their projects.
