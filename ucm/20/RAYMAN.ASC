Rayman is the reason why I bought a Jaguar. New year 1995/1996 during the trip 
to Aggressive 2 I played this marvellous game on the ferry to Finland and once 
back home I immediately bought a Jaguar and this game.
It is a platformer and a great such.

You control Rayman and while you progress you get new abilities besides jumping 
such as punching, running and flying. The idea is to free all electoons to save 
the world and that is done by punching cages, the real trick is to find and get 
to the cages though. The game is just perfectly hard to play, just as with 
Dungeon master it took me a few years to complete and still I never got 
frustrated (except when people erased my save game).  

True colour, parallax, cute and full frame rate. What more can you ask?

Cute, and fits the game well. Almost perfect.
