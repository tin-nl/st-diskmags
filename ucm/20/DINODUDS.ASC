I do not have the manual, please send it to me. It is a puzzle game so I think I 
would love it if I just knew the controls.

As I do not have the manual I have not even figured out how to complete the 
second level.

The graphics are nice, no technical stuff just plain nice with a parallax.

As I have not played as much I can't tell but I think the music might get 
anoying after a while. The sound effect seems almost non-existance.
