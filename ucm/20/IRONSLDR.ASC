Some really big corporation has taken over the world and controls it with 
40-foot robot soldiers. Now the resistance has stolen one of these "Iron 
soldiers" and it is up to you to control it and bring the evil corporation to it 
knees.

This game lacks action, the IS (Iron Soldier) crawls along and you constantly 
runs out of ammo. It is quite fun to bash down some 10 stories high building for 
a short time but then the lack of action becomes apparent. I hope the sequel is 
more fasts paced then this one.

Mixed flat and texture mapped buildings and enemies. The best part is the 
rotating texture mapped cube when selecting missions.

The music and the sound are above average for this title.
