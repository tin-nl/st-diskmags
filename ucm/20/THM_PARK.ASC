Build your theme park and prosper. Sell it and build another one.

The manual is huge and needed. There are allot of controls and most menu-driven. 
It is sometimes hard to get an overview of your park. You buy new rides, invest 
money in research, decide how much salt to have on the french-fries in short you 
control everything. My girlfriend loves this game, just sit there and tweak it 
all to perfection. Personally I always end up in rage because I can't get those 
damn visitors stay on my lanes. 

The graphics are just ordinary, nothing special. There are ALOT of sprites on 
screen when you get allot of visitors. If it is the number of sprites or not I 
do not know but the game starts to crawl and becomes unplayable if you have to 
many visitors.

The music is cheerful and so are the sound effects, in short they fit the game 
perfectly.
