I am not quite sure about the plot the manual is a carton and all it describes 
are the controls and some bioses. Anyway, it is a tournament fighting game like 
Street fighter and the rest.

The controls stinks, the AI sucks and the fun is not there.

The graphics are hand drawn and scanned, seams cartoonish. I hate them.

Just for this review I listened to the music without seeing the game and I 
believe that they would be good if they was in a good fighting game. As music 
alone it is not good, as game music they might just blend in. The sound effects 
are the usual.
