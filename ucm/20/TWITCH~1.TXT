ò===============================================================================ð

The screen blackens and the words "ñold skoolð" appear, guess what sort of style
this demo's in :) Well that's the loader screen, so whats up next...

The intro containing some wavey scrolly distorting colours, the words:

ò                               Torment Presentð

ò                         At the Pre Millenium Partyð

ò                                a demo calledð

ò                             Twitching Flannelsð
ò       in memory of 'switching channels' the demo we never released....ð

scrolls up the screen, with a pic of a twitching flannel with the last lines.

The loading screen again and on to the next screen. A Large golden Torment logo
sits at the top of the screen with a distorting image overlaid changing colour.
There's a horizontal star field below, and a scoller, which tells you that the
musics in the background is a Mad Max tune.

Next is an infinate sprites screen in full screen using what looks like a 
quarter normal screen sized sprite (a few too many screens there :P). 
The sprite is well drawn and around the face of the creature is a small area
where you get a "glowing" colour fading up and down the screen.

The loader again followed by a pic by ñSpinyð, a close up of a woman's face 
mostly in shadow.

The End. Well the last screen anyway, a classic star field in the background,
with the credits and other info.

From talking to ñSpinyð a bit at the òUK Atari Showð in Stafford I found out that
the demo was kept short so that people wouldn't fall asleep while the voting
took place at òPMPð :) He also told me that the scrolling in first screen was 
probably hardware, but he couldn't remember :)
