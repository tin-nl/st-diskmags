After being shot at and blasted into pieces you wake up in the jungle with no 
memories. Equipped only with your trustworthy gun and a hologram that claims to 
be you. A perfect begins for a good adventure game.

The controls can take a while to get used to as most moves incorporates perfect 
timing. Mostly you wander, run and jump to find objects to use and sometimes you 
shoot a few enemies. After progressed a surten way in the plot you get a 
password to use for continuing to bad that those way points are to sparse, it 
really get annoying starting over knowing you have 18 tasks to do just because 
of a miss jump.

The graphics are okay but nothing more. The vector animations (Which you cant 
stop) are jerky and far off from the wow feeling I got from the prequel Another 
world. Backgrounds lack details.

The music is not good nor bad they are in the realms of okay. The sound effects 
are to few and stand out too much.
