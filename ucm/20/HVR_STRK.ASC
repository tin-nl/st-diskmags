The evil aliens plot again. This time you as a lone soldier (as usual) must 
infiltrate and destroy the alien home world with a hovercraft.

The controls as far as buttons are easy but then there is the fact that it is a 
hover craft without any friction to the ground and the low frame rate. I had a 
period when I liked this game, I liked it allot but I cant find that mood again. 
Now I just get frustrated about the low frame rate.

It us gauroud shaded texture mapped polygon game. Half screen status panel and 
still way bellow 10 fps. Virtually impossible to play without allot of patience. 
As screenshot it looks great though.

The music is very good and so are the sound effects.
