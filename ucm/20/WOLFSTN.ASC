You are a commando soldier on the front of World War 2 and your mission is to 
kill Hitler on the way you wade through German blood. A conversion of the 
classic PC title that started it all. If there had been no Wolfenstein Doom nor 
Quake would ever been.

The original PC game played with keyboard and that is what I am used to. Playing 
with pad do not come easy. I would like to have the save game feature remember 
your position and killed enemies as well. Besides that it is a simple game to 
play. Lean back and kill a few Nazis. 

The frame rate is high and the rest is just like on the PC. Texture mapped walls 
and sprite enemies all fully lit. I would like to see some depth queue of the 
light. 

There is an intro song and a hidden song select menu but no in game music which 
makes the game feel empty. The sound effect are the well know "main leben!" and 
not much else, the sound effects leaves the game empty as well.
