The gatekeeper in the spectre zone once in a while puts of a fight for life or 
death literally for his amusement. Eight men/women fighting for a precious 
price: a new life and a chance to do better. If you ask me this is the best 
story for any fighting game. 

The game is 100% 3D and so is the game play no cheating just drawing a 2D game 
in 3D. The controls are simple A tries to avoid an attack, B kicks and C 
punches. Do combinations and you get special moves and of course you can jump 
and duck as usual. There is just one drawback in game play; it is too easy. I 
usually suck at fighting games and after only three days I had completed the 
game. So if you want it to last you must have allot of friends to play with or 
be a worse player then me.

What can I say, fully texture mapped 600+ polygon characters and smooth frame 
rate (Not full)? 

There is allot of different songs for the sound track and they all are good, I 
especially like the intro song with the "fight for life" sample totally synced 
to the in game scenes. The sound effects are quite ordinary but ok.
