A nice picture of some kid playing in the water. But if you take a closer look,
this surely is an impression of a maniac who tries to hide something from the
photographer's eye. What is his secret? I think it has something to do with the
bottle he quickly tries to push underneath the water. Then what can there be 
inside the bottle? Lemonade? Not likely, considering the fact the little boy is 
TiNKer of Teenage. 

The previous paragraph illustrates the world of tomorrow. Confronting children 
with alcohol at early age creates beast. Monsterous appearances who devote their
lives on spreading fear and anger. Even in our humble Atariscene, we are not
seldom confronted with these psychopaths. The megatons of Swedish beerdrinkers,
the fearsome Germans, the Grolschy Dutch.

The influence they have on others is massive. They tend to project their illness
on the weak. I can remember this conversation on channel #atariscne:

[tiNKer]  - Hello Candyman_, want a beer?
Candyman_ - Huj tinker... hmm.. it's only 12:30, and I'm at work...
[tiNKer]  - Candy, chicken!
Candyman_ - tinker, oh well... alright.

I really wonder if there is a solution for this massive social problem. Shutting
down all breweries is not an option, as this would lead to civil disorder and,
eventually, revolution. Eventhough money makes the world go round, alcohol makes
it appealing. For some.
