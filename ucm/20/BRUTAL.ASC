It is in the future and the sport fans demands more blood and thus football and 
medieval warfare is combined and Brutal Sports Football is born. You control a 
team of seven genetically engineered Vikings, Lizards, Goats or Rhinos on the 
field. You score by making goals and decapitating the opposite team. To add to 
the fun samurai swords, axes, grenades and more is scattered around the field. 
Lots of blood and lots of fun. I would say this is a SteelBall rip-off with an 
edge.  

There are several game modes among those I prefer League and Unfriendly. In 
league you choose a team and make your way up the ranks, earning money and 
taking care of your players. What I like more is unfriendly; two teams play best 
of one, three or seven games. Good against computer, great against a friend.
There are several ways to control your team but the basics are A uses picked up 
objects, B passes/punches and C shoots/catches. Simple and useful. 

The graphics are good. They give the game a feel of both humour and brutality. 
Seems like bitmap brother graphics actually in some parts. Not taking the ball, 
judge, decapitated heads, projectiles in account there is at least 14 sprites 
probably allot more.

The music is great and realy fits into the game. It is the music that clearly 
states to the player that this is violence for entertainment. The sound effects 
are there and I guess they are good as I have nothing to say about them really.
