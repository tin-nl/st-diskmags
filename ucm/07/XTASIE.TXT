Hum... The last demo I've  seen from  this guys was their  contribution for the
Place 2 Be Again 1994. Up to now was radio-silence, apart from  their Doom 030-
project.
Now they are  back with  a very strange demo. This one doesn't run correctly on
my TV-set. The colors are only blue  and the screen is very blurred. Only on my
VGA-monitor I can take a look at the demo without destroying my eyes... I don't
know why...
Ok, the demo starts  with a Windows 95 bootup-screen... What?! Oh, it's Windows
95 plus... A techno-music  starts to play and several raytraced logos appearing
on the screen.
The first effect is  a gouraud-shaded  cube with other  raytraced things in the
background. Only one simple object was shown... Arf... it's boring.
At next  a good old  starfield comes  up, followed by a  marble-tecture-tunnel,
which looks quiet nice. After  another boring effect, fire again (yawn) follows
a textured-cube with Dragonball (a manga-comic) pictures on the sides. Ooold...
A simple  rotozoom tells  the greetings  and the best  effect in the whole demo
comes up, interpolated  texture-mapping. More of  this and the  demo would be a
bit more entertaining.
The last thing is a Fli-animation (nice) and the credits. Now the usual Windows
95 fake comes back to the turn off report.
What should I say? This demo is only boring. Up to  one effect you have all the
other things seen before for thousand times and sometimes also much better. The
rendered pictures  and the  music  are also  only mediocre. This  demo could be
released in  1994 or so because it looks  very oldfashioned to me... Ok, it's a
comeback but the only thing I can say: get it, look at it, delete it...
