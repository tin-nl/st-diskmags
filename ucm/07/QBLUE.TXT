Hu, this is another game from the Omikron-man. Yes, you're right. This  game is
coded in Omikron Basic (as  always by  this autor) and  so  you it's nearly  of
course that the game is shit...
But I'll tell you at first something about the game itself. You're driving with
a futuristic vehicle over the earth to collect some  radioactive bullets and if
you've all collected you can leave the  contaminated planet. But you  must be a
bit careful because  the terrain is  sometimes not passable (swamp)... Ok, that
was all for this...
After starting the game the  program asks if you've adjust the right resolution
(Truecolor in 320*240 pixels). It's  totally  incomprehensible for  me that the
programmer can't include  a resolution-change in  the program itself... But ok,
I changed the resolution and started the game.
At first a  rendered (Wow ;-) ...) intro-picture appears  on the screen. Should
the programmer have increased the standard of his games?!
The informations  to the game coming up, with a nice texture in the background.
After  the "options"-screen and  a little, also  rendered picture of my vehicle
the game starts with the message "Do you know what 'old fashioned' means?"...
Erm, what's this?! And then I saw what the programmer means! Very simple block-
grafix with ca. 16 colors!!! Oh boy! In the middle  of the playfield a rendered
earth-globe is turning around but the rest looks like shit! Argl!
The gameplay isn't to tough like in the other  games by this programmer but the
only thing I was searching for was the reset-button!
Besides the cruel grafix  there isn't a  soundtrack or even FX. The only noises
are some bleeps made of the soundchip.
The  control of your vehicle  is also  very  useless. On VGA you can't play the
game because your  vehicle ist to  fast and so you're sticking everytime in the
swamp or so...
Fuck off! For such a  shitty game the programmer will have 20 DM?! It's only an
impudence I think... Hey! Just  take another programming-language! At least the
good old GFA-basic! It's not good for your image to make tons of programs which
are sometimes also a bit good looking when no one can play them! I'm interested
to know  how many  users are registered  for your games... Take a look at games
like IMPULSE, PACTHEM or SKYFALL and think about my words!
Make a big bow  around the games of this guy! Save your money to get some other
stuff which is worth buying...
