Hum... Sometimes  I had thought: What a great music!  I had drawn  parallels to
the Beatles. A great impressive guitar-sound... finest Brit-Pop. But then, as I
have heard about the slagging-wars with other bands like Pulp or Supergrass and
I have heard of the  total arrogance of the band (We're the best!) I've changed
my mind. Ok, they're making  great music and  to their concerts are coming many
many peoples (for one  concert in  the UK about  4 mio peoples want to have the
tickets...) but it is the absolutely last when a band breaks up a concert after
only 2 played  songs... I can't  understand  that also  after such  a dull idea
again masses of guys running to their concerts...
Ok, I had  bought this  album and for  some weeks the band was state of the art
for me but now  I don't know what I sould  think about  them. Only one thing is
save: I wouldn't buy  any album  from them in the future. I think a band, which
doesn't care  about their  fans must be  ignored. This is the only way  to show
them that they're nothing without their fans.
Because of this I wouldn't write more about them here...
