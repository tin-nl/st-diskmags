    DE/VISION - "UNVERSED IN LOVE"
  ----------------------------------{*f0

released by : Indigo / Strange Ways Records 1995
price       : about 34 DeutschMark

This is  the predecessor-album  of "FAIRYTALE?" and  again you  can  hear GREAT
synthie-pop-songs! I had bought this album after I've heard the newest album.
Hum... This band seems  to be genious! Even if the songs on this work are a bit
slower and sometimes  sounding a  bit depressive  its again a  milestone in the
synthpop-zone... I don't no why I like this so much.
Ok, on this album are the following songs:

01. Free From Cares
02. Soul-Keeper
03. At Night
04. Dress Me When I Bleed
05. Like A Sea Of Flames
06. Skip This Page
07. Love Me Again
08. Moments We Shared
09. Blue Moon
10. Time

As I have telled above the songs are all very slow played, its more to lay back
in the armchair and  hear on as to  dance for... If you like calm synthie-music
you should go by all means to the next record-shop and at least test this piece
of great  music... Then hear to  the following songs (my favourites): "Dress Me
When I Bleed", "Like A Sea Of Flames", "Moments We Shared" and "Blue Moon"...
Of course are all the other songs as well very worth to be heared.
Ok, I'll go over to the songtexts...

FREE FROM CARES
---------------

Improbity
In each word we say
Mendacity
We pretend to pray.

Perfidious
The words of Jesus
And anytime
We end up smashed to pieces.

Ingratitude
In a world of lies
We are free from cares
We close our eyes.

I assume
There is no healer
To heal this world
To make us cleaner.

I assume...

Free from cares.

Hypocrisy
We show each day
Leads into darkness
We go insane.

Understandably
We are of no account
We jeer the creatures
That we once found.

It's tenderness
We are living on
So it's no wonder
That we're all gone.

SOUL-KEEPER
-----------

Tell me what I like
The certain things I had to hide
I never dared to tell
This is what I like
Now I have overcome my fright
I couldn't stand its smell.

You promise me delight
Your flesh becomes my bribe
A gift I can't resist
I have to run the risk
Your innocence and pride
The sweetest I could find
Deceive me with your kiss
Betray my fading lips.

Take me by the hand
Escape with me into your land
Of neverending lust
Minds and bodies melt
You know your game has reached the end
My everlasting trust.

You promise me delight...

You promised me delight
Now hurt me day and night
A gift I gladly keep
To fool another cheat
You kiss my face good bye
And leave me with a smile
You lead me into deep
Another soul to keep.

AT NIGHT
--------

It's easy on the eye
When the truth turns into lies
Don't protect yourself from shame
"I am not the one to blame"
Feel the pain they hold inside
See the grief behind their pride
Still their love won't ever die
And tonight it feels alright.

You don't understand
My back against the wall
I ever seem to fall
You don't understand
You don't understand
I never hear you call
I was made for falling down.

The moon relieves against the sky
Shapeless faces pass me by
I hate to see the part I play
But at night all cats are grey
Get undressed and hold me tight
When the dark defeats the light
Then my love may even die
But at night I feel alright.

You don't understand...

The things that made me fall
The things that might say
I never hear you call
I never feel again.

DRESS ME WHEN I BLEED

I realy try my best
To give you
Whatever you demand
I'm your friend
I'll pass your test
I really try my best
To treat you
Not like anyone
But much better
Than the rest.

You give me what I need
You dress when I bleed
You cheer me when I'm blue
I feel your love is true.

I'll never give away
Your sweet heart
That's beating in your chest
You do me good
Whatever you say
I'll never turn away
From you
The yearning inside gets worse
And it grows
Day by day.

Your give me what I need...

LIKE A SEA OF FLAMES
--------------------

Protect me from this boring life
Diversify my days
Into your sea I want to dive
When I fall ill with haze
Too many faults that you will find
You've got to bear them all
Relieve me from my haughty kind
Pride goes before a fall.

Don't pronounce me guilty when I lie
Be merciful to me
Have patience with me when I cry
For your charity
Be near me when I need you most
Tranquilize my soul
Delight me like a blooming rose
Then I'll reach my goal.

Like a sea of flames
Like a sea of flames
Like a sea of flames
You warm me, day by day.

You turn down the coldest cold
You're like a sea of flames
You give me shelter till I'm old
And you keep me from shame
You will be the guding light
When I lose my way
You will lead me through the night
And also through the day.

Like a sea of flames...

SKIP THIS PAGE
--------------

You lead me through the harshest pain
Though I injure you
And you forgive me that I'm so mean
It's not hard for you
To be gentle with your heart and soul
That is what I try
Expell me if you don't believe
But don't start to cry.

I beg you
Lay down by my side
To feel you
You build up my pride
And I swear
I will be bound
That I care 'leave you safe and sound.

There are times we disagree
And we start to hate
But in the end we harmonize
We hang on to each blade
Forget the things I say to you
When I'm in a rage
Don't listen to the row I make
You'd better skip this page.

I beg you...

LOVE ME AGAIN
-------------

You wouldn't believe what I'm going through
My thoughts and emotions lay bare for you
Try not to hurt them, don't blow out the flame
Just be gentle and hold me again
We cannot take back all the words we said
But try to hold on to the moments we shared
Don't deceive me but release me from pain
Please be gentle and kiss me, kiss me again.

People regret when they bleed
After a long way we meet
If you have faith you can see
The beauty inside of me.

Life is so cold in the still of the night
Longing for your temple of delight
Don't abuse me but seduce me today
Please be gentle and love me, love me again.

People regret when they bleed
never despise what you need
If you believe we can be
All that we wanted to be.

people regret when they bleed
After a long way we meet
If you have faith you can see
The beauty inside of me.

MOMENTS WE SHARED
-----------------

Don't come back
You take my breath
Long before I die
I came to see you again
You make me pray
For being in love with you tonight.

In every moment we have shared
You withheld all what I deserved
And left me with my pain.
For every moment we have shared
You take away what I deserve
And leave me in despair.

Long before I die...

In every moment we have shared...

BLUE MOON
---------

Stories of the past
Make my heart ache
The shining of the stars
Will make the earth quake
Gone too far
The angels start to sing
DAS ENDE IST NAH
And pain is what it brings.

I found heaven
I found joy
And peace within my mind
In the sand, in the grass
In the hills of the land called Blue moon
I found heaven.

I heard it in a dream
Don't sell your soul
Now there's a need to scream
A need to change my role
'Cause stories of the past
Make my heart ache
Time goes too fast
For my sake.

I found heaven...

TIME
----

Time... time changes everything
Time heals all your wounds
A broken heart will heal.

Time... time chnages every thought
Time chnages eery point of view
You will see things in a different light.

Fears... will be forgotten soon
Will be forgotten totally
Your mind will be cleaned up.

You will see the sun again
You will feel its warmth again
Smiling people in the crowd
Talking to you, hear their sound.

Time... time changes everyone
Time changes even friend and foe
You will see them from a different side.

Tears... will seep away real soon
Will wash away your misery
Your sigh will fade away.

Yep... That's it.
