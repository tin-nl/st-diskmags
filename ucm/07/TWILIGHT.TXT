    WELCOME TO THE TWILIGHT-ZONE...
 -------------------------------------{*f0

In this article I'll review  the funniest  modules for the screensaver TWILIGHT
by Delirium Arts / Germany.
You all surely knew the effects  which modern  screensavers bring to  your your
screen. There are melt-down-effex, several vector-lines, puzzles and much more.
These effex are nice the  first time, the second time you'll smile for a second
and then you're bored of them...
But TWILIGHT brings other effex to your screen...

...sorry... Because TWILIGHT was broken down 2 times while testing it and I had
written  the article  besides  testing (-> the complete system was  broken down
besides writing -> not  saved the article...) my  motivation  was flown away to
write this article again. But I will test it sometimes  again and bring you the
article perhaps in the Xmas-issue of UNDERCOVER.
