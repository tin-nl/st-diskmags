KWIKS is an remake of an old 8-bit-game, called QUIX, original, isn't it?
You have surely played this game before on  another computer  or you have heard
of it before. If not, I'll tell you fastly something about the game...
You have  to fill an  area on your screen by control a dot  over the screen. On
the screen are flying some dots around  which you  shouldn't contact  with your
dot or the line which your dot  has made. Only if  you reach  the border of the
area you will be not killed. If you have 75 % or more of the screen  filled you
will go to the next level. Ok, an  easy game  you'll think  but if  more than 5
dots are moving around on the screen it will be a bit trickier, you'll see...
The game itself is good  presented for a  PD-game. Ok, the effex and  grafix in
the intro aren't state of the art but the fire-effect in the game-over-sequence
is well  done... The grafix in the  game are  only some  digitized  landscapes,
nothing more. The sound  isn't bad, there are different  modules for the single
screens and they're nice to hear on.
The  control over your  dot is also very simple and the  highscore is saveable,
what do you want more?
Ok, the game-princip is a bit old but good enough for playing some minutes...
If you have a bit space left on your harddisk you can get the  game if you like
such little simple things...
