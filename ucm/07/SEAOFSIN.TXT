      SEA OF SIN - "WATCH OUT!"
   -------------------------------{*f0

released by : Subtronic Records 1995
price       : 30 DeutschMark

After the first song you hear that SEA OF SIN following Depeche Mode's example!
It sounds also  very similar to Camouflage and the newer work  of Front 242 but
it is much more melodious and not so brutal like F242.
It's total uncomplicated synthie-pop... And if you like this  kind of music you
will like  SEA OF SIN. I must mention that  they  aren't so soft like De/Vision
and so you should take a "ear" to this album at your music-shop but if you have
liked Camouflage  you'll like Sea Of Sin, even if this album is a little bit to
monotonous...
Ok, I haven't nothing  more to tell  about the album itself and so lets go over
to the contents...

01. Last Day In Paradise
02. Afterworld
03. Hoffnung
04. Truth
05. I Live My Life
06. She Doesn't Care
07. Ride The Sky
08. Deep Inside
09. Closer To Sin
10. Sudden Death
11. Hold On To Your Dreams
12. Heartbeat Of Nature
13. Beyond Sadness
14. Lonesome Scenery
15. Mechanical Domination

The songs be about the life, the nature and the ways of the people. They aren't
very fast  played and more  to hear on  as to dance after it. The best songs in
my opinion, in  text and  music  are: "Ride The Sky", "Heartbeat Of Nature" and
"Beyond Sadness". The  other  songs aren't bad  but sometimes  the voice of the
singer don't matches to  the songs, it's too deep and dark, but  some guys will
surely like this...
Ok, before  you're running  to the next music-shop  you can read the song-texts
here...

LAST DAY IN PARADISE
--------------------

Can't ignore all these compromises
In your eyes
Try to explore what's so hypnotizing
In your smile.

When I see you standing in the light
I feel affection for your pretty sight
Only when we start to hold us tight
My heart perceives that certain kind of fright.

So tell me why
Your try now to deny
The fact that all your feelings were terrible lies
All we got
Seems like another plot
Therefore we spent our last day in paradise.

Can't ignore all these compromises
In your eyes
Try to explore what's so hypnotizing
In your smile.

Never sure about this anxious pain
You stare at me now when I call your name
Never sure if you deserve my shame
I`ve lost my words that's why I can't explain.

So tell me why
Your try now to deny
The fact that all your feelings were terrible lies
All we got
Seems like another plot
Therefore we spent our last day in paradise.

When I look into your eyes
I don't want to realize
That our love has gone away
I'd wish to have another day
Like a stranger by my side
You disappear into the night
Inner strength and honest pride
There's nothing left but misery in this night.

So tell me why...

AFTERWORLD
----------

Late at night
When everybody seemed to be save till the morning
One foolish mind
Decided to destroy the whole world without warning.

Now it's too late for any advice
The mushroom cluds have covered the skies
The sands of life  are ceasing to run
Cause afterworld just now has begun.

Can't you see
That politicians try to conceal with appeasements
They'll have to rule
Not only with allowances but achievements.

Now it's too late for any advice
The mushroom cluds have covered the skies
The sands of life  are ceasing to run
Cause afterworld just now has begun.

Finally
The only thing that's left is a vast devastation
You can't deny
That we will never have a chance of recreation.

Now it's too late...

TRUTH
-----

Truth has torn us apart
And your clear demand
Seems as cruel as violence
Truth enlightened the dark
When the homeless child
Wants to fly away for a while
With a smile
Of inner silence.

Inbetween your freezing cold
My only hope runs up to nowhere
Far away from the source of life
Since betrayal has rottened your smile.

Truth has torn us apart
And your clear demand
Seems as cruel as violence
Truth enlightened the dark
When the homeless child
Wants to fly away for a while
With a smile
Of inner silence.

Exposed to your affected charm
I hate the way you stand beside me
Reality reveals the harm
Since betrayal has rottened your smile.

Truth has torn us apart
And your clear demand
Seems as cruel as violence
Truth enlightened the dark
When the homeless child
Wants to fly away for a while
With a smile
Of inner silence.

You don't care when the homeless boy
Does refuse your joy
In this strangest silence
You donžt care for forgotten times
Since betrayal has rottened your smile.

Truth has torn...

I LIVE MY LIFE
--------------

Every day
My life is almost the same
I can't find a way
Out of this pain
All the time
I see the winners
And all behind
The way they use to laugh.

I go away
And hope that you will agree
I cannot stay
And please that you follow me
I hate that kind
Of sacrificing decay
And in the end
I'm sure you wouldn't bear.

I live my life
Beyond the things I should do
I live my life
To lose the distance from you
I live my life
Withing this permanent due
I life my life
Until the end of my days.

Lots of frown
Increase the passion in me
I'm feeling down
Instead of feeling free
I lose myself
In ordinary details
And I regret
My ruling jealousy.

I live my life
Complications
I live my life
Chase me everywhere
I live my life
Set my endless agony
Until the end of my days.

I live my life...

SHE DOESN'T CARE
----------------

Somewhere in a street cafe next to the door
You can see this fragile creature on the floor
With certain smile she enters unknown land
In her hand she holds the needle she can't stand.

She doesn't care
For the things around
She doesn't dare
To return to the ground
Searching a way
To escape all the chains
She can't resist
To the drug in her vains.

Suddenly her eyes are gleaming like the sun
One more time her weary dreamworld has begun
These intoxicating moments
Cause to fly
But I'm sure one day she'll crash down
She will die.

She doesn't care...

RIDE THE SKY
------------

We were caught in our illusions
We never got enough
Among these faceless people
We seemed so cool and though.

We searched for satisfaction
The end was out of sight
We all were so unfailing
No reason for a flight.

In these holy days of absolution
We're riding through the skies for another night
Since these holy days of our conclusion
We're riding through the skies for another night
Side by side
Our ancient fear
Will turn now intro real pride.

Confusion did surround us
We tried to make it clear
We were so overbearing
But felt that kind of fear.

Surpassing all the others
And trying to maintain
Our selfdenial lifestyle
Was our highest aim.

In these holy days of absolution
We're riding through the skies for another night
Since these holy days of our conclusion
We're riding through the skies for another night
Side by side
Our ancient fear
Will turn now intro real pride.

Playing down offences
The element of crime
We paid the highest prices
To have a whale of time.

If you wanna change it
You'll have to break away
You have to live your own life
Throughout and every day.

In these days...

DEEP INSIDE
-----------

When I lie in your arms again
You can't see the stranger by my side
When I follow your charm again
I ignore the yearning deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside.

When I lie in your arms again
You can't find the answers in my lies
When I follow your charm again
I try hide the teardrops in my eyes.

Dazing delight
When the yearning burns deep inside
Dazing delight
When the yearning burns deep inside.

I despite the purpose
Deep inside
As I condemn our hopeless fall
Deep inside
Cause underneath the surface
Deep inside
There's even less than nothing at all.

When I lie in your arms again
You can't feel the tortures in my mind
When I follow your charm again
I deny my anguish in disguise.

Dazing delight...

I despise...

Dazing delight...

CLOSER TO SIN
-------------

Endless nights
Together in love
The moon is rising
Shining above
Rainy days
Your hands on my skin
The air is burning
We're closer to sin.

Cause longing for you
Makes me feel now so blue
Since the day we met
I could never forget
All these feelings inside of me.

Waking up
I'm starting to see
The time with you
Was just fantasy
All the things
You wanted to say
And all the games
We omitted to play.

Cause longing for you
Makes me feel now so blue
Since the day we met
I could never forget
All these feelings inside of me.

After all
That happend to me
I had to doubt
Reality
One more night
Alone in the street
This hopeless cold
Just leaves me to bleed.

Cause longing...

SUDDEN DEATH
------------

When I got his message
I nearly couldn't believe
He wrote down the passage
That he decided to leave.

Staring at these letters
I don't know what to do
This unexpected matter
Hits like a bold from the blue
Can't beleive that it's true.

Sudden death took away his breath of life
his minde got out of control in this night
Sudden death took away his breath of life
he saw no other way out than suicide.

Staring at these pictures
i feel as if I break
Depressions overwhelm me
That's why it's harder to take
When those feelings awake.

Sudden death took away his breath of life
his minde got out of control in this night
Sudden death took away his breath of life
he saw no other way out than suicide.

Senseless days of reservation
Followed by his cruel revelation
His silence broke him intro pieces
The stronger he seemed
The worse he did feel deep inside.

We try to respect his conclusion
Even if it was no solution
Tangled by his false emotions
We didn't remark
That he was so fragile inside.

Searching for the answers
It hurts me to proclaim
We were so unsuspecting
While he did finish his pain
Full of troubles again.

Sudden death...

HOLD ON TO YOUR DREAMS
----------------------

Caught
In a life full of misery
Trying to flee
Unable to see.

Lost
In this cruel reality
Searching a way
To leave all this grey.

Dreams
Are all the hopes that keep alive
They give us reason to survive
And there's a lot we have to do
Till all these dreams come true
They are the roots of fantasy
They show us how we want to be
And there's a lot we have to do
Till all these dreams come true.

Left
To a terrible destiny
Hoping to find
The answers behind.

Screams
For some more humanity
Wishing to get
Affection once had.

Dreams
Are all the hopes that keep alive
They give us reason to survive
And there's a lot we have to do
Till all these dreams come true
They are the roots of fantasy
They show us how we want to be
And there's a lot we have to do
Till all these dreams come true.

Till all these dreams come true.

HEARTBEAT OF NATURE
-------------------

No matter who you are
We have to share a threatening destiny
Cause in this selfish world
There is no chance to save a life
Without nature.

No matter near or far
We can't  deny the endless fall we see
And so we have to learn
There is a need to change our minds
Whatever people may say.

Hopeless grey now covers the sky
The birds have ceased to sing and fly
Pollution of the rivers and seas
Forests are full of dying trees
The air is thick and takes our breath
We all are guilty of natures death
Change your mind.

No matter who...

BEYOND SADNESS
--------------

He used to be
A little boy
Five years old
And full of joy
All the time
He felt that life's worth living here
So undemanding.

The years passed by
While he grew up
His life got grey
And full of blood
He couldn't find
The sense he once was living for
He faded more and more.

When I saw his genuine smiling
I forgot the urge around him
he enjoyed his holy world of fantasy
Ignoring how to be.

When I saw his genuine smiling
I forgot the urge around him
he enjoyed his holy world of fantasy
He felt so pure and free.

Try now so soothe the other
Use your brain and think it over
There are even little things
That give your live another kind of sense.

Try now to keep your pleasure
Wealth is not the only measure
There are even little things
That give your live another kind of sense.

When I saw...

In these days of sanity
He lost the aim he used to be
Since his world got broken
Full of dreams unspoken
His inner sadness defeated
The joy he once had.

When I saw...

He felt so pure and free.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

LONESOME SCENERY
----------------

When the streets are empty after midnight
Mist is rising in the gloomy light
No onewalks through the lonely darkness
The fear is stronger than the holy pride.

Try to flee from this awful danger
In the end you could only die
So beware and escort the stranger
Cause he's the one who would never lie.

So try to believe me
Please conceive me
never engage your vanity
Try to believe me
please conceive me
You'd better change your tendencies.

One more time you ignore advices
Even though you can feel the greed
So you're left to your own devices
You have to run or you have to beat
You have to run or you have to bleed.

So try to blieve me...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And at last another "HI!" to Evi...
