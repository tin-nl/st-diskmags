I know, this game was tested in many other diskmags before but sometimes I mean
the reviewer were a bit to  enthusiastic about  this game and so I have decided
to review it also here...
Ok, SUPER STARIO LAND is  the SUPER MARIO  conversion for  the ST, but it isn't
the first conversion of this  game... Before many years there was a game called
THE GREAT GIANA-SISTERS... It was a superb game and much better as the original
on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)...
Now there is a new one, this one. I think you  know what you have to do in this
game, when not here comes a little description of the game. You have to run and
jump around with your heroe in a comic-world and you have to collect some gold-
pieces. You must  finish the  levels in a  time-limit  and  fight against  some
enemies. For this you  can jump them on the head or shot them when you have the
ability. You can that is  to say collect several extras and so your hereo grows
up and can  shot... If you will touch  an enemie you'll lost your extras before
you die  and so you're  longer alive with the  collected extras... Your enemies
are little exploding tortures, frogs, birds and worms.
Thats it. Nothing more  to say. Its only a game for children which don't bother
themselves on the niggardly design of the game...
So we come to the technic... The grafix are, besides the intro-grafix very, erm
poor. Only very  few colourless  sprites  are running  around on the screen. It
looks like a C-64-game  or a original  Spectrum-conversion. Bleurgh... Remember
games like  ZOOL, FIRE & ICE or PARASOL STARS, there  were masses of colours on
the screen... but here? Nearly a monochrome nightmare...
Then the sound. In the "intro" you have a tracker-sound, even on the ST. But in
the  game itself you can  only select  very crude and  sparse effex made of the
soundchip like bleep and klong or a chip-musix, nothing more and also not mixed
and this is a shame... (therfore the scrolling runs in one frame!!! /drizzt)
The control  is ok and  this is one plus-point. There are also many levels, the
screen scrolls soft and also a highscore is included so it is at least playable
and the motivation is a bit saved...
All in one  this game fills a little bit  the very big hole in the games-market
on the ST but it reaches not  the quality of budget-games of former years (like
the Dizzy-series or Dynamo...)
There are  some sequels  planned like  SPACE ACE STARIO and  so I hope that the
presentation of the games will a bit better in this games...
If you need new stuff for your  ST you must buy this  game because there aren't
more new  games of this kind around but if you searching for high-quality-stuff
you should get your hands off from this game...
