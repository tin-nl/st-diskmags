Since I have  seen some  videoclips (e.g. "Disarm" and "Luna") of this  band at
the  german music-channel VIVA I  was fascinated of  this music. And  so I have
bought this  album last week  and I hadn't  regret this. It's a  great piece of
music! The style is, I would say, a mix out of grunge, rock'n'roll and punk and
sounds fantastic and  sometimes a little bit  like NIRVANA... The  voice of the
singer  and the  smashing  sound with  wild guitarriffs, drums and violins gave
this album an incomparable note.
On this album are 13 songs:

- Cherub Rock
- Quiet
- Today
- Hummer
- Rocket
- Disarm
- Soma
- Geek U.S.A.
- Mayonaise
- Spaceboy
- Silverfuck
- Sweet Sweet
- Luna

You can hear many very heavy sounds and also some  slowly ballads. It's a hear-
experience without sameness... There is  only one possibility: You'll like this
sound or you  hate it, between this is nothing... The texts are a bit slanting,
there  are  passages  like "...break your  bones..." and "...bang, bang, You're
dead! A hole in Your head..." but they have  a real message  and so why. And if
you're not interested in more or less  sensfull songtexts you  can even jumping
and stomping around to this kind of music.
