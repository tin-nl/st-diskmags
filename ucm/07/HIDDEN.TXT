Yo,  here  it is: the hidden article. I wonder how you managed to find it. The
only  person  who  could have found it (at least I think so) is the incredible
Sebomat of Spirits ('coz he wrote the file-system!). I don't have much time to
write  loads  of  senseful  lines,  because  the mag isn't still ready and I'm
completely  demotivated.  I hate coding things like mags or intros or demos or
utilities... :-) And again some bad messages. Maybe tnb is dead today. I don't
know,  but  I'm going to set my status to 'undead', that means I won't code to
release  anymore.  I  will  continue  coding,  but  I have no plans to release
anything (maybe I'll continue 'lasse reinb³ng' but don't expect it in the near
future)  and  because  of  that  reason, tnb will break down soon. m.O.d. will
probably  join TSCC. I don't know about Moondogs future, but I'm going to form
a new group or reform tnb. So don't expect any big releases by tnb.
   The time of tnb was a funny time, but (maybe) it's over now...
