group   : Extream / Finland

This is 128intro has  made the  last place at the  Aggressive Party 2  and this
with very few votes and I think it was right placed. Before you ask me why I'll
tell you something more about this intro.
At first you  can see an  Extream-logo and a tracker-music starts to play. Both
isn't bad. But now... you can  see tons of  very colourfull  effex, but all are
the same effect, only with  different colors or  wafeforms! This demo remembers
a little bit on the BEDLAM demo  by CHAOS, done for the ST many years ago, even
if more colors are thrown around.
In the  year of  1995, after  demos  like "Terrorise Your Soul" you  can't show
only  plasma-effex in a 128Kdemo!
This  demo is, please excuse  this, only a boring and dull screen. I'll hope to
see better screens in the future. I don't know why this  screen is so lame when
the 4K-screen  by the same coder has won the second  place in the corresponding
competition?!
Ok, it isn't so lame like the 96Kdemo of Trantor for the Symposium '96, but its
one of the demos you don't need!
