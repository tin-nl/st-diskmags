 AGGRESSION 128 KB DEMO

group   : Aggression / Finland
system  : Falcon with RGB-monitor
release : Aggressive Party 2 - December 1995
credits : ?

This little screen  should be a preview of the long  awaited "Motion Blur" demo
which isn't released up to now. But if all the effex in  this demo will be look
like the latest productions of Aggression this demo will be extremely stunning!
After the smashing party-invitation-dentro with the great feedback-effects this
screen brings again a  brainblasting routine. After a little  intro-picture you
are flying  around in a 3D-landscape. It looks a little bit like a Wolfenstein-
rout but  isn't the  same. Ok, the  resolution is  a bit coarse and there is no
sound but for this  the flight is extremely fast and the screen features also a
mist-effect! It looks very fantastic and I think even if you're only interested
in bigger Falcon-demos you have to take a look at this little demo!
