All demos are Falcon only.

IMPULSE

They  have  rereleased  their Falcon demo 'BUGS FROM OUTER SPACE' at NAS 96 and
made the 1st place! They  won a Jaguar. They also  won the HTML-Coding-compo!

ICE

They celebrated  their comeback with 2 releases (look above). They made the 2nd
place at the democompetition and won a digitizer!

LYNX

An Cool, who recently joined Lynx, has  released his  last demo ever called the
KEFF Demo or Crystal demo. It's in the old M-Demo style with a nice Jungle-tune
playing in the background. He has released it under his  own name and not under
the Lynx-label? Why?

T.O.Y.S.

Peylow of T.O.Y.S. has  released a  4k-Pacman-clone  at the NAS'96. It's called
Toy-man and it's shareware. It's the 1st appearance from T.O.Y.S. on Falcon.

NEW BEAT DEVELOPMENT

They did a demo about Reine from Impulse called 'RGB Reine' or 'Dreimal'.

AGGRESSION

The Aggression effort is really lame! Not worth to mention!

IPIR

They have returned with another really lame thing called 'Silence return'!
Total bullshit!!!
