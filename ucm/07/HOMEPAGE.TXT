      SCENE-HOMEPAGES - PART ONE
     ---------------------------- {*f0

Yoho! Moondog is writing some shit again! You all knew the situation on the
Atari-Computers... There isn't many stuff to review and test, but after some
hours at the Internet-Cafe and a big Internet-session at LOT's home I had a
more or less good idea: Why we shouldn't review the homepages of the Atari-
Demo-Scene?! Who's top and who's not, wich pages are worth a look or not...
Short, we'll give you in this and the forthcoming issues of our reincarneted
magazine tips and hints for a little scene-related Internet-session...

Ok, I'll don't write more shit here and will start with the review of some
pages...

ACF DESIGN TEAM - Homepage {*f0

http://rzserv2.fh-lueneburg.de:8080/

This page is one  of the  oldest Atari-Demo-Scene-pages and  still supported by
JACKY of ACF. This  page is nearly  the only lifesign  of this, in former times
wellknown, old german demogroup.
This page isn't only  very well designed  with handmade bitmap-grafix and logos
by Agent-t-, no it  contains a  lot of features! You  can read  something about
the scene on  ST and Falcon, ALL  Atari-Computers in general, you can enter the
"Chatroom" to talk  with other  guys. You can  send  an  email to JACKY and the
best feature (I think so) is that you  can jump to other (scene)-pages all over
europe!
The update-rate is  relative high and so you should contact  this page at least
one time monthly...
The page itself is also  very easy to handle. All in one this is the absolutely
best page in Germany and if you want to  enter the scene-corner of the Internet
you should go at first to this page...

All in one...

ANIMAL MINE - Homepage {*f0

http://www.muc.de/~strata/animal_mine.html

This is one  of the newest pages in Germany and was made by the, also in former
times, wellknown and very active demo- and cd-group or at least by their member
STRATAGEM. He was  running the also  very wellknown DREAMSCAPE BBS, one  of the
leading german scene-boards, before.
He kills with this homepage all the rumors of the death of ANIMAL MINE.
This page  is also very well  styled, even  if AM haven't any gfx-men left. You
can  read informations  about the  scene, esp. the  last AM-Convention, look at
some pictures or download something. Also a Link-corner to other scene-pages is
present. Anything  else? No, only greetings  and so one  and so this page isn't
by far as interesting as the page of ACF...
