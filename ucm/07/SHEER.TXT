After the Falcon-version was released some months ago now also the ST-users can
play this game...
In this  game you're poisened and you have about 3 hours  to find the antidote.
You must  search for  this in  an old house  of a very  strange family. All the
members of this  family were  killed or died  by an  unnatural death. They were
very skilled magicians and you can learn by your search something about them.
Also  putting together  the antidote is  based on magic. You have to search for
the recipe and the ingredients for a long time...
Ok, that's it. The  grafix in  the game  are all  digitized (the same as in the
Falcon-version, but converted) and  looking sometimes  very good, even  if they
containing only 16 colors. The pixeled grafix in the intro and the end are only
mediocre and also the presentation of the game isn't up to date.
On my  ST I had  heard nearly  no sound. Only  some little beeps by the chip. I
don't know if this is right.
You can play  the game in 3  different languages, even if the  translations are
sometimes a bit  ridiculous but where  you can get today  a game in 3 different
languages on the ST? So this is a little bonus-point for the game.
Because you have  time-limit the game is fast finished, when the single puzzles
are solved in time. But you can also die in this game, when  you make very dull
things (drinking of  solvents, jumping in the little lake behind  the house...)
and your view fades away.
The game is controled by the mouse  and it's easy  to handle. Sometimes it is a
bit in the way that  you can transport  only 9 things in your bag because there
are many different items to find... Sometimes  it's also a bit hard to find the
one or other secret because you can't see it at the first time.
All in one this is game for  puzzle-freaks. Up to now I haven't finished it and
I must start it again and  again. Because of  the loading-times you should copy
the game to your harddisk. Sometimes  it's a bit  boring when  you must go to a
place when you have seen all the other rooms before and because of the loading-
times the motivation can fly away.
When you like grafix-adventures you should get the game beacuse  the grafix are
sometimes a bit atmospheric. Fans of  actions-adventures  like Monkey Island or
Loom should take her hands of this game.
