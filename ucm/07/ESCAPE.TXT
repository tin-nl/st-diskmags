                        A NEW TRUECOLOR PAINTING TOOL

autor  : No / Escape
system : Falcon, 4 MB RAM, TV / RGB / VGA-monitor, harddisk
status : freeware

Yup, here comes another painting-program. You  all surely knew my problems. I'm
a NeoChrome Master  fanatic and so nearly all painting-program  around are more
or less useless and shitty in my eyes. I don't like Delmpaint (Schelmpaint ;-),
Indypaint or Godpaint. This  programs are  in fact full filled of good features
but I don't like the handling. I hope you know what I mean...
On the Intercon I've received a version of this new painting-program  and becoz
I'm searchin' hard for a program on the Falcon I have installed it on my Falcon
and... it runs perfectly, also under NVDI and Screenblaster... BUT... the first
thing what appears on the screen was a GEM-based menu with differend boxes...
Oh, shit! Not  another GEM-program! But  than cames  the surprise. The  program
offers two different magnify-types, Degas Elite or Neo Master. And when  you've
entered the painting-screen it isn't a GEM-program anymore. In  the Neo-magnify
you will see a screen which remembers a little bit to the best painting-prog on
the ST. You have a color-selection, some kind of painting-options (lines, boxes
and circles) and a realtime-magnify with different resolutions.
Ok the ground-functions  are  avaiable  and  so  you  can paint simple pictures
without  problems. But if  you will use the other  options of the program, like
anitaliasing, rotating, copying or so one, you must go back to the GEM and this
sucks. Because  in  the  Neo  Master  mode  there  is  many  space left I don't
understand why this options aren't integrated here.
Because of  this the program  isn't easy to handle in my eyes. You may say that
I shouldn't  demand to much from  a freeware-program but I need a program which
is very easy to handle (even for an idiot) and not one where I must jump around
between different screens and menus.
Ok, back  to the facts. The program contains also 5 module-slots and so you can
code your own modules for use with this program.
You can work on 3 different pictures at the same time.
One point I don't  understand is, that  only  true-color-picture-formats can be
loaded or saved. You can't load Gif or IFF and also no NEO or Degas-formats...
But hopefully there will be more formats included in later versions.

At last here are all features in a short survey:

painting-tools
- drawing
- lines
- rectangle
- circles
- polylines
- boxes
- fill-option
- text
- block-cutting
- block-putting

block-edit
- negative block
- antialiase block
- recut block
- scaling
- rotating
- x- and y-mirror
- block-options (transparent, bakcground, rgb etc.)

extern modules
- 4 different filter-modules (brighten etc.) are included

zoom and magnify
- 2 different zoom-types (NeoChrome Master and Degas Elite) with grid
- realtime-zoom
- 4 different magnify-types (3:1, 5:1, 7:1, 9:1)

disk-options
- following picture-formats can be loaded: GOD, PI9, TGA, TPI, TRP, TRU, XGA
- following picture-formats can be saved: TRP, XGA
- palette can be saved as: INDY or EPP
- blocks can be saved as: TRP or TRU

Hum, what  should I say. A nice try but this program needs some months more for
development. This time it contains only the usual painting-tools and no special
things (take a look at the Rainbow 2 article)...
Good is that the program runs without any problems on VGA and under NVDI / SB.
I'll  hope that there  will be more  improvements in the  next versions because
there are some good first signs...
If you're a painter  you can get  it and see by yourself  what's good or bad on
this  little  tool, remember: it's  freeware - you  can take  a look at  it for
nothing and so why not?
