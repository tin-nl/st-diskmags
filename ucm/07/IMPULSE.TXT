You will  surely remember to the game ARKANOID, which  was released on the good
old Atari ST before nearly 10 years by  Taito or you have surely  played one of
the thousands of Break-out-clones on the several computer-systems.
So, if you  have missed such  a game for the  Falcon you should immediately get
this game! IMPULSE is the best  Arkanoid/Breakout-clone  I've ever  seen on the
Falcon and all other systems up to now!
The game is also much better as some commercial releases! Yawn!
I wouldn't say something about the game itself because I hope you all know this
type of games and I will change to the technical side.
Ok, only the game-intro  shows that the  makers have worked hard on it! The gfx
are very nice and it seems that they are rendered, in truecolor of course.
The game  itself runs  in fullscreen. At  first it looks  like the ST or Amiga-
version of ARKANOID but  when the first sprites  appearing on the screen you'll
change your opinion. The sprites are also  rendered and very  well animated! So
you can see shaded apples, glasballs and vectors  turning around on the screen.
The explosions, when  they were  touched by  the  ball or  your hit seems to be
digitized or so one. Cool!
In the game you  have the usual  extras like  glue, long hit, laser and so one.
Every 100.000 points you will receive an extra-life.
The sound is good in the intro and the fx aren't bad but the module in the game
is absolutely too old! But this is the only minus-point.
There is a saveable  highscore-list and  for the 40  levels you can  get a code
every 5th level and so you must start at the baby-level everytime.
This is a game like it's proper! It's much  better than the most sharewaregames
or even some commercial games on the Falcon! Get it!
