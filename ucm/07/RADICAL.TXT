RADICAL RACE sounds  very hard, brutal or interesting. At first you're thinking
on a game like Destruction Derby at the Playstation, but it isn't...
Ok, after  installing the  3 HD-disx to  the harddisk  the game is  bigger than
Moongames or the most  other Falcon-games (also commercial) and this  makes the
game much  more interesting: Why  the hell is it so  fucking big? This contains
surely many grafix etc... yam...
Ok, after starting the game on  my VGA-monitor some  nice hires-pictures appear
on the screen and... Wow! In a fantastic animation a logo explodes on the moni,
also in  hires! Great! I'm  remembering  to some PC or  Amiga-games  which have
usually also great intro-sequences...
Than the menu  and option-screens, all are presented  in SVGA and  looking very
professional and I can't expect the game itself...
After I  have chosen  one player  the game  starts and, yawn! It's SUPER CARS?!
What?! It  looks like  Super Cars, the grafix are very similar looking and also
the control is the same (sorry, shit) like in this old game...
Yes, RADICAL RACE is nothing more as  SUPER CARS for the Falcon! You're driving
around on a parcours in birds-eye view. On the route are driving some more cars
around which were controled by the computer. There are 3 different  game-modes,
the training, the  race and  the car-war. The  first  two must be clear. In the
third mode you must fight against the other cars with  machine-gun and mine and
you can blow them away to be the first on the finish...
Oh boy! What I had hated SUPER CARS! I had played the game some  years ago many
times on the Amiga of my brother and I can remember the fucking control! Shit!
Since this times I hate games like SUPER CARS, sorry...
Ok, this thing is, apart  from the game  itself, very  well presented and has a
touch of commercial  feeling. I've  never seen a so  good presented game on the
Falcon up to now... very nice SVGA-grafix...
The sound is also very good. Cool music and nice FX...
But the  control... aaarf... You can  use pad, stick or keys... it's always the
same. I know, a game  like this can't  very differently  controled but not like
this here... Sorry... Because of this you (or at least I) can't  play the first
level because you must jump over the other road  at one point and this directly
after a curve and  so I crashed everytime... Hm, eventually I'm to lame to play
this game but I don't think  so because I had played  also STARDUST which has a
similar control and I liked the game very much...
Hum, ok, if  you're  a fan of SUPER CARS  you must  have this game. The  others
should play at first a round before ordering the final game...
