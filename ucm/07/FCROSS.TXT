FCROSS has a really simple-game-system. It reminds a little bit on MINESWEEPER.
You have a playfield of 16*16 fields. On the sides of the board stands how many
free and  occupied fields are on the playfield. Your task is to find out, which
fields are free or not. You have to mark the fields with the mouse. If you have
an error you will loose a bit of your playtime (30 min total leveltime). If you
have all fields marked the level is solved.
The game  contains about  20 levels. The objects are very easy at the beginning
but after some levels it is much harder to solve the single playfields...
The presentation  of the game is very  simple. You can hear a little soundtrack
or simple ripped samples. The grafix  looking a bit cruel at the intro and also
in the game there isn't much  to  look at, but who cares? The game itself isn't
bad and you have to work  some time to solve  all the levels. The  control over
the mouse  is extremly  simple  and with  the levelcodes  you must not play the
lamer levels all the time...
The result: a funny little  game for the lunch break with  real simple gameplay
            but also with a lack of presentation
