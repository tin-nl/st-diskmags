      THE ATARI-SCENE IN GERMANY
    ------------------------------ {*f0

I think you'll remember the good old  AMAZINE (RIP) and his scene-reports. Now,
nearly 3 years after  the last issue of this great magazine I'll try to made an
update of this scene-overviews and I start with the german scene...
In former times  the german demo- and  cracker-scene was very powerful. I think
you can  remember the  names TEX, DELTA FORCE, ACF, BMT or ANIMAL MINE.
And you can  also surely  remember to  the years of 1993/94 as the german scene
splits up in a Falcon- and ST-section. This was  the beginning of the ending of
one of the biggest scenes of all times.
Many groups died or have slowed down their activities to zero. The  most groups
changed  completely to  the Falcon (they've  founded the wellknown INDEPENDENT)
and nearly all of the little rest has quited the scene...
Ok, I'll stop this and start this report...

I'll remark that  I don't count BBS  or Internet-activities as life-signs. Only
if the group has released something in the last months I'll count them as alive
and active... Also only single  modules or  pictures of  members of this groups
weren't counted as lifesign...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ABSENCE / INDEPENDENT {*f0

This group is relative new on the Atari and get together of  several members of
former INDEPENDENT  groups. This band is  also one of the last active groups of
the INDY. They're releasing  some demostuff  and they  have done  also the game
CONFUSION on the Falcon.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Bull, Front 6, Mr. Coke, Stallion, The Avatar, The Innovator
system      - only Falcon
products    - demos and games

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ADM TEAM {*f0

This are  the makers  of the  Atari Dream Machines diskmag. Ok, this  isn't the
reason to  count them  here. They've (or at least under their label) released a
little (even if it was total bullshit) demo at the Symposium this year.
So there is eventually more stuff to come besides the magazine.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Tinosoft, Trantor
system      - only Falcon
products    - magazines

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ALIEN CRACKING FORMATION {*f0

In the last  time the  rumours about a massive comeback  of this very old group
are were reinforced and I'll hope that  this isn't only hot air... I think this
can be the surprise of the year if it's true...

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Jacky, Pooky (...?)
system      - ST only
products    - nothing since 1994 (Nightbox Porno-Show)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ANIMAL MINE / INDEPENDENT {*f0

Yes, they're  still alive! But I don't  know if I should count their release of
the GSC #66 preview  as lifesign... Nearly all  old members have left the group
and even if they have organized a new party this year ANIMAL MINE isn't more as
a shadow... Think on that  they're working since over 2 years on their GSC #66!
I don't think that they will release this compact disk in the future...

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Sethos, Stratagem, Titan (...?)
system      - ST and Falcon (?)
products    - last release in 1995 (preview of their GSC #66)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
AURA / INDEPENDENT {*f0

AURA has the  same problems  like ANIMAL MINE... Many members  have leaved this
group and only  three members are left. It's a  question of time till this band
will be finally dead. It's sad...

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Aeon, BDC, Chris
system      - Falcon only
products    - last demo in 1995 (E.X Illusion)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
AVENA {*f0

Also this band is still alive even if  only the british member Tat has released
the last thing (an ST-intro (!) and a  new shell  for Maggie 21 ST). The german
"section" is  working mainly on  the Avena Assembler. I don't know if new demos
are planned...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Fried, Jet, Metallix, Tat, Tommi
system      - Falcon and ST
products    - demos and tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
CHECKPOINT {*f0

This is also a relaitve new  group. They're working only  on ST. I've been told
that there are 4 members but I  have only the  names of two. They've released a
little ST-screen at the INTERcon. The coder  seems to be  very skilled and so I
think we can wait for more stuff from them.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - 505, Defjam (...?)
system      - ST only
products    - demos

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
CREAM {*f0

This group  is very  productive since some months. They've released  some demos
and also  a SID-emulation for  the STE and Falcon  and there  is more  stuff to
come...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Abyss, A.-t-, Candyman, Tao
system      - ST and Falcon
products    - demos

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
CRUOR {*f0

This group, which  had his  first demo  released  on the  Fried Bits 3 is still
alive and has released some more  demostuff. This time they're working on their
shot'em'up-game for the Falcon but I've heard also of a new demo...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Raving Mad, Zweckform
system      - Falcon only
products    - demos and games (96ktro at the Symposium this year)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
DETONATORS {*f0

It seems that  this group is finally  died. Since nearly 2 years I haven't seen
something  new of  them even if they have promised a comeback... Ok, we'll wait
for some  months but  I don't think that  there will  be a new release  by this
group...

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Beweise, HCL, NoFX
system      - ST
products    - nothing since 1994 (Mailbox intro)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ELITE - GERMANY {*f0

The german section of the reformed hacking-band is alive since some  months and
get together  of two members  of older groups. This time they aren't productive
but The Attacking Shark (one of  the members) isn't  a bad  coder (remember  to
some crack-intros for Cynix or I.C.S.) and so there can be new stuff sometimes.
It seems that this group has  managed their  comeback  and so  VECTRONIX aren't
alone anymore in Germany.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Stratagem, The Attacking Shark
system      - ST and Falcon
releases    - nothing up to now by ELITE - GERMANY

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
ESCAPE {*f0

This seems  to be a very  new group. I've  seen a Falcon-painting-tool by them,
called EscAPE PAINT and they've won the 1st place in the  4K-competition at the
INTERcon '96... Only one member is known

scene-state - alive and active
members     - No (...?)
system      - Falcon only
releases    - demos and tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
INTER / INDEPENDENT {*f0

At first I've tought that  Inter are sleeping, because I haven't seen something
since months of them. But now, after  the INTERcon I must change my mind. Inter
are still here and they're still active  on the Falcon, even if they're working
on several PC-projects.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Lucky of ST, Nightmare, Questor, Pater Michael, Samurai, Zonk
system      - Falcon only
releases    - demos (last one the invitation for the INTERcon and a 4Kintro)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
LIGHT {*f0

This group is  dead as scene-group. The name  is still existing and the members
of this  crew were  on  the most big  parties. But nothing more. There  will be
surely no new production... It's sad but true...

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
members     - Leviathan, MegaTri, Percy, Mr. XY, Dan H.
system      - Falcon only
releases    - last demo in 1993 (680XX-Convention)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
MUGWUMPS / INDEPENDENT {*f0

This group is surely dead, because I haven't seen something (except some plasma
pictures by Herm for  the E.X Illusion Demo by Aura) from them. I've heard of a
new demo  but I'll think this  will never  be released... They were also on the
INTERcon but I haven't seen new stuff...

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
system      - Falcon only
releases    - only one big demo in 1994 (Cyceldelic Knockout)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
NEWLINE / INDEPENDENT {*f0

This group  is one of  the oldest groups in  this list. But they're nearly dead
because the most  members have leaved the band in the  last year. I think there
will be nothing released anymore by NEWLINE.

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
members     - Juri, (JMS ?)
system      - nothing
releases    - nothing since 1994

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
NEW POWER GENERATION {*f0

I've heard that  this group is working on a new demo and because I've seen some
activities on the  Symposium-party I  wouldn't count them as dead. Because they
have stopped their game-project INCUBATOR (they've worked for nearly 3 years on
it) they've the resources  to do a new demo. But  up to now I haven't seen some
interesting new of them...

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Carnera, Jaron
system      - Falcon only
releases    - last demo 1994 (Plan9 96Ktro)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
NEW TREND {*f0

This group  is  finally dead  as demo-group. This  is sure. There are  only two
members left and they're working on a game for the Falcon. I don't know if they
will quit finally after this...

scene-state - alive on Atari, but DEAD as demo-group
members     - Dragon, Lig Lury
system      - Falcon only
releases    - last demo 1994 (Strange Circumstances), now working on games only

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
PSYCHONOMIX {*f0

This group  had released  only one  demo, at the  Fried Bits in 1993. Then this
group  was dissolved  because the most  members changed to AVENA. But 1994 some
ex-members reformed the group. I haven't seen something from them up to now and
I think there will be nothing more come from them in the future...

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
members     - Corpsegrinder, Manitou (...?)
system      - ST and Falcon
releases    - nothing since april 1993

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
RISK / INDEPENDENT {*f0

Also this  very old  group seems to be  dead. Since  over three years I haven't
seen  anything  from them, except  some  little  tools. Some  members are still
working but not for RISK itself. I've heard some rumours  about a comeback with
a game but I'll believe it only if I have seen this...

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
members     - McFly, Ripguy, Sepp Jo (...?)
system      - nothing
releases    - nothing since 1993

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
SPIRITS {*f0

This two ex-tnb-spacks have after her first demo in 1995 said that they'll stop
computing  but they  have released  another  demo this year. They  want to stop
finally  but now I've  heard that they  will comeback  once more... I  hope so,
because they're magnificent coders, even if they have some very strange views.

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Connor, Seboz
system      - Falcon only
releases    - demos and games (Ewigkeit 4Kintro for the Symposium this year)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
STAX {*f0

This is the last german  compact-group which  releases demo-disx. Unfortunately
the group  slows down all activities  except  the compacts and so there will be
eventually no new demo released by them...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Bod, Matt, Mike
system      - ST only
products    - demo-compact-disx (no. 137 in september)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE 42-CREW {*f0

Up to now I  don't know if the -real- 42-Crew of the earlier  days of the ST is
standing behind this band... Some guys say yes and some other meaning that this
band has  cracked  Dynabusters (but it doesn't run after this, hehehe)  only to
fuck T.S.C.C. and is real  another group.
I don't know but  the last possibility sounds very  convincend because no other
games were cracked under this label up to now...

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as scene-group
members     - (...?)
system      - nothing
products    - nothing since 1995 ("crack" of Dynabusters)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE CHAOS ENGINE {*f0

I haven't heard much from this guys. They had released  some little screens and
music-disx  for the Falcon  in former times  but now is radiosilence since over
a year... We're  owing the  famous DSP-player  to this  group or at least their
member bITmASTER.

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Akira, bITmASTER, Energy, Horizon, Phygozator, Secret Top
              The Byte
system      - Falcon only
products    - demos and music-disx

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE NAUGHTY BYTES {*f0

Yes! We're alive and will entertain you much more (even if only the half of our
group is active) and not only with our magazin because a new and  brainblasting
demo for  the ST and Falcon is coming up! Just wait and see...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Drizzt, FXL, Gary, Lot, mOd, Moondog (Flash?)
system      - ST and Falcon
products    - demos and diskmag

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THERAPY {*f0

This is also  a relative new name on the Atari. The group exists only since two
years but has released much stuff up to now. Besides 3 demos and intros they've
done a game and a  magnificent picture-converter up to now and there is more to
come, hopefully.

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Coke, Dale, Dodger, Jailbird, Nohow
system      - Falcon only
products    - demos, tools and games (last demo on the GigaFun - 08/96)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE RESPECTABLES {*f0

This  group is surely  dead, even  if the members  are still  alive with  their
pseudonyms and so we can't expect some new releases by them.
(He Tyrem! Do  you  remembering the  interview for  Undercover 2? Where  is the
promised megademo? 3 years to  manage a  demo which was  ready for 80%?! It's a
bad joke...)

scene-state - only the name is still existent -> but dead as demo-group
members     - Duke, Hawkmoon, Tyrem
system      - nothing
products    - nothing since 1993 (Cebit '93 Demo)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE RUHRPOTT CONNECTION {*f0

I don't know if this group is still alive or if they have something released up
to now. I think they're at least sleeping (or they're dead...). There are three
members known.

scene-state - alive but sleeping
members     - Cubase, Gem, Nina
system      - ST only
products    - nothing up to now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORP. {*f0

After  they've telled that  they will stop  their work for some time at the end
of the last year they  have released more stuff as other groups which are still
alive... This group will surely survive the most other groups in Germany, becoz
even if  they have  stopped (good joke) they  have more  stuff released as some
bands which are still here and meaning to be alive...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Dynacore, Llama, MC Laser, Scy
system      - ST and Falcon
products    - demos and module-disx (Module Compil 11 - 11/96)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
TUMULT {*f0

This  is the newest group  in Germany and they're  releasing  compact-disx with
cracked stuff on it... So long  cracking-bands  are around  which are releasing
enough stuff this band will survive...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Captain Future, HD Crash, Immortality, Vince Clotho
system      - ST only
products    - crack-compact-disx (up to volume 10)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {*f1
VECTRONIX {*f0

Vectronix are the most productive cracking-group on the Atari. Because some new
members have joined in, this band will surely be active for long times. They've
released much more stuff as all the other cracking-bands together...

scene-state - alive and active
members     - Hardball, Jabba, Lonsdale, Metallinos, Moonfall, Twilight
system      - ST and Falcon
products    - cracks'n'hacks (Full Jaguar Development Kit)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

alive and active                       - 15 groups
alive but sleeping                     -  8 groups
"Zombies" (only names existent)        -  8 groups

And here  I haven't  mentioned bands like Game Over, Sound Connexion and others
which haven't never released only the smallest screen. I haven't also mentioned
guys  of groups which haven't  released something  since many years (like TEX),
because  it's senseless to count  a group  only because some members are active
under her old pseudonyms...
After this  you can see  that the german scene has too many corpses and zombies
in the basement. Only a part of the mentioned groups is  still active and gives
the Atari-users a little sign to stay  on the machines... The others are living
of her old fame and are in fact dead. Please remember, the scene don't need old
band-names or guys which are thinking that they're the real elite, no our scene
needs productions! I don't care  if this will be  a simple little screen or the
biggest megademo ever, the main thing is that at all something will be released
for the  ST and Falcon... Some  guys meaning that it's too boring to code demos
or intros, but why they're still here?! Only to  be mentioned in the greetings-
lists of the  other, real  productive, bands?! It  seems so... This is  a crude
thing and so please go away and don't irritate the last survivors...

OK. This is all for now... I'll hope this list is complete. If some information
must be updated please write us or  leave us a  message in THE JUNCTION BBS. It
would be nice if you would help us to keep this list up-to-date...
