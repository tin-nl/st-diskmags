I don't know  if this demo is finally released now. I have heard that it should
be released at the  Intercon, but I haven't  received this final  version. So I
must  review this preview. I'll hope that nobody will  fuck me because of this,
but I think  it's time to  inform the Falcon-users  about this mysterious demo,
which should be released originally at the Symposium '96...
Ok, I've a copy of the preview and  I must say at first that this thing doesn't
run  correctly. It bugs  again and again but I have seen all  the parts yet and
also on the Intercon and so I'll start the review now...
After clicking on the  prg-file the  desk still stays on the screen and you can
hear a rumbling noise. Than a logo apears  on the desk and the screen splits up
to many little pieces and falls back... Ups?! Where have I seen this before?!
Yes! This  intro is  a remake of  the Indy-dentro for the Fried Bits 2! I don't
know why it was used again. Ok, it's a nice effect, but over two years old now.
The noises  changing to  a tune which  remembering me  to an old trance-track I
have on one of my old cd's. The music is done by Stax / Lazer and quiet good as
always...
You can see a little starfield  on the screen and 2 big texture-mapped and also
shaded balls on the screen. Than the title-logo was faded in by a nice routine,
which I haven't seen up to now...
The  black background  changes to a colourfull  plasma-pic (or so one) and  the
whole screen begins to distorting like water. Looks good but was shown too long
on the screen.
At next the gimmick of the Symposium '96 appears on the screen, again by a nice
fade-routine.
Than you can see a distorting plasma-tunnel on the screen and another pic comes
to the screen. After this another tunnel comes up and... I've seen this before!
It was released  some times ago. It  looks like marble and is quiet good, but I
don't understand why already released routz were be shown again in a demo...
I don't know...
After another  little tunnel, this  time it's  textured, distorting  rasterbars
coming up, its a nice but boring effect.
At next  another distorter appears on the screen. This one looks like water and
is good, even if the resolution is a bit coarse.
Now follows a cyber-picture with a photorealistic girl on it and another water-
effect comes to your screen. This time you can see a girl laying besides a pool
or something like that and the "water" in this pool distortes and flows around.
At last comes the endpart with the credits and so one.
Ready... Hum. This demo left a split impression in my mind. At the one side are
some cool  routs and a nice  sound-track. At the other side the demo suffers on
the  lack of design  and the  already known screens... Ok, it's a good demo, no
question, but there are better demos around, sorry.
In one  point I was  scratching on  my head because it can't be that such a big
staff must  work to together today to  release such a demo... I can remember on
times where every group has released such a big (or bigger) demo. But this demo
shows that the german Falcon-scene is standing KO...
