As I had received the demo I was very surprised about the makers... The Misfits
were some  years ago on the ST very active. They had  released screens in demos
of The Future Minds and also some nice games. Than there was  nothing for about
4 years and now they're back (I don't know if the members are the same as then.
Ok, lets take a look at their new work...
The demo  starts with  a rotating  starfield and again a crazy music by Maf. It
sound very similar to the one in the Toons-demo, but I like it also very much.
Than big vector-balls are turning around on the screen, like in the Toons-demo.
After another effect I can't describe (TSCC have a similar  one in their Flight
Over Sirius demo released on the ST) and  a zooming tortue you can see in front
of texture some shaded splines in  different waveforms. A little box was opened
in the background and you can see a highres-rotozoom.
After a change of the  background-grafix  you can see  texture-mapping-vex with
rotating grafix, gouraudshading-vectors (also  with plasmas), burning  line-vex
and another fire-effect.
After this there are some colored dots (DSP?) and the mainpart is over...
At the end-screen you can see the usual scroller with some z-buffering-balls in
the background...
That's  all. The  demo  shows  only known effex. They're  nice but  always seen
before. There aren't many grafix but they're also ok (the Teddy-bear is nice).
The design could  be much more  continuous. The sound is the best... again very
funny and nice to hear with some crazy samples...
The demo isn't bad and a good one for a comeback but it isn't brainblasting.
It's good for one or two sessions but than the most will delete it again.
