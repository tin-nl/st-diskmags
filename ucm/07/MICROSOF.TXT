        THE MAN FROM MICROSOFT
       ------------------------{*f0

There was a knock on the door. It was the man from Microsoft.

"Not you again," I said.

"Sorry," he said, a little sheepishly. "I guess you know why I'm here."

Indeed  I did. Microsoft's $300  million  campaign  to  promote  the  Windows95
operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince every human
being on  the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some would say integral,
part of living. Problem was, not everyone had bought it.
Specifically, I hadn't  bought it. I was  the  Last Human Being Without Windows
95. And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and he wouldn't take
no for an answer.

"No," I said.

"You know I can't take that," he  said, pulling out  a copy  of  Windows95 from
a briefcase. "Come on. Just one copy. That's all we  ask."

"Not interested." I said. "Look, isn't there someone else you can go bother for
a while? There's got to be someone else on the planet who doesn't have a copy."

"Well, no," The Microsoft man said. "You're the only one."

"You can't  be serious. Not  everyone on  the planet  has a  computer," I said.
"Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC! Some  people own Macintoshes, Atari
or Amiga  which run their  own operating systems. And some people  who have PCs
run OS/2, though  I hear that's just a rumor. In  short, there  are some people
who just have no use for Windows 95."

The Microsoft man look perplexed. "I'm missing your point," he  said.

"Use!" I screamed. "Use! Use! Use! Why BUY it, if you can't USE it?"

"Well, I don't know  anything about  this 'use' thing you're  going on  about,"
The Microsoft man said. "All I know is that according  to our records, everyone
else on the planet has a copy."

"People without computers?" "Got 'em." "Amazonian Indians?" "We had to get some
malaria shots to go in, but yes."  "The Amish." "Check."

"Oh, come on," I said. "They don't even  wear BUTTONS. How did you  get them to
buy a computer operating system?"

"We told  them  there  were  actually  95 very small  windows in  the box," the
Microsoft man admitted. "We sort of lied. Which means we are all going to Hell,
every  single  employee of  Microsoft." He was  somber for a  minute, but  then
perked right  up. "But that's not the point!" he said. "The  point is, EVERYONE
has a copy. Except you."

"So what?" I said. "If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you expect me to
do it, too?"

"If we spent $300 million advertising it? Absolutely."

"No."

"Jeez, back to that again," the Microsoft  man said. "Hey. I'll tell  you what.
I'll GIVE you  a copy. For free. Just take it and install it on your computer."
He waved the box in front of me.

"No," I said  again. "No offense, pal. But  I don't need it. And  frankly, your
whole  advertising  blitz  has  sort  of offended me. I  mean, it's a  computer
operating system! Great. Fine. Swell. Whatever. But  you guys  are  advertising
it like it creates world peace or something."

"It did." "Pardon?" "World peace. It was part  of the original  design. Really.
One  button  access. Click on it, poof, end to strife and  hunger. Simple." "So
what happened?"

"Well, you know," he said. "It took up a lot of space on the hard drive. We had
to decide between it or the Microsoft Network. Anyway, we  couldn't  figure out
how to make a profit off of world peace."

"Go away," I said.

"I can't," he said. "I'll be killed if I fail."

"You have got to be kidding," I said.

"Look," the Microsoft man said, "We  sold this  to the  AMISH. The Amish! Right
now, they're  opening the  boxes and  figuring out  they've been  had. We'll be
pitchforked if we ever step into Western  Pennsyvania again. But we  did it. So
to  have  YOU  holding  out, well, it's  embarassing. It's  embarassing  to the
company. It's embarassing to the product. It's embarassing to BILL."

"Bill Gates does not care about me," I said.

"He's  watching  right now," the  Microsoft man  said. "Borrowed  one  of those
military  spy satellites just for the purpose. It's also got one of those high-
powered lasers. You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of grey ash."

"He  wouldn't  do  that," I said, "He  might  hit  that  copy  of  Windows95 by
accident."

"Oh, Bill's  gotten  pretty good  with  that  laser," the  Microsoft man  said,
nervously. "Okay. I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no  choice. If
you take this copy of Windows95, we will  reward you handsomely. In fact, we'll
give you your own Caribbean island! How does Montserrat sound?"

"Terrible. There's  an  active  volcano  there." - "It's only a small one," the
Microsoft man said.

"Look," I said, "even if you DID convince me to  take that copy  of  Windows95,
what would  you do then? You'd have totally saturated the market. That would be
it. No new worlds to conquer. What would you do then?"

The Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.

"'Windows 95....For Pets'?!?!?" "There's a LOT of domestic  animals out there,"
he said.

I shut the door quickly. There was a surprised yelp, the sound of a  laser, and
then nothing.

                                                               from someone BBS
