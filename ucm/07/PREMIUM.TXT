PREMIUM MAHJONGG  is  a  wellknown  chinese  boardgame. I think  you've  played
allready a version of this game. There are many games out there like TAUTOLOGY,
DRACHEN or the game in a DELTA FORCE-demo...
Ok, you've a board with many stones  with different signs on it. You must clear
this board while searching  pairs of same  stones. The  problem is that you can
only get the stones of the left or right border of the playfield. Another thing
is that the  stones are  piled up to a  little pyramid and so you can move only
the stones of the top of this pile...
You can play this game  in 2 different modes. At first at the Solitair-mode and
here you haven't a time-limit. Only  if you will  break the highscores you must
play faster but this brings the  problem that  you move the false stones and so
you can't go on sometimes...
The second mode is the tournament-mode. Here you must play against a time-limit
but you can define this by yourself.
The game  itself is a little bit hard. Up  to now  I hadn't  cleared  the board
completely. Always I was "checkmate"...
The technical side... The  game runs on  every TOS-compatible machine, from the
ST up to  the Falcon. It runs in different resolutions and also in SVGA with 16
colors (Falcon/TT). The last resolution  looks very  nice. On the ST the grafix
aren't bad but a bit intricate.
There is no sound in  the game and  I think a little  music were nice and above
all feasible  been... But  because it's a GEM-game you  can play  some music by
background-players, I think so...
The control over the mouse is easy, there are many options and also a highscore
list (Look at our stuff-disk! There is a  highscore-manager for this game which
allows to manage up to 10.000 highscores!!!).
Ok. All in one this game isn't bad and a little pause-filler, even if it's hard
to play... The registration brings only the  possibility to save 100 highscore-
entrys. This version here can only save 50. So I think you must not register by
all means because the game isn't limited...
