I know, this  game isn't  new but I had  not much ST-stuff for review this time
and because it wasn't reviewed in  Undercover up to now I have deceided to take
a look at this game for you...
WELL ARD is a nice (for shareware) jump'n'run-game which remembers a little bit
on Chuck Rock or so one.
After some info-pages and logos you  can start the  game. If you  have the code
(only for registered users) you  can play the  complete game. If you can't type
in any code the game starts  in shareware-mode (you  can only play the first of
four worlds).
You must control a little  ugly (a tough freaky guy)  sprite through a fantasy-
world and collect some  diamonds (or so). You can  run and jump. There are many
different enemies  on the  screen, like slugs, insects  and also some obstacles
like pits in your way. You must  collect all the  diamonds or crystals to leave
the level. Sometimes its a bit tricky to get them because the control isn't the
best thing on this game.
Ok, the technical side. The  grafix are very well drawn. The logos in the intro
and also the sprites and  blocks in the game  itself are  very good  for a game
which was released as shareware. The sprites are also good animated...
The sound isn't so good as the grafix. In the intro you can hear a Mad Max tune
and in the game itself only some bleeps and blops made of the soundchip.
The control is a bit tricky. Ok, your sprite moves fast and react spontaneously
but to jump to some places is sometimes a bit frustrating.
Ok, all in  one this  game is  well done  and you  can't expect more for only 5
pounds.
PS. The fourth level  will be a shot'em'up and so the action-fans should take a
    look at this tiny little game!
