Yet another game from  Markus Binder and like all  his games  this one  is also
coded in Omikron.Basic...
This time you  have to drive, ehem, fly  with your yellowcab over the screen to
some bases to collect passengers.
This is all what you have to do... I know, the idea is extremely old and also a
bit boring but real this game would be a neat breakfiller if the technical side
were a little bit better...
The grafix, ok, they're in HiRes but in 16 colors only and only one very little
sprite is moving around on the screen, your taxi...
The sound is shit! Only some beeps  and klongs are coming out  of the speakers,
it sounds terrible for a Falcon-game...
There  is no  playability. You  can't  control your  ship right  and so  you're
smashing again and  again against the landscape or the borders of the playfield
and this  means -dead-. So you have to load the  game again and again and after
the extremely though intro the motivation flows away...
The result: No one  needs this  game. It's  only for  perverts  which  want  to
struggle themselves. There is much better and cheapier stuff around...
