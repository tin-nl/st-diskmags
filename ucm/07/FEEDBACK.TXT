Ok, the most  of you will surely not  write any  article for us but if you have
received our magazine and you have something to say about it, even if this will
be  positive or negative  criticism, or if  you have any  suggestions or notes,
please write them down and send them to the following address:

    Moondog of tnb

We need the feedback for  new motivation. Up to now we have received only a few
letters and  this wasn't enough. Because of  this we  had nearly stopped UCM so
get a pen  and write  us if  you want  that Undercover will  be released in the
future...
