Aaaarf! What  the hell  is this?! Not again such  a lame "demo"! I really can't
understand why some guys like I.P.I.R. releasing such a shit!
It can be that they're thinking they were funny but this isn't funny! It's only
lame, lame, LAME! I've seen many lame  demos and intros and  dentros and slides
in the last years, but even the totally lame try of the Senior Dads at the last
Fried Bits was still funnier than this ugly piece of bullshit!
Sometimes  I had tought that no one can beat the Germs in lameness but I was so
wrong! The  ugly Basic- and  DCK-demos of  this guys  were nearly  wonderful in
comparison with this stuff...
Ok, there will  be ever some  guys which will  release such brainless stuff but
I think  if we, the guys which are working  hard to realise a demo with niveau,
will nothing say to  this digital dung  the guys behind this labels (like IPIR,
Yoghurt or Senior Dads) will not stop to torment us with their dull productions
and useless rubbish!
So guys, yes IPIR! Are you able to do only a tiny little effect?! Just a raster
line or a simple  sprite, so send this piece of work to our address! Or are you
really too lame to realise the simplest effex on the good old ST?!
We're waiting for your stuff!!!
