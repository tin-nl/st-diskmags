group    : MJJ Prod / France
system   : Falcon 030, 4 MB RAM, TV / RGB-monitor
released : for the 96K-competition at the Place 2 Be 4
credits  : coding - Joker of MJJ Prod
           musix  - Tao of Cream

As I have seen this little demo I was very surprised because  since 2 years not
the littlest screen was released by MJJ on the Falcon.
Now they're back with a homage to the Bound-demos of Crac.
Bound 42 starts  with burning  dots and one of Tao's new  Sid-musix. This  dots
building several logos on the screen before leaving.
The next effect is also known, it's a texture-tunnel, nice... but you know.
Then you  can see a  little french (grml...) scroller  in the right down corner
and an ifs-fractal was build up on the screen.
Now I  wasn't safe, but  I think this  is bump-mapping. You can  see a textured
round face jumping up and down on the screen and  a lightspot rotates over this
and shows all the structures of the face. This is the best effect of the demo.
The last one is a big gouraud-shaded torus.
After this demo suddenly breaks... finito...
It's a  nice 96K-demo. There were  some shitty things  in this "class" released
(remember  to the Symposium '96) this  year but  this screen  shows again (like
the screens from the GigaFun '96) what you can do with only 96K...
Conclusion: you should take a look at this little thing and get it...
