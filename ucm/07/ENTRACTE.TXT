This is one of the  first releases I've got  from this party. (Thanx to Mike of
Stax!) It's only 100 KB big but brings some neat effects... At first a very big
filled polygon-ball is rolling over the screen and besides a nice tracker-music
plays an intro-logo appears. After this is following a screen with the good old
MODE7-landscape with the greetings on it. Then a screen with divers Z-buffering
objects comes up. At first a banana is drilling in an  apple and in the 2 other
screens some geometric objects are diving into one another.
Now you can see a  wonderfull  picture  by Flan (he has made the first place at
the  grafix-competition with it), followed  by some  very abstract, complex and
fast  phong-vector-objects. These are  the best I  have seen  up to now  on the
Falcon, even if the objects in the GERANIUM-demo are a bit more complex.
At last there comes an endscroller with the credits and so one.
I must mention that all effects and routs are using the DSP...
All in one it's a very good  dentro with  decent design  which you  must get if
you're collecting F030-demostuff...
At last I must mention  that this  demo has won  the 96K-competition against PC
and also Amiga-stuff...
