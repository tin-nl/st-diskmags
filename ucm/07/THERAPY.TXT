            THERAPY-INTRO
           ---------------{*f0

group   : Therapy / Germany
what    : 96 K intro
system  : Falcon with RGB-monitor
release : GigaFun 96 party - July/August
credits : coding - Dodger of Therapy
          musix  - Tesko

This tiny intro isn't very complex. At first the little tracker-music starts to
play and some short text  informs very scarce about  this little thingie. After
this a shaded rotation-zoomer apears on the screen.
The second and also  last effect of this 75kb-intro  brings a new effect to the
Falcon: realtime-bumpmapping. This  looks like a  lightspot is wandering over a
structured area. I can't describe  this effect but it looks very  good, even if
I had seen this  effect on several  Amiga 1200 demos before (with  not only one
lightspot... On the Amiga I've seen up to 5 lightspots but I don't know if this
was also realtime...)
This was all. The intro  don't show heavy design. The only thing which makes it
lookable is the bumpmap-effect. If you want to see only massive and big coding-
spectacles you can't found something on this little screen...
