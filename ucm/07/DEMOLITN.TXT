This demo was the  winner at the  Aggressive Party 2  demo-competition and also
one of the biggest (harddiskspace) Falcon-demos ever made.
It starts with some crude  samples and  a techno-soundtrack (a nice one) starts
to play. Besides some little interlace-logos were shown.
The show begins  with some fast filled vectors. Then  a lady-picture appears on
the screen and a transparent vector-area is flying above it.
At next a nice looking  dots-tunnel is  coming up, but this time  its a checked
one with  something like  a marmor-effect... I know, it  sounds a  bit sick but
I don't know, how I could explain this.
After this follows a transparent coke-rotozoom with another lady-picture in the
background, looks nice but they will do it much better...
Then some 1plane-grafix are  following fast one after another, like in the good
old Grotesque. I think this is the worst part of this  demo! It looks outdated!
The next  effect is much  better, melt-o-vision with  different pictures in it,
but I don't know what the naked woman-picture between this should be...
Then another fire-effect, this time used as message-area is coming up, nice but
always seen before...
After some shaded artwork the coke-rotozoom comes back and this time distorted.
Cool, even if this effect (Ok, but not transparent...) isn't new.
After some logo's the demo suddenly breaks... Huh! Why the hell is this demo so
fucking big?! Is this fake or  what?! There aren't many grafix in it and so the
the only thing which can fill up this 6 MB file will be the soundtrack...
The demo isn't bad but it's not outstanding. There isn't much design, the sound
is cool, in my  opinion, but  the rest is only mediocre. There are  much better
demos  around, which aren't so big  and so  only the  demo-collectors will save
this thing on their harddisx. The others will delete it fastly because 6 MB for
only a handfull of effects are absolutely too much...
