        HIT'N'RUN BBS IS GONE
       ----------------------- {*f0

Hum .. here a  quick message for  all of you who where calling HiT & RuN BBS in
holland. The WHQ of Elite is down for good.

Reason why this  started was problems with the PC i was running it on, it seems
to be fucked  up somewhere.., anyway since i have  little time for  keeping the
bbs in check , i decided to quit the whole thing.

Never thought i  would do a thing  like this, after running this bbs for a non-
stop period of over 5 years..

ELITE as a group isnt death.. the other members are re-grouping as we speak but
it wont be directed by me no longer.

13 years of Piracy have come pretty much to an end now.. no more fame and glory
..oh well..

Quick message towards Aggession:

HYPOCRITS?? I think  so, you knew  somebody would  crack your game sometime. We
even waited for  more then a month... I wonder if all the programs you used, to
code and  design this  game, were  originally  purchased? And  sources  tell me
several  members have hacked  several programs  as well, so why try to blaim us
for this? Your  financial  messe is your  end of the stick.. The software house
has fucked you guyz over, not us! Think about that for a change!
Dumb M.F'ers.. this kind of attitude suxx.. So bitch-slaps to all of ya..!

Anyway bye bye to all who know me and who i had good time with at parties!
Or maybe see you on IRC #elite on Internet.
