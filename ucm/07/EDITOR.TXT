At first  a big sorry for  the late release. I know, we  had planned to release
this issue at  the end of October  this year but because of  some problems with
the code we must postpone the release-date for some weeks...
Please believe  me, I was  very frustrated as  I had heard that Drizzt had some
problems  with the mouse-routines  around the 20.10.... because  I had expected
with the promised release-date... But  now the problems are history and you can
enter the new world of UNDERCOVER...

Hello and welcome to the newest issue of the UNDERCOVER MAGAZINE!

Hey, what?! Yes, you're right! This is issue seven, the first undead one of our
good old  magazine. After  issue 6 we  would stop  this magazine because of the
lack of feedback and support. But now we're back, with a new concept, new dzign
and mainly new motivation!
The first big change you can see here is  the total renewed design and also the
english language  of many articles. The last point was very  important becoz so
we can entertain the Atari-users all over Europe and  not only the german users
(Or should I say loosers?!)...
Why "the german loosers" would  you ask?! It's very simple. In the last 3 years
we had released 6 issues with masses of articles (nearly 4 MB!) but we  haven't
received much feedback (only a handfull of letters of guys which  aren't contax
of us...) and only a few guys had helped us to fill the single issues. The  mag
was spreaded over the Internet and per snailmail and also over the Transmission
CD-ROM, it was introduced in the ST-Computer (a german Atari-magazine) and some
disk-magazines but it was very frustrating to get nearly no feedback or letters
of interested users.
It looks as the whole german scene had ignored our work...
Now we've  started the  second try  and we hope  to get more attention and help
from you. So if you want to help us, just write some articles, Atari-related or
not (craptalk, book/movie/music-reviews, coding-hints & listings  and  more, if
you think you must write about  problems of this world  just get your  keyboard
and write it down! We'll accept nearly all articles and texts!).
After  three years of  writing  we can't stop over night. This is one point for
continuing this magazine. Another point is that some other mags were stopped.
For this  UNDERCOVER VII is  more scene-related as earlier issues. We'll try to
take over the  job of EOS (one of the last (ST)scene-related  mags) which isn't
released since over one year anymore... I don't know if  EOS is still alive and
also the good old DBA magazine and the oldest mag on the ST, ST News by Richard
Karsmakers, were  stopped (I've heard some rumors). If we  had stopped UCM  the
Atari-scene would lose 4 mags in only one year... So we will go on to make your
world a bit  more colourfull.
I know, some of the software  we have tested here was already reviewed in other
magazines, but who cares. Because of the late release we  can bring you over 20
demo-reviews for Falcon and ST, about 20 game-reviews and several utility-tests
and many many more. Up to now some rubrics are filled only with german articles
but I hope to receive  more english articles for the next issue, we hope you'll
like it anyway. The problem  at this time is that the other guys in .tnb. would
not write in english or haven't written any articles (even if they have told me
that  they will  help me) and so I (Moondog) had  worked nearly  allone  on the
contents and had started to work on it before UNDERCOVER VI was released...
I'll hope that they will change their mind in the  future because I haven't the
motivation to fill  this magazine  only with texts by  my own. Ok, I must thank
Drizzt that he had coded the new shell. This is a big progress, because of this
new shell we can release  the mags much faster because it isn't such complicate
like the old one. Some of you might say  that the new shell is a  big step back
but I  think we must  change the complete  concept, no half things and only for
entertaining the readers the new shell  is ok. The new shell  will be developed
much more because  the version for  this mag was coded  in a hurry and isn't in
the final state. For this the time was too short. But I think the main thing is
that Undercover is back on the scene. It was a lot of hard work, I had to fight
against  the guys in .tnb. which wouldn't  release another  issue of our really
(un)famous maggie...
Ok, if you  think this  magazine is worth to be  continued so please help us to
make the cloudy Atari-life much more colorfull! We all knew that the Falcon and
ST-computersystems  are  nearly dead... But  the scene is still alive and so we
should try to keep the scene-life going on.
Ok, this  is all for  now! Read this maggie! And  if you have  any suggestions,
criticism or something else don't hesitate to write us a long letter...

                         that's all for now, may the Knuffeltier be with you...
