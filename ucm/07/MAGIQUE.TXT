This (very) little STE-demo (or better intro) was released for the Aggressive 2
Party (in  March this  year, indeed). It has made  the last place  in the demo-
competition against Falcon- and PC-demos.
So, there isn't much  to see because it's only 120 KB big.
At first a Magique-logo appears on the screen, it isn't brainblasting but looks
quite nice. At the same time a sample-sound starts to play, it's not a module I
think, sounds like a looped sample but it's ok, too.
Then you may see a full-screen-rotating-zoom in 4 planes on the screen and even
if the resolution is a bit coarse this effect is quite good.
After this follows a picture, but it's only mediocre.
Now  it's  time  for a  dots-flag with  the Atari-logo  wobbling  around on the
screen.
The final effect is a Starwars-scroller with a rotating starfield.
Hum! I think  you've already seen all the effex  before but I think it was very
courageous  to enter into a competition against Falcon  and  PC with a STE-demo
and so it was also predictable that it has any chance against the others.
Because there  isn't much  new stuff  around for the old machines, the guys who
are collecting demos or even watch them should get  this little thingie even if
its only mediocre. I'll hope to see more from Wildfire... ST/E rulez forever!!!
