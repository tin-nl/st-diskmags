          WOTANOID - PREVIEW
       ------------------------{*f0

group   : Wotan Extremist Group / France
genre   : shot'em'up
players : 1-2
system  : Falcon with 4 MB RAM, RGB-monitor/TV, 1 MB of harddiskspace, joystick
status  : preview of a forthcoming shareware-game

Wotanoid is another shot'em'up in the  footprints of  Asteroids or Stardust but
this time its done only for the Falcon.
I've only the preview-version  and here you  can play only one scenario and you
have only one life, no highscore and so one.
The game starts without any title-screen and you're immediately in the options-
screen. Here you  can adjust many  things on the sound (FX-samples, background-
music - you can chose one of two modules), you  can select the player-modes and
and the gravity and sometimes also the scenario...
Ok, after starting the  game itself you  can see  a big picture in many colors,
in the background and I think  its truecolor. The sprites  are rendered I think
and they're flipping very fast over the screen.
The control of your fighter over the stick is  a bit tricky but if you're a fan
of this game-genre you will match it surely.
What should I say. On the  first look this game will be a shareware-hit if it's
finaly released. It uses the  capabilities of  the Falcon, brings  module-sound
and also heavy FX-samples, it's fast and colourfull and is also playable...
What do you want more from a shareware-shooter?!
Watch out for the final version which must be released when you're reading this
lines here...
