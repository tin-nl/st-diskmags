         HOW TO DESIGN A DEMO
       ------------------------ {*f0

You all know  the problems on the Atari ST or Falcon... Even if  the demo-effex
aren't bad (sometimes also really  brainblasting) the demos suffer under a lack
of design... Everytime you  can see the same  boring black  backgrounds and the
same  style: an effect before a  simple background, nothing  else... no  little
grafix, shitty colors... arf...
I think the times are over to count dots  or bobs! We need demos  which are not
only interesting for coders... demos should entertain  the guy in front of your
monitor and this can't be realized by counting dots, planes or even stars...
For this I've taken out an article of the Amiga-diskmag R.A.W. by the wellknown
SPACEBALLS... Damn! Would  you cry! Amigaaargh... but open your eyes! The demos
on this machine are  very good designed! Even on the old  Amiga 500 you can see
better  design as on the Falcon, although  this machine must have the power for
some little things more on the screen...
Ok, read now what Mount of Parasite has written...

This article  is not a  manual to  design your  demo(s) since  most people have
different  taste. It's a description  of the different types of design and four
important things you should think about when making your demo.
 {*f1
             The Colours {*f0

is probably  what people think when  you say  design. There  are no real golden
rules but when people think about the choice of colours they  mostly choose one
of the following types: RGB - the good (?) old  which in  my opinion  mostly is
caused by lazy and stubborn coders. The RGB colours have been used so much that
you sometimes really wonder when seeing then  colours again: Why only use about
50 of all those 4096 wonderful colours??? Still a lot of people  use 000, plain
stupid  black, as  background. Why  not just  try a 012, 013 or 023 and explore
that difference can be very refreshing?
KYD-BALLE more or less shocked  the world with  their design in HARDWIRED. Some
blue  but  mostly greyish  colours  which made  a very  special atmosphere  and
shortly afterwards got very popular.
POP colours are the direct contrast to KYD-BALLE design where you use pure blue
or purple background and in general colours which might look a bit sugar sweet.
One of the best examples are ANARCHY's LEGALIZE IT.
MELON DEZIGN introduced  their own design with HUMAN TARGET, intros for CRYSTAL
and later SOS. most of the colours are very happy (some would say childish) and
some pastel colours but often still very colourfull.
ANDROMEDA have with their last productions established their own kind of dsign.
Not as innovating as MELON, you could say a mixture of KYD-BALLE and POP so you
get these very consistent pastel colours.
No matter what colours you use, it's very  important to try to keep them in the
same style through the whole demo.
 {*f1
             Composition {*f0

is something people have been more aware of lately, again more or less starting
with HARDWIRED. It's  all about  making the routines  more or less overlap each
other so you don't feel any breaks while watching.
If you can  even time the music with the routines it  can give a  very stunning
effect  like  in  SANITY's  WORLD  OF  COMMODORE. The  probably  best  composed
production  is  MIRROR  by ANDROMEDA where  things  as  simple as a module info
suddenly turns into art.
 {*f1
                Speed {*f0

A lot  of demoproducers forget a golden  rule: never let  the viewer get bored.
There is  nothing more  frustratin g than sitting and have  to wait long (maybe
without having  the chance  to click and continue) before a booring  routine is
over. I would even say than you can get bored of watching even cool routines.
To impress people you have to slam routines into their faces so they maybe even
want to see the demo once more.
Some rather normal routines shouldn't be on the screen for more than 5 seconds,
nearly none  for more than 10. Actually  you can often improve a demo when just
making it last half as long.
I would  even say that you should sometimes consider removing 1/2 or 1/3 of the
routines just to show only what's interesting.
Also be careful writing too much text in the middle of the demo - that can wait
till the end.
And maybe you should think about your  language too - Don't write that you will
now show a cool routine. Let people decide on their own!
 {*f1
             Homogeneousy {*f0

It's one  of the smaller  things which are harder to explain. One part of it is
the before mentioned that you shouldn't mix different types of colours.
But there are also different  types of graphics and routines which shouldn't be
mixed up. Who would like a dragon in the middle of HARDWIRED, eh?
As an  actual example  I will attack  the HUMAN TARGET because the plane in the
end of the demo really doesn't fit at all! As said before the graphics must fit
the demo  well  no matter  how simple  it is. You could  even say that graphics
basicly isn't needed at all when the routines are only good enough!

Remember that it can be worth it to  use some time to  design. Through the last
1-2 years  there have  been seen  several  productions which people  liked more
because of the  design than the code  etc. and on the other hand some very good
coded  demos didn't  get the attention  they deserved because of lack of design
(no names mentioned.....).

        GO FOR IT AND MAKE YOUR PRODUCTIONS AS ATTRACTIVE AS POSSIBLE!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thats it! Hum, some of  you surely don't know the demos which were mentioned in
this article but I would  only say that this  demos are something like state of
the art on the Amiga 500... At least  HARDWIRED has the same cultstate like the
good old "Ooh Crickey..." on the ST.
Some of  you have surely  scratched themselves  on the head after reading this,
because of the Atari-typical  failures like  black backgrounds (which were also
used on  the Falcon, today!) or  demoeffex which  were showed  for minutes  and
hours...
Some demos on the ST or Falcon are very well done. Only remember to the FLIP-O,
which is the state of the art on the ST with great effex and which is also very
well designed, even if this demo looks like a rippoff of several amiga-demos.
On the Falcon there  are some nice  designed demos like the new ENTRACTE or the
ENRAGED by AVENA... But the most demos on the Falcon still suffer under the old
fashioned styling. At example the OBNOXIOUS... The demo brings very great effex
and the  design is  ok, but the routines are  shown to long  on the screen. The
same  problem appears on the  good old  MOSTLY HARMLESS, very good  effex but a
totally outdated "design"... I could continue this (GERANIUM, HDX SYMPOSIUM...)
but I'm too tired...
Ok, even  if you're thinking  it is lame to "convert" Amiga-design to the ST or
Falcon think  about the text above and try to give your  productions a bit more
design... so we  can go proud to  multi-system-parties and we can show demos to
the others without being laughed at...
