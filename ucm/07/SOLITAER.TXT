This is an older game but I had received  it before some  days. I think you all
know this game. You've a playfield in  form of a cross  and  on this  field are
laying many little balls. You have to remove all balls by jumping with one over
another one. If you have all balls except on in the middle of the field removed
or you can't jump over another ball the game is over. Ok, this sounds very easy
but it isn't. There are many possibilities to remove the single balls.
Ok, the game  itself is  presented in  raytracing  and I think  such a game you
can't show better. BUT: there is no sound, not a little beep or so! This is big
shit! Even the Falcon has the best capabilities to use music or FX in a game or
something like that... It's a shame...
Also the  control over  mouse and keyboard is  very crappy. Sometimes the balls
can't be moved even if it must go. I don't know why...
The registration-fee is totally overdrawn because you'll get only save and load
options for your games.
By the way, this game is coded in Omikron.Basic... Arf...
The result: This is a game for the ton! Delete it as fast as possible or is the
harddisk  in your  machine a  sewage works  where you collect  the biggest shit
ever?! Hopefully not... Think on my words...
