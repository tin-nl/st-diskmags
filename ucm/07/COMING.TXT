          COMING PRODUCTIONS
         -------------------- {*f0

.tnb. is on the  road again and we're working on several projects. Ok, what you
shouldn't miss in the next few months...

LASSE REINB™NG

The  demo of the  decade! If you want to see some brainblasting effex and  cool
design (read  the article in this magazine) on your ST, order it now! Send just
a  disk and return-postage to one of the adds in this magazine.
The demo will be out around Xmas 1996... and it will be also Falcon-compatible.

(That's a lie. This demo won't see the lights before spring '97...)


WHEN HIFIDREAMS BECOME REALITY 2

Yawn! After  nearly 3 years we  will release a successor  to this legendary (?)
music-disk. This time it isn't save if the  demo will  run also on a simple STF
and we don't know how many disx it will  fill (We have about 4 MB of modules of
Lot, FXL and the  guest-musician Corni  of the legendary QFT-soundconnexion and
the Bad Sectors / Amiga) but we will release it sometimes... Just wait...

...

and much more in 1997...

I wouldn't  tell something about projects which aren't started up to now but we
will release more demos and also new issues of UNDERCOVER in the next year!

                           So stay tuned!
