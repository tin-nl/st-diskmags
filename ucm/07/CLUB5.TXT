Yet another  music-demo from  Kuba with lotsa  techno and house trax. This demo
was released in autumn last year in the UK. The musix are in part very cool but
sounding a bit  dirty on a simple STF. It's sad that these  sounds aren't saved
as mod-file  or so on the disk to  replay them on a Falcon or an STE...
The grafix are simple but ok, the music  is much more  important then a font or
logo, at least in a music-demo... I think so...
The sounds  reaching from jungle over ambient to techno  and house. The modules
were well done but read  above, the  khz-rate on  the replay is very low and so
it sounds a bit  crude and dirty and this shorts the time you'll hear the songs
very fast... Erm, I knew it was bullshit what I had written yet but who cares?
Ok, if you've  a ST or STE and you like techno-musix you should get this little
demo, it's worth a look, even  if no stunning  effex or great grafix are shown,
but it's only a music-disc...
