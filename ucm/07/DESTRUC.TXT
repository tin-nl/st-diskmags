Yeah! I can't believe it! The  best at first: DESTRUCTION IMMINENT is game like
WOLFENSTEIN 3D for the ST! You'll say that SUBSTATION is also a game like this,
but D.I. features  texturemapping, even  if the textures  are a bit simple, and
the game isn't very slow...
The story behind the game is always  the same. You're the good one and you must
escape out of a prison-complex. You have a weapon and must fight against divers
robots, mutants  and monsters, and  this also against a time-limit. Not more to
say. You can collect  several weapons  and medi-kits. You  must collect keys to
get some doors open and you can find hidden rooms like always.
You can also  get a map  and a radar, which  makes your way through the complex
much easier.
That's for the game-plot...
The technical side  looks good. I  wouldn't say  that it is  brainblasting, but
its quite good. Ok, if you have played games like WOLFENSTEIN 3D or DOOM you'll
laugh about the grafix  but what will you  do with only 16 colors? The textures
are very simple but  therefore also shaded. The enemies are bitmap-grafix which
are also  shaded but not animated. The  game is a  bit slower as SUBSTATION but
therefore it runs also on a simple ST...
The sound is ok. You can hear a 16 Khz-Digisoundtrack in the screens before and
after the level. In the  level itself are some sampled sounds  and also speech-
samples and something like soundchip-effects.
The control is ok. You can use the  keyboard only or the joystick with the keys
for selecting weapons and so one.
The final game will feature 25 levels with  password-system and something more.
This game is very promising and I hope to see the  final version soon. It shows
that also the ST can do 1st-view-massacre-games. Ok, this one isn't very bloody
and horrible but for this its very cheap! Get it if you like games like this!
