So, here it is! The final version of BFOS! I think some of you will remember to
the Fried Bits 3, where  Impulse had released a little (shitty) preview of this
demo. At that  time this  demo was  only a  ordinary slideshow  with some  IFS-
fractales and nothing more.
Now, over one year after this, the demo was finally released and it looks a bit
better, I think.
The demo  starts with  a little menu  with the usual options like speaker on or
off... After this a sample was played but absolutely too fast! You can't under-
stand it. Besides this a little comet smashes into a landscape-picture...
A rendered Impulse-logo is coming  up and after a very crude BFOS-logo the show
begins with a starfield and some text. Also a module-music starts to play.
A rendered radioactive-logo appears in the right  top corner  and a toilet made
of filled vectors is  turning around  on the screen. Some other vectors, filled
and also line-vectors are following. I must say that this vector-objects aren't
state of the art, even an  Atari ST is able to bring  such vector-objects, just
look at the Holocaust-demos (Japtro, Rising Force & Blood).
After this follows a fire-effect, always seen before and also much better!
Now you can see another rendered picture  on the screen and a textured 3D-globe
with all the continents is rotating on the screen, looks nice...
The next  effect, after some  other  pixelgrafix, is  a rotating-zoom  with two
different grafix in it.
And again you can see  another rendered picture. After this you can see a compi
with mouse and monitor, I think  it's an Atari (hehehe), made of filled vectors
turning around on  the screen. At the  moni you can see a rotating colorcycling
plasma...
There are more filled vectors coming up, followed by an rendered swedish flagg.
After this the screen was blue, the musax was playing and nothing more happened
and so I think this demo is over...
Hum. Ok, the demo is now a bit better then the old one and it had won the compo
at the NAS 96 but I would  say this demo  is boring. You  can't see extravagant
effects and nice design. The musix isn't exciting and the  grafix aren't great.
Ok, the rendered pix are mostly nice looking, but I prefer handmade stuff...
For the  demo-consumer: get  it, watch  it and  just delete it... only the ones
who're collecting demos will save this thing on their harddisx...
Sorry, but in the year of 1996 you must  present much more stuff to impress the
demo-watchers...
