               The Atari Undergound - or what's left of it!
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               
                                   by
  
                  MC LASER of The Sirius Cybernetics Corp.
                  

So here we are. It's the year 1996. The Atari scene is almost dead... but there
are still survivors! Survivors on the legal and the illegal side.

The  Bladerunners (42-Crew, STCS), The Union (TEX, The Replicants, Howdy, Delta
Force), Superior, D-Bug, Automation, Flame  of Finland, Delight, Empire, Pompey
Pirates, Cynix, Medway  Boys, BBC, The  Scottish  Cracking Crew, Alien Cracking
Formation, Ford Perfect, International Cracking Service, Copy Service Stuttgart
(also known for many Atari 800 XL activities), Bad  Boys Belgium, Bastards Int.
... That were all names of piracy fame on the Atari ST/E (not on Falcon because
most of the  groups stopped  before the  Falcon was released and there were not
many games for the 030!)

Now let us look what's left today...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

First there is, for me, the cracking crew number 1 called VECTRONIX!

They consist of:  Metallinos (Cracker)
                  Moonfall   (Coder, Gfx man)
                  Twilight   (Coder)
                  Slippy 
                  Ice Tea    [Ex-Hardcore]
                  Hardball   (Sysop VEX WHQ)
                  Lonsdale   [Ex Skinhead of I.C.S.]
                  Phoenix    (Sysop VEX Scandinavian HQ, Cracker)
                  Jabba      (Cracker) [Ex-Superior]

Comment: Their  cracks are  carefully checked  and work  mostly perfect!!! They
also do lots  of Falcon fixes  of games and  other programmes. In the last time
they released  many old  games, filed  and fixed  to work on  the Falcon. Since
Jabba joined them they are now as double as good as before! 
Their slogan  for 1996 is  called  PIRATES UNITED and they say that there is no
place for a crew call themself Nr. 1. - Competition is over.
They are the only crew I know who reassemble a whole source code from a game to
fix bugs and improve the whole game (I mean Civilisation!).

Second one is ELiTE. All the members from the beginning left this crew sometime
ago. Also SLEDGE who was  the famous leader of the posse stopped on Atari after
his BBS 'Hit'n Run' broke down. I have  been told that he  is now only cracking
on consoles (ELITENDO is alive!).

They consist of:  doctor byte            italy      trader
                  ex                     belgium    musician
                  faramir                belgium    sysop       [Ex-ZUUL]
                  marcer                 sweden     sysop     [Ex-Legion]
                  mr no                  france     sysop      
                  nikademus              belgium    coder       [Ex-ZUUL]
                  pervert                poland     hacker
                  scorpio                france     serial killer
                  static                 france     cracker
                  stratagem              germany    sysop          [A.M.]
                  the attacking shark    germany    trader    [Ex-I.C.S.]
                  who cares              poland     phreaker

Comment: Most  of the  things they  done  lately  were  keymakers  for  several
Shareware  programmes or  utilities. Most  of  the crackwork  is done  only  by
2 people: Scorpio and Static. The  last remarkable  release was the megatrained
version of Super Stario Lands.

UPDATE: Faramir left the ST Scene and Stratagem took over the leadership.

So the most active group are now mentioned. There's a little bit more:

Third  there is  still  SUPREMACY! First  off  all, the name  has  changed into
SUPREMACY CORP. This Crew is composed of 4 departments:

- Bad Boys               (illegal section on PC)
- Dreams Land            (illegal section on MAC, ST and Falcon)
- Dark Developments      (legal section on ST and Falcon)
- Typhoon Department     (legal section on ST and Falcon)

Another illegal  section will  be  created  which will be for cracked games for
Saturn, SNES, Playstation, Megadrive... Consoles in general.

Known members are: Razaac, Sanshiro, Artek and all from Typhoon.

Comment: Nothing new  seen from the crew lately on the illegal side. But I have
been told that they are still alive. Last remarkable release was a preview of a
conversion of CANNON FODDER 2 by Corpo. Nobody  knows if the  game will ever be
finished because  Corpo (the coder  of the conversion) left the crew and joined
ATROCITY.

We come to the fourth EUROSWAP (composed by PASSWORDS and EXO 7):

Some members are: Skywalker
                  Laurenzo
                  Achernar
                  Sademan
                  Doctor X
                  Zastaph
  
Comment: Also it's  very quit  around this  crew. Maybe  they are  dead. Nobody
knows anything. The  last releases  I have seen  was CD 933  and a  cooperation
between Passwords and ELiTE called 'Hollywood Hustler'. 

UPDATE: Latest news tell that they are now mainly on AMIGA...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -


The fifth group I want to count is INTERNATIONAL CRACKING SERVICE (I.C.S.).

I know they  are almost  dead! I only  count them  because Skinhead (Now called
Lonsdale of VEX) has released a Pirate CD ROM under that label.

From the decent cracking crews to the decent compilation crews active today:

There is  no real  quality  group  like 'Pompey Pirates' left on  here. Most of
those crew use stolen source code for their intros. Lame on the coding side!



Let's start off with the BRAINDEAD BROTHERS (i think they come from UK):

Nice Menus. Always  some exclusive  stuff. For example their was a full version
of HOOG on one menu. The intro  GFX are original but the  intro code  and musix
are ripped!



We go on with the ANCIENT CELTS (located in Ireland):

Also  good  menus. This  crew  is  trying  to  confuse  the  scene by releasing
unregular numbers of  their compilations. Their  first menu  was #69. Then came
#72 and then they went on in a normal state. But guess what, Yes, ripped intro-
code. I'm sorry but that's soooooooo lame!



Alright we come to PURE ENERGY (located in UK):

Brilliant menus. The  best group there  is... One of best groups there was! I'm
sure they are  dead because no new releases were seen for over 1 year now. Last
game menu was #86. No  ripped code. Always  original graphics and also original
musix! 



Let's go a bit further to TUMULT (located in Germany):

Cool menus. But  some stuff is useless  on there because its PD. But they get a
plus because their intros are always original code! Promising!



Another new crew on this scene is called PULSE (located in UK):

They  have released  some utility  menus. But  I'm tired  of saying  it: ripped
introcode. Arrgh! Could  it go lamer or not? (Sorry Outcast, but code something
on your  own! Your  menus are not  that bad  but only  if you notice that code-
ripping is  lame and start to code your own intros, then you'll get the respect
from the scene!).



Finally we come to the  end of this article. But why have  I written this piece
of  informative  stuff? I  can't describe  the  reason. I  got a Brainwave  and
started to write  and here's the  result. I don't  know if all the informations
are  right. I  apologise  to all  crews if  my informations  are  wrong! Please
contact me and correct me! Also contact me when I have forgotten your group.
