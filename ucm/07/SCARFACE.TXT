This is one  of the biggest demos which was released on the Place 2 Be 4 party,
and in quality and quantity it has a good standard.
You  can  surely remember  their  first  demo, called "Never Mind The Bollocks"
which  was also  very good for a first demo and now their back with some better
stuff...
The demo  starts with some  nice drawn logos and a rock-music  with guitars and
hammond-organs (at least it sounds like this) and you can see a little gouraud-
shaded spaceship flyin' around in a starfield on your screen.
At next coming some more gouraud-vectors and after a  strange picture  also the
credits for the demo.
And more  vectors are  coming up. This time on their sides you can see  zooming
and disting textures. After another cool logo  you can see some  phong-shading-
objects. The best thing is a teapot, nice.
After another logo and a strange grouraud-vector the demo breaks.
Now you  can hear  a great heavy-metal-sound  with a cool  guitar-solo. I think
this  isn't a  simple module  anymore. It sounds more like a  sample, but  it's
really great.
Besides this you can see different grouraud-shading-vectors, also as rgb-vex.
The last effect is a cool distorting and antialiased roto-zoom.
The very last thing is the usual end-scroller with credits and so one...
That's all. Ok, the most effex are old but the demo wins some points because of
the cool  sound. The grafix are mostly  nice  drawn. The design  could be  much
better... Ok, I  think all  Falcon-owners with a  faible for  demos  should get
this demo, it's one of the better big demos this year.
