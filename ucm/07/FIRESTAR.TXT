Uups! This is the first big production coming from the east. Before some months
I haven't thought that there is a scene in Poland or other countries in eastern
europe. I've heard only something about a little scene  in Hungaria... But than
I've recieved some grafix from a polish party (Orneta '95) and I was surprised.
The grafix  were in part really  cool (for ST...) and  so I was very curious to
the first real productions. The only demo from Poland I  had seen up to now was
a little dentro  for the ST by the  Acid Team, but this one is now over 3 years
old and I have thought that the polish scene isn't very active and productive.
But now I've received this fresh and new demo which was released in autumn this
year...
Ok, the demo starts very old fashioned with the credits. A Shadows-logo appears
on the screen and a  techno-music starts to play. The logo burns away by a very
short fire-effect, ok, always seen before.
At next a rotating-zoom in  fullscreen comes to your screen, followed by a face
which was  manipulated (looks like  morphing or so one...). This effect is nice
looking...
Than a glass-ball comes  up and jumps around  in front of a plasma-picture. The
next effect I can't describe. It looks like a  pseudo-bumpmapping. I don't know
what it should be. This isn't brainblasting, because the resolution is very low
and the colours are, erm... ok, I wouldn't write more about it...
At next burning vectors coming to your screen. This  part looks like the screen
in Inter's Obnoxious, but  only for poor  guys... Ups, I before I  forget it: I
haven't known that fire is green/blue/yellow in Poland ... ;-)
The next effect is also very old, texture-mapping-vectors, followed by a piccie
and the greetings.
At last a gouraud-shaded simple figure of a man was flying around on the screen
and the demo ends abrupt.
Hum. At first you will see that  nearly all of the effex are known and shown in
other demos up to falling  down. The demo  hasn't much design and is completely
old-fashioned, it  looks like older  ST-demos (from the structure)... plain and
stupid  black backgrounds, credits  at first and  so one. The only thing I have
missed was a scroller ;-)
The sound-track is only mediocre and the grafix, hum... they're just acceptable
in my eyes.
All in one it's nice to see that there is a scene in Poland and not only on the
XL or ST, but  this production  is nothing more  as mediocre. The effex are old
and always seen before and there is no part which was worth mentioning...
I hope  that the following  productions have a  higher quality. This demo shows
that there is a motivated and not unskilled in our neighbourstate...
