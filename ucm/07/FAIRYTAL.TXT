   ------------------------------- {*f0

released by : Strange Ways Records 1996
price       : 30 DeutschMark

Do you  ever heard  of this band? No? I also... up to  a day  in the  middle of
October this  year, the "Fairyland?"-tour was  straight at  the end. One  of my
nice colleagues (Hi Eva! Now you're also  mentioned in this cult-magazine...:-)
had a package of cd's brought with one to  our workplace. Besides the very nice
DEINE LAKAIEN album "Winter Fish Testosterone" was also this one in the package
and from the first noises on I liked it!
How I can describe the sound of this album? Hum, it's not  easy. It's a kind of
synthie-pop, like  a  mixture  of  Depeche Mode, Camouflage, O.M.D.  and with a
touch of techno... and it  sounds fantastique! Meanwhile  is this the 4th album
of them and they were handled as the followers of Depeche Mode and Camouflage.
Besides a very decent voice of the  singer the music  sounds not to  overloaded
with synthie-effex and you can dance  the whole night to this album! I must say
that nearly all songs on this album are very well done. I can't remember nearly
no other piece of work which was such good from the first to the last song!
Ok, now the contains...

01. I Regret
02. Dawn
03. Sweet Life
04. Like The Sun
05. Harvester
06. Today's Life
07. Scars
08. Keep Your Dreams Alive
09. Wares Of Sin
10. Bleed Me White
11. Take Me To The Time
12. Daydreamin'

You can hear many fast songs and also some ballads and they all are living from
the great  voice of the singer  and the cool synthie-sounds... I can't describe
this! You must go to your music-shop and take a "hear" on this album! It's real
worth the way! (And don't forget to get some money before going in the shop...)
Before I  change to the  song-text-department I  would tell which  are the best
songs on this  album (in my  opinion ofcourse)... If you'll go to a record-shop
to test  it just hear to this ones: "I Regret", "Harvester", "Scars", "Bleed Me
White" and "Take Me To The Time", but the others are also very good...
Ok, at last the song-texts...

I Regret
--------

Sometimes I'm simple minded
Then I can't read your look
All my thoughts are binded
I'm like an opened book
In which you read the story
Of a bleeding soul
I am so sorry
Each time I lose control.

I should suppress my rage
I need you beside me
Don't you leave the stage
I need you to guide me
I know you'll be my saviour
If I repeat my fault
You put me on my best behaviour
You hear my call.

Please hold out
I regret
All the nasty words I said
I can feel you getting colder
Please don't doubt
That I regret
All the days I left you sad
Can't you see me getting older.

I know I hurt your feelings
But you had the strength
To start my healing
You went all lengths
The days of crying
Have reached the end
'cause now I'm trying
To understand.

Please hold out...

Sweet Life
----------

As we were young
We believed in wonder
No shadows on our unfeigned souls
We were so much stronger.

A sweet life
Unrestrained and wild
A sweet life
Glad to be a child
A sweet life
We had no price to pay
A sweet life
Day by day.

As we were young
We ran through the fields
We let things take their course
Had nothings to conceal
As we were young
We could move mountains
Our childlike heart and soul
Were our strengths' fountain.

A sweet life...

Like The Sun
------------

I would die for you
You are my soul support
I don't lie to you
I will take all things you taught
I get high on you
You're the most befooling drug
And I sigh for you
I would never touch your luck.

You don't flee
Keep me in view
You see me
Safely through
When the cold
Hurts my soul
You're like the sun.

Want to fly with you
To a place we don't know
I will cry for you
When the time has come to go.

You don't flee...

Harvester
---------

I cannot trust another vow
Another lie
I won't accept a new deceit
Before my eyes
You poke the flame
Of distrust in me
No matter what you say
You'll pay.

You'll taste the pain
I know
You will harvest what you sow.

I don't pretend to be a saint
I am alive
Nowhere to go
No place I know
You can follow close behind.

You'll taste the pain...

Today's Life
------------

Wrapped in mystery
A witless waste
No sign of dignity
A misty haze
Blood-red history
A deadly fate
Perverse philosophy
Justifying hate.

Life of agony
My mind insane
Nowhere security
And nowhere security
And nowhere shame
A yearn for harmony
No silly game
Spirituality
Penetrate my brain.

Does it help us to pray?
I never felt that way
Does life make sense today?
I never felt that way.

Does it help us to pray?

Scars
-----

I know I came too late
To save your heart
I couldn't change your fate
Now we're torn apart
We were just boys
When you had to go
Each day I miss your voice
And I'm feeling low.

Heal the scars in my soul
Now the time is right
Heal the scars in my soul
Wipe out the shame inside.

And now it's much too late
To save your heart
I suffer from your fate
We're torn apart.

Heal the scars in my soul...

Keep Your Dreams Alive
----------------------

You are searching
For a place to hide
You will find it
In a dream of pure delight
You feel safety
No fear inside your mind
In your dreamland
You leave all pain behind.

Keep dreaming
Keep your dreams alive
Don't stop dreaming
'cause it beautifies your life...

You are waiting
For the rain to fall
Feel the raindrops
After tearing down the wall
You leave sadness
And then you come to bear
Your private paradise
Your dreams will take you there.

Keep dreaming...

Bleed Me White
--------------

I'm afraid of you
When I see your glare
I will go down on my knees
I'd do anything for you
Want to taste all sins
I lick off your feet
I can't get enough
I can never stop the lust.

I keep still now you can bleed me white
If you stay you see my second sight
I keep still now you can bleed me white
You'll discover an undying light.

I play the fool for you
I lay down my pride
I will go down on my knees
I'd do anything for you
You can seal my fate
I give my heart to you
I can't get enough
I can never stop the lust.

I keep still now you can bleed me white...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Take Me To The Time
-------------------

You can pray for me
But you cannot save my soul
Dig my grave but see
That I still can hear you moan
Think of my embrace
When you lose all hope and faith.

You reach out for me
But you cannot grasp a dream
You hold on to me
Your illusion makes me real
Think of my embrace
In your drug's delusive haze.

Take me to the time
Let it start again
Take me to the time
When it all began
We can fly so high
You'll never want to say good-bye.

just remember me
That's the last I do implore
Don't you grieve for me
Never lock your tender door
Think of my embrace
Don't ever trust heaven's grace.

Take me to the time...

Take me to the time...

I never wanted you to die.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Daydream
--------

The wind has called my name
You won't find me down again
Can you hear the same?
Spread your wings and fly away.

With you by my side
No more to say
With no place to hide
We run from today
Whit you by my side
I won't be afraid
Inscrutable night
We seize the day.

My soul they'll never tame
Higher spheres I reached again
Do you feel the same?
Pack your bag and dream away.

With you by my side...

Many thanx to Eva for lending me her CD! Hope to meet you sometimes again...
