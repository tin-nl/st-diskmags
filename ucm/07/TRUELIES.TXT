This very little file-demo I've received in  the last week  and I was surprised
about the name of this band but now I think they haven't nothing to do with the
guys  who  have made some  animation-demos (like Cyberscape, California Raisins
and much more) in the early days of the ST.
I don't know for what and when this demo was released but I think it's relative
new because it's since few weeks in the Gorezone BBS.
Ok, stop this crap. I'll tell you now something about the demo itself.
The file is  only 65 KB big and so I thought there isn't much to see, but I was
so wrong...
The demo starts  with a little  line on the  screen which  says "Sometimes they
come back" but I haven't heard about this group up to now.
After this a rendered Antic-logo appears on the screen. Looks nice but has sick
colors, pink ... erm... then follows a True Lies logo but this uses only an old
and ugly font.
The real show begins  with another  logo and some  mirrored but simple line-vex
and a chip-music  starts to play. The  next effect is also pretty old, a simple
dotssphere. Then the credits were written on the screen.
A picture with the swedish flagg was faded in and a mirrored rotating-zoom with
a very coarse resolution is following. I haven't seen an uglier roto-zoom up to
now on the good old ST! Arf...
After some IFS and normal  fractales (I hate fractales!) three RGB-balls flying
around on the screen, nice but always seen before.
The end-screen contains another logo, a new chipmusic, a starfield and a simple
1-plane-scroll. After this an endlogo comes up... finito...
Hum... The demo isn't state  of the art! Ok, for  only 65 KB there are many efx
but this aren't well done. The grafix  aren't the best  and the musix  are also
wellknown and to much used before. This  is the one side. At  the otherone this
is a sign that some guys are still working on demos for the ST and for this we,
the demo-watchers, should thank these guys, even if the demo is only mediocre.
