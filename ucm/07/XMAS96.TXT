       UNDERCOVER XMAS 96 ISSUE
     ----------------------------{*f0

Hey what?! Yes, we will  eventually release  a special-issue before  Xmas! This
will be an unnumbered issue. Because of the short time we have to release (only
1 and a half month) it will be not such big as this one here.
But we will entertain you over the holidays with fresh and hot stuff...
Ok, what you will read in this little issue...
For the gamblers we will take  a look at the newest stuff  around: a preview on
CANNON FODDER 2 for  the ST and also  RUNNING for the Falcon and hopefully some
more (HEARTLAND, SPACE FIGHTER and so one)...
We hope to  get some  more demos (I don't know if something was released on the
YELLING YAM Party, but  we will see...) and  the first  interviews  with scene-
peoples (most likely we will drag the new german cd-group TUMULT to the keys).
There will be a special Xmas-corner (sorry but only for germans).
Also we will bring the ATARI-FAIR '96 report...
A lot of other things will also be enclosed in this magazine and  so watch out!
We will release this  issue at the latest  at the 20.12.1996  so you can get it
before the holidays.
