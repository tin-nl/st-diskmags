This is the first release by this new french group, which consits of members of
the Megabusters and it's a quite good one.
The demo starts with TV-snow and some noises... You can see a volume-control on
the screen and the demo starts with a very funny tracker-sound and a nice Toons
logo in pixel-style.
There  are following big vector-balls  which were  turning around on the screen
and besides  nice design-effecs  effecs there are coming line-vex and grouraud-
shading-vex.
Than you  can see a nice bunny-picture with a mapped glas-ball and a magnifying
Toons-logo is jumping around in front of the picture.
After this  a big raytraced picture is coming up and  in front of  this you can
see a shaded  glass-vector... Very  nice and  not seen  before, I think, on the
Falcon...
That was all. The demo is a bit short but very nice looking. The design is very
good at the first few screens. The effex aren't brainblasting but even ok.
The music is very crazy! Cool!
This demo is a  very good thing for the first release of a new formed group and
it shows that also the new groups in france are very skilled...
I think you should have this demo, especially if you like mad soundtracks...
