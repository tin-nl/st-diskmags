"What?! Another  simple Pacman-clone  for the Falcon?!" will you  surely ask...
No! I must say! TOYMAN is the contribution of T.O.Y.S. for the demo-competition
of the Nordic Atari Show 1996... and it's a 4096 bytes game!
Yes, TOYMAN is one  of the smallest  games ever done on the Atari, I don't care
if ST or Falcon... At  this time I can  remember to just one game which is much
smaller than TOYMAN, and this  was INVERTIX, a little bootsector-puzzle-game by
Titan of Animal Mine... But TOYMAN is not a boring ASCII-game or something like
that! No, it  contains grafix, tiny  little  sprites  and many  levels, besides
score-counter and the usual things... And also not in only one colour or so...
Ok, because you will  always know  the game  Pacman and I think you have played
the game sometimes on any computer I will not writing more bullshit here...
TOYMAN shows  how many stuff you can pack in only 4 KB. Even if  the grafix are
not brainblasting and there is no sound, but what do you expect from 4 KB?!
I think all of  you have a little  bit place left  on the harddisk to save this
little game...
I will not give any ratings here because I can't do this for a 4 KB-game...

(Delta Force coded a Archon-Clone for ST in 3.5kbyte!!! /drizzt)
