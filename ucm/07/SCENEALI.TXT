"Is the scene  really alive?", that's what I asked  myself some weeks ago. What
do you mean, when  you talk about "the Scene"? Do you mean the Atari-Scene, the
ST and STE Scene, the Falcon Scene or the JAG-Scene???
Is that a  good question or not? I think the major problem of "THE SCENE" today
is the splitting  into thousands  of subscenes! Some  years ago everyone worked
with the same  machine - the ST!
Today there  are  the above mentioned subscenes and everybody is working on his
own. There is no unity anymore - and that's the problem!!!
Look at  the so called  Falcon-scene. Every  4 or 5 months appear 2 or 3 demos,
that's too less to say the scene is alive! Most of the demos are not as good as
some stuff on an AMIGA 500 or 1040 STE!
The Falcon-crews  are laughing about us poor  ST-Users, but is the Falcon-scene
more alive then the ST-Scene??
I don't  think so!!! Now look at  the ST-Scene. All the real  coding-crews left
this machine. They changed to the Falcon or PC or stopped completly.
The last of  the great demos that came out were: Necrosys/HMD, Blood/Holocaust,
Synergy Megademo, Japtro/Holocaust and  Froggies over the Fence by Overlanders,
LEGACY and ST CNX. Most of the stuff that appear are Compilation disks, Module-
compils, game-compils, demo-compils and other compils with other stuff!
Some of them are good, for example EFFECT, THE BLUES BOYS, STAX and GOLDEN DAWN
Menues, but there are a lot of shitty crews who try the same.
They steal the sourcecode from some democrews like POV or PE and use them as an
Intro... how lame... learn to code, then the scene would be more colourful than
today!!!
Many of those compils  include the same stuff, that's a big shit and a waste of
disk space!!! This  is an appeal  to all compil-crews out there you should more
coordinate under  each other, then such things wont happen anymore! It sucks to
have the same demos on 3 or 4 disks!!!
Today we have an COMPILATION OVERKILL!!!!!!!
So I think Im  finished for today. There are still some points to mention but I
can't  remember  them right  now. So please  tell  me your  opinion  about this
article and how you see the things...
