Tankblaster is a game  like Dynabusters or  Men At War. In  an arena up to six
players can battle against each other with their little tanks. The game can be
played in the normal (all against all), in team-mode or in hunt-mode (here you
must hunt  one player). The game isn't such  funny like Dynabusters but it has
some  special  features like  divers  traps. I think  this was all to the game
itself. I'm sure that you have played such an arena-game before and so I would
not write more shit about the gameplay...
Ok, up to six players can be chosen in the menu but I can't activate the sixth
player. The  others are  clear, 2 joysticks, 2 joypads (or STE-sticks) and one
on the keyboard, but the last one?! I don't know.
You can chose many  options in the  mainmenu like  the shotfrequency, the time
for clearing each stage or the shield of a tank.
The grafix aren't  bad and colourful  enough for a Falcon-game but the sprites
are absolutely to little and when more players are battling against each other
you'll need a big TV-screen or at  least a 15"-monitor because not all players
can sit directly in front of the screen.
The control of the tanks is a bit tricky because you  can't only turn the tank
itself, no, also the canons can be turned and in the heat of the combat it can
be that you're firing for the walls instead of your enemies.
Ok, the soundtrack isn't bad but very short and there are no FX in the game.
The registration-fee is suitable I think because the 15 levels in this version
are fastly finished. The final  version (the  tested is  only a  demo) will be
containing more musix (8 channels) and some other stuff.
The only  thing you  need to play  this game is  a bunch of friends which will
fight against you...
