In this  game you must  build a route between some points. Over this route must
roll a ball  after finishing  the building. You have several tiles to close the
gaps  between the  present tiles. Ok, sounds  easy but it  isn't. You must play
against a  time-limit and  also in lower levels  the solution is sometimes very
difficult. So this isn't a game for the lunch break.
The techninal  realizing  isn't state  of the art, even  if the game isn't very
expensive. The grafix aren't very impressive and sometimes a bit ridiculous.
Also the sound is nothing more than mediocre. In the screens between the single
levels there are some sampled voices, which  should be female but they sounding
very deep and so you can only laugh about this  try to enclose more as only the
usual  chip-sounds in  this game. You can hear also some chip-musix but nothing
more.
The control over the mouse is easy.
The game features also  level-codes (look at  the hints in this magazine) and a
highscoretable and so the motivation is, even if the game itself has only a low
quality, saved for a while.
Only if you like games where you must think a little bit you should take a look
at it. All the joystick-fanatics should take her hands of this game.
