1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Ren‚-Gilles Deberdt. My  nickname is  Naoki Haga, and as  a ST-programmer I
  was known as IKI.

- How old are you?
- 23 (03/21/75)

- What (or who) do you look like?
- Blond hair, not short, not long, glasses...

- What's your job?
- I used to  work as a  journalist for a Japanese-animation related magazine.
  Now I  prefer to  be living  on the  sales of  my shareware programs, but I
  still write articles as free-lance.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- I  like  most  music  styles, especially  electronica  (Jean-Michel  Jarre,
  Kitaro..), instrumental (Mike Oldfield...), rock (Noir Desir, Radiohead...)
  and everything  that comes from Asia (Jacky Cheung from Hong Kong, Luna Sea
  from Japan, etc.)

- What are you favorites movies?
- Face/Off, Bullet in the head, Twelve Monkeys, Contact, Leon

- When did you come into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine?
- A Thomson TO7/70, in march 1987. I was fascinated by the idea of being able
  to program  a machine extensively. I had even learned Basic before touching
  my first keyboard...

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- TO7/70, Atari ST (doesn't  work  anymore, but  I  don't  want  to  throw it
  away...) PC (K6-200)

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- Programming, web-surfing, playing with emulators (ST, Super NES...)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- Around 1989. I had bought  an ST on  christmas '88 and started learning GfA
  Basic. I  created  a ST-band  with  friends  in my  city (Bugbusters, later
  renamed Firehawks) and we started to release some GfA screens. Later I left
  them and joined an incredibly high number of bands (Scanners (the only band
  I created), Confederation, Future Minds, Zuul, Vortex, Hysteria, and so on.
  ... the last one being The Storm Brothers).

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- I left the  scene in  late  september '91, when  my mother  passed  away. I
  wanted  to get  rid of  all my  past. That's  also when  I started to learn
  Japanese.

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- I've been active in all the crews I've been in.
  Some works I'd released:
  - a demo with the Bugbusters (I can't remember its  name at all... I'd done
    most of the screens but all of them were cool, at least for beginners)
  - the Axia Demo, in  Scanners. My  last GfA demo, though I've still written
    some GfA screens later, including a big bouncing scroller that filled the
    whole screen...
    Actually  it was  easier to  do that  what my  friends believed (it was a
    simple palette trick.....)
  - many asm screens, for various bands. Can't remember which ones though.
    Includes: a  Spreadpoint-like  screen (I  liked that  one), a full plasma
    (nice  colors), a  very  nice  screen  with  generated-code  sprites  and
    vertical rasters (it was released in the Phaleon Demo, as far as I know),
    a starfield with distorted scrolltext (it was my pride: it  had dozens of
    musics packed  into a 512kb-memory AND a 242kb scrolltext, that was never
    recognized  officially  as a  record-breaking  scrolltext  since  I never
    released  that  screen... but  actually  I don't care), and a simple X-Y-
    distorted scrolltext screen. I may have made many other screens but since
    I haven't kept track of them, I may be wrong -- or right.
  - I also released  in '91 an  anti-virus  that was quite popular, Exorcist.
    The third version  was never officially released (because  I'd sold my ST
    before), but  it had  a nice  disassembler, and  a boot-anti-virus  I was
    quite proud of. Some people around may still have the original source for
    this version (8000 lines of pure asm :))...

- How do you  view the decrease  of the Atari demo  scene in the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- Unfortunately I'm quite pessimistic about the ST future. I would have loved
  it to keep its nature, but it was mostly killed by the PC. But I bet no one
  would forget their ST, even fifty years after.

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- Not really. Because  my unit is broken down.... I'm still excited by the ST
  emulator "PaCifiST", and  I wish  I'd  find some  time  to write  some  new
  screens with it, but I guess it's too late now...

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- Mad Max's  musics. And  the scene. Especially  at  the STNICCC, in december
  1990, where I  had the opportunity to  meet Mad Max and TCB, my ST idols. I
  couldn't dare to  speak to  them, but it  was great  though, to see Mad Max
  playing on his Gameboy :)

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- It was there when  I was a teenager and when I needed to grow up. It helped
  me find out that there were people outside my house, and that they could be
  quite cool.

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- PaCifiST. Because my ST is broken, as I said earlier :)

3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- *sob*

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- It's not a "real" machine. It's a  gathering (?) of  various  periphericals
  without a soul. Every  PC is a  different machine. It  complicates much the
  programmers' work! ;)

- Have you heard about Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- Everybody can dream....

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- I just bought  it two days ago ;) (actually  just switched  from a P90 to a
  K6-200...)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's play  a little game. I'm going  to give you some subjects, you have
to say  way do you  think about  them. You  can answer  by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

ATARI CORP.     - Jack Tramiel, I miss you!!!

COMMODORE AMIGA - Cool  machine. Too  bad it  was so easy  to code  on it! At
                  least, the ST was a real challenge...

CRACKING        - Sucks.

DEMOS           - They rock! You can feel love in these creations.....

DEMO-SCENE      - It was  cool. Even if not  much people actually liked me, I
                  really liked them, at least.

FALCON 030      - Previous name for Pentium II.

INTERNET        - My third hand. My second brain. My memory.

LAMERS          - They suck hard. But they are so funny :)

JAGUAR          - A joke, I suppose ;-) (I've  never been  much into  console
                  machines, except for the Japanese RPG games)

MICROSOFT       - Bill Gates, younger: cool geek. Older: he forgot everything
                  about programming and prefers to kill the market. Poor guy.

PC              - Too bad  it's still  supposed to be  compatible with an old
                  8086...

THE UNION  8-)  - Rules :) And will rule forever!

VIDEO CONSOLES  - Monkey Island, Chrono Quest 2, Captain Blood, some ST games
                  really brought me so much! And let's think of Final Fantasy
                  as  well (on  Super  NES). Very  close  to  the "spirit" of
                  Japanese  culture  (sacrifice, ...). You  know  why  I'm  a
                  Saint Seiya fan :)
