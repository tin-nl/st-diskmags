                 main editor: MC Laser - co editing: Moondog

What  happened in  the last weeks  and month  in the  ATARI SCENE?! If you've
thought there isn't  much to tell you're  so wrong and even  I (moondog), the
hyper-pessimist, was very surprised about all the activities.

  will feature marvellous tridi stuff. Btw, it will be called ò"BINLINER"ð.
- He also cancelled ò"SONOLUMINESZENZ 2"ð, even  if a load  of routs and  stuff

{*f1BLUE - OVERLANDERS{*f0

- A new version of the òPLAYSID (v2.o1)ð was released.

{*f1DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY{*f0

- They have released two demos on  the óIMParty 6ð: a 128 BYTEtro (!) and their
  long awaited Falcon-smasher ò"DREAM DIMENSION"ð. Just check out the review in
  this UCM! What a  shame that a normal Falcon-user can't see it coz it needs
  the FPU...

  don't know who they are  really, can't believe  that real fascists can code
  the smallest demo thing by themselves... So guys! Come over  to Germany, we
  have no problems with kicking your motherfucking ass to hell... shit heads,
  if you have any courage in your "byxor" come along and show who you are!

  - Selectric v1.10E
  - Clix v3.60
  - MegaTracker Player v1.15
  - HomePage-Penguin v1.65
  This list isn't complete and we don't want to release boring cracking-lists
  anymore in the news... we will only mention a few and very important things
  in the future.
- The polish (ex?)cracking  team THE REBELIANTS has released an intro for the
  ELiTE-hack  of ò"CAVEMANIA"ð... btw, this  game was  made by the finish demo-
  group EXTREAM and it's fucking lame  in my eyes to crack  scene warez! I've
  heard  also  of  other  hacks of  later  scene-productions, which  will  be
  released by ELiTE too. So let me ask you one  thing: do you have any little
  piece of  pride and honour  in your dull bones?! Don't you know that you're
  breaking the  soul of the surviving  scene, the believe  of the last active
  people  into their  so called  friends?! Can  it be  that you're  really so
  stupid that you don't match  it to see which grave  you're digging with the
  cracking of scene warez?! It's ours and yours  too! Last but not least with
  these actions you're showing that you don't have any style and ofcourse any
  real interest in the surviving of the small Atari-scene! (moondog)
