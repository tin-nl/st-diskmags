                             STEVIE WONDER:
                     I WISH I COULD READ UNDERCOVER.
                 HOW ABOUT PUBLISHING IT IN BRAILLE, TOO?

In third week of january 1998, a new  crew from the depth  of France appeared
in the  scene's spotlight with another  128 bytro called "128 BYTE DEMO". The
new  team is  called "RESERVOIR FROGS" and  we hope you  can distinguish them
from British demoteam "RESERVOIR DOG...", ahem, "GODS".

After  starting this programm, the screen  is set black and a text appears on
the screen a lot of  times, saying "RESERVOIR FROGS 128 BYTE DEMO". The color
of the text flickers through different colors. By using the mouse, the screen
fucks up with a load of bombs.

I wonder what  this screen is  supposed to be. It not  only looks shit, it is
shit, too. I don't  understand people  that want  to surf on the same wave as
the outstanding SENIOR DADS, who raised not so cool democoding into fine art.

Finally, the  grandmasters of  bad taste, British  avantgarde demo-performers
SENIOR DADS released their imagination of a stylish 128 bytro on 20th january
1997. The READ ME-file  with a size  of 5kb is a must reading! After starting
the screen, a blocky red plasma appears on the screen, moving slowly upward.
Okay, some people might say that this is only some rubbish from RAM copied to
the screen, but  those guys just  don't understand the intelligent message of
SENIOR DADS' latest masterpiece:

Fine art can be done even without having a great style or heavy effects! It's
important  to tell the  people a  background about  the product and soon they
will believe in your work! In this way, SENIOR DADS' critizise  the whole art
business in a  fundamental manner. A really  good idea from the Britishs that
has to be rewarded by a high rating...
