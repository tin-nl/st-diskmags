-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Rickard Troedsson (Though everyone calls me Troed)

- How old are you?
- 23

- What (or who) do you look like?
- An escaped prisoner :)

- What's your job?
- Studying Software Engineering  and working in a company I own together with
  my fiancee.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- Almost  everything  from  Depeche Mode  to  Megadeth. Current  favourite is
  Rammstein :)

- What are you favorites movies?
- Natural Born Killers, The Ususal Suspects, Seven

- When did you come  into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine ?
- 1985 or  maybe 1986. I was  planning to buy  a C-64 when the dealer told me
  about this "incredible new machine with 512 colours  and 512+384Kb memory".
  A 520ST :). I had no  games or  programs except  ST-Basic for the first few
  months, and that's how I got into programming.

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- P200/64Mb RAM/4.2Gb SCSI-II Wide/17" ADI/12X SCSI-II CD-Rom/ET6000 graphix,
  Sony Playstation

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- Answering you questions  and programming everything from JavaScript to C++/
  Java :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- A dealer put me in contact with  Thomas Abrahamsson (BlueSTar), before that
  I only knew one Atari-owner, and he used it primarily for music.
  Nevertheless, we  started  up  a  group  called  "PWC"  (ProWare  Crew) and
  released  a demo! (StarDemo) .. Written in  GFA-Basic and  a few small asm-
  routines, it  wasn't _that_ revolutionary. We  formatted  the  disk  to  83
  tracks  11 sectors  to fit  everything  in, and  I don't think  anyone ever
  copied it .. ;)

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- I bought myself a PC. I had  a Falcon, but no programs did ever appear, and
  to stay  in touch  with the rest of  the world I had to do something. Since
  then  I haven't  done any  demo-programming  at all, except for some recent
  Java-applets. The PC wasn't as fun as the Ataris.

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- RTS - only existed by it's name
  PWC - see above. I programmed and did awful graphics for my own screens :)
  SMILE - joint venture by PWC and AAC (AntiAmiga Crew), existed for  about a
  week. I programmed my  first fullscreen at that time, and it was one of the
  first.
  SYNC - most members of SMILE were taken up by Sync (the rest followed after
  a while), but  things  got  more  chaotic  now. It's  hard  to  be  a  good
  programmer  when RedHead  could do _anything_ better  than  yourself! :) At
  least I tried.
  I.C.S - I did a few intros and cracked a few games.
  Elite - see I.C.S :)

- How do you view  the decrease of the Atari  demo scene in  the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- Hasn't it been dead for a long time?

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- I sold my last Atari, a 520ST, 2 weeks ago.

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- The  copy-parties  (ok  ok,  conventions). Everything  was  just  extremely
  crazy:)

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- Programming. The ST got me started, and now I've got job-offerings all over
  the place :)

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- PaCifiST - plain nostalgia.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- Do they exist?

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- People  should  stop  trying  to  make  incompatible  systems, since the PC
  structure  can handle everything that's needed (supercomputers excepted :).
  I wouldn't  touch a  system today  that can't run Microsoft programs, since
  such a system would have no future. NC excepted.

- Have you  heard about  Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- Nope. I do hope no one is trying to actually sell such things.

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- A Pentium II 450? My P200 is just too slow .. :) (Hey, it's over a year old
  with nothing upgraded :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's  play a  little game. I'm going to give you some subjects, you have
to say what do  you think  about them. You  can answer  by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

ATARI CORP.       - They tried, and they propably had some fun.

COMMODORE AMIGA - It was the  better  system, but  lacked the fun stuff (hack
                    the hardware to do overscan etc)

CRACKING        - A challenge. Too long a subject to discuss here, but a well
                  known  company making  games  for the  PC said (and this is
                  almost a quote :) "We don't care about piracy on the PC, it
                  is hardly noticeable". Cracking did not kill the Atari. The
                  lack of development and PC-compatability did.

DEMOS           - I liked a good demo  better than  a good  game. No  one can
                  understand that today :)

DEMO-SCENE      - Cool guys. We're making money today :)

FALCON 030      - A complete  failure. I cannot  understand why I ever bought
                  one.

INTERNET        - I've got a T1 connection - I like it! :)

LAMERS          - Today we call them "customers", and we do what they want.

JAGUAR          - Tempest 2000 *RULES*. I'm trying  to get  TempestX3  for my
                  PlayStation :)

MICROSOFT       - Great products - people who  complain are  most of the time
                  just  jealous. I don't  like what  MS is  trying to do with
                  Java though.

PC              - The only  computer  worth  mentioning today, and soon to be
                  the only system.

THE UNION  8-)  - Did nothing I couldn't do ... a few years later :)

VIDEO CONSOLES  - Quake is the best game ever, it's on the PC :)
