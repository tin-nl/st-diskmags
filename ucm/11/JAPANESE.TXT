Hum... meanwhile the most real demo-stuff is  died out  on ST one kind  of so
called demos has survived all the critical times: the slideshows. Even if all
around is  turning into  dust, every year  several new  slideshows for ST and
also for Falcon appearing, most of more or less good quality.
On the ST  one special kind of slideshows was  swapping through the frontiers
of France and if you  know about the fact that there are many  manga-freax in
this country you surely know which kind of slideshow I mean...
Yep, it's  again a manga-slideshow. There are nearly a dozen of  manga-slides
from the french scene around, mainly made by ACCS, SECTOR ONE and ARSENIC.
Hum, all those  bands are dead or have stopped their work on this sector. And
if you have thought you're save now, another band  appeared on the screen and
the guys of TYPHOON have taken over the job  to bring us tons of slippery and
mostly naked little japanese girls...
Ok, I don't want to  leave  any words about  the  show itself. It's the usual
thing with little intro (with some nice grafix) and  tons of pictures, fading
away by clicking  a button  or automatically  in different  style. There  are
about 4o manga-pics of more or less good quality (more x-rated please =) ...)
The show contains  chip-sound on  ST and tracker-sound on STE and Falcon. The
quality isn't bad. But as always there is no deeper sense behind the show.
All you have to do is sitting back and watch one babe after the other. If you
are no fan of this  manga-comics you'll  search for the esc-button as fast as
possible. The labile  manga-freax will perhaps  fight against  their hard one
and the profi's will be bored after some pictures, turning  on their modem to
meet the hard sites in the Inet...
Conclusion: it's not bad for a slideshow, but if you're a pure demo freak you
            should not try to get it, you would be disturbed...

AND A SECOND LOOK BY ST SURVIVOR/LOUD...

As I told  you last time TyphooN  has finally  decided to release this 3 year
old slide-show. Due to be a collaboration with Arsenic in the end it's almost
a  1oo%  TYPHOON  production.  The  code  was  done  by  The  Beast, pictures
"manipulation" by  Senser and the  oldish track was done by Audiomonster (yep
that's old!).

Actually this is quite a good surprise I must say. The intro itself is rather
stylish, first whith a raytraced "Arsenic and Typhoon present" and  then with
a sunset  picture. Then the  music starts and erm it sounds like dust, really
old stuff!! Too old!! Quite a  shame they  used such an  terrible soundtrack,
you know with these loosy trumpets  samples, beurk! Anyway it's  not the main
part (and you can try to put another track on the disk I tried and it worked)
so let's wrap!

Well you all know what a slide-show is and well.. that's it! All the pictures
are 16 colors  and come from  the Perverse Creature  even though you couldn't
guess. The  overall  quality of  these  forty (yes  4o!!) pictures is  really
satisfactory except for a few ones.
Btw I've forgotten to tell you that this is an erotic slide-show representing
young girls  in weird attitudes (getting  hot here 8-). Hum personally I like
this kind of pics but if you prefer pets or something less shocking then move
away!

Yes these  pictures look really  nice even though some of them were converted
from  256 color GIF! Unfortunately  sometimes it  may cause  a young woman to
have.... green  hair between the legs (looks like weed, smoke it 8-). Besides
I regret you  have to wait  so long between two pictures and, worse, it seems
the whole  demo cannot  be installed  on a hard-drive, at  least  I tried and
instead of running from there it loaded from the internal drive grr!

In spite of  these drawbacks  it's a good  slide-show all erotic piccies fans
will try to get 8-) The  tune really  sounds like pain in the ass but you can
remove the original soundtrack so...
