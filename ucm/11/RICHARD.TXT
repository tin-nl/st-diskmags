1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Richard Karsmakers

- How old are you?
- 30

- What (or who) do you look like?
- Glasses, balding, kind of tall. About  ten years  ago I had  a physical and
  it said I was of "athletic" build.

- What's your job?
- I am an office  automation teacher; I teach people the joys of working with
  Windoze 95, Word, Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Lotus Notes, the Internet and,
  possibly in the future, Visual Basic and VBA.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- Hardrock, heavy metal, synthesizer, black metal, Bjork.

- What are you favorites movies?
- Anything  that has  Aliens  in it, or Schwarzenegger, or made by Spielberg,
  Cameron, (Mc?)Tiernan  or Disney (as long as it's about animals, not humans
  like "Hercules").

- When did you  come into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine ?
- Summer 1984, a Commodore 64.

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- I've got  a Cambridge Computer Z88 somewhere in a cupboard, and a Commodore
  128D, and a PC (running GEMulator for ST stuff).

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- I never  use the  Z88 anymore, and  I only  used the  128D to listen to the
  old Rob Hubbard  and Martin Galway  tunes. Now  they've  appeared on the ST
  using SIDplay so I  rarely use it these days. I use the PC for  programming
  (under  GEMulator I  still update  my "Ultimate Virus Killer 2000", now  10
  years underway!) and serious stuff involving "Word" and "Access".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- In  1987  somewhere, I  had  a  contact  called  Markus Herfort (a.k.a. The
  Bitstopper, BST). He got  me in touch with TEX, and from there on I started
  writing  scroll  texts. I never  programmed  anything, I just came  up with
  some ideas and wrote scroll texts.

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- In 1991 or 1992, when  I no longer  had the  energy and the time to collect
  games and when I was getting really out of touch with the people.

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- Em...mid 1986 I was  member of  the  Desaster Area  for a while, after that
  Flash Cracking Group (originally a Commodore 64 outfit). Later I joined the
  Dutch Muggers Association  for a while, that was early 1988. But throughout
  that time I  have always been Cronos of the Amazing Cracking Conspiracy. I
  haven't  done any  cracking for  about 10  years now. In  1991 I joined the
  Quartermass Xperiment, a virtual  Dutch crew  consisting of Jurie "Relayer"
  Horneman (now  working at Blue Byte), Eloy "Apache", Laurens "The Mind" van
  der Klis and Alex "The Nutty Snake" Crouzen. We  haven't seen each other in
  years, which is probably why we're virtual.

- How do you view the  decrease of  the Atari demo scene  in the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- I think the  Internet will keep it active to some extent, but it won't live
  forever. But  there's still hope...the Commodore 64 scene is still alive 11
  years after the machine died...

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- Not  much, I  only  still  do "Ultimate Virus Killer", and  I am  currently
  setting up an "ST NEWS Lamentation Page" on the Web with the aid of Richard
  "Felice of Maggie Team" Spowart and Gard "Nutty Norwegian" Abrahamsen.

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- The ST News International Christmas Coding Convention, where  the  whole ST
  scene  attended with  the exception of Udo "-ME- of TEX" Fischer and Fabian
  "Oxygene of TLB" Hammer.

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- Joy, happiness, a  lot of  contacts  and  friends, a job at Thalion, and my
  best friend Stefan "Digital Insanity of TLB" Posthuma, with whom I also did
  ST News for quite a few years.

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- Yes, GEMulator. PacifiST  is  OK  but  I  use  it  a lot for typing and the
  keyboard driver sucks so I never really use it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- They're only  kept  alive by  a very  small and  very enthusiastic scene. I
  think  that's really  cool. I don't  like the  company  Atari, though. They
  never supported  the scene and all those rumours about the MicroBox several
  years ago were all fake.

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- They suck  dino cock. Programs  on it are written  clumsily and are way too
  big. But if  your computer  is fast enough (P166 or more) and you have 2 Gb
  or more  hard disk, you  can do  really  cool  things. I really dig some PC
  games, like "Carmageddon" and "Duke 3D".

- Have you heard about Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- They're usually too expensive, and I don't understand why companies bother.

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- I should, because  I only  have  a P60  and  can't  even  run "Carmageddon"
  decently. But  I'm  extending  it  from  16 to  32 Mb  internal and maybe a
  processor speeder or something.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's  play a  little game. I'm going to give you some subjects, you have
to say  what do you  think about  them. You  can answer by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

- ATARI CORP.     - Great computers, but they managed to fuck up every single
                    thing they did, including Lynx and Jaguar and Falcon.

- COMMODORE AMIGA - Great for playing  games. Everybody  went nuts  about the
                    soundchip, but  I personally  still think  the C-64's SID
                    chip was the best ever.

- CRACKING        - Well, I used  to do it, too, but  you shouldn't forget to
                    *buy* really  good games  just  because  you  want *more*
                    games like  that. Cracking killed off the ST, partly, but
                    on the PC  there are  so many  suckers  who buy bad games
                    that the cracking  scene will not  cause any companies to
                    go bankrupt soon.

- DEMOS           - The heart of every  computer scene. The  ST scene was, to
                    me, interesting  primarily  because  TEX and  TLB and TCB
                    were there.

- DEMO-SCENE      - See above.

- FALCON 030      - Cool. Should  have had  a  faster  processor. Should have
                    been supported better by Atari.

- INTERNET        - A good way to  stay in  touch with  people, and do things
                    cheaply (like publishing  a magazine), and  get all kinds
                    of stuff (programs, MODs, JPEGs, etc.).

- LAMERS          - They're  as  old as  computers. Just  think  about it: If
                    there weren't any lamers, the True Scene People would not
                    seem to damn brilliant.

- JAGUAR          - A big damn shame. Best  games thing  ever for a few years
                    until  Nintendo 64  and Playstation  came  around. Should
                    have done a *lot* better than it did.

- MICROSOFT       - As I've heard, this  applies to Bill Gates' dick. Anyway,
                    I don't like their marketing strategies, the way they try
                    to knock Netscape off the market, and the way they try to
                    fragmentize Java standards.

- PC              - A necessary  evil, held  down  by  ancient  architecture,
                    allowing bad  programmers to make halfway decent programs
                    because those new  ones are so damn fast. If you see what
                    TEX and the  like could  do with 8 Mhz, just imagine what
                    could be done in machine code on a P166 or faster. But it
                    doesn't happen because people  write in C  or some  other
                    high level language.

- THE UNION  8-)  - Gods!

- VIDEO CONSOLES  - Pretty OK. I still have a Lynx.

Well, that's  the end of this  interview. You  can add a message below if you
want (even a huge one!):

Um...if people  want to get  their hands on "Ultimate Virus Killer 2000", the
definitive  virus killer  for the ST, they  should  contact me. Also, if they
want to  be told  first when the ST NEWS Lamentation pages are up on the Web,
they should contact me. I can be reached at karies@wxs.nl.

OK, thank you very much for answering and see ya next time!
