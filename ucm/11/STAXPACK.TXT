-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After months  of silence  short after  Xmas four new packs by the last active
german compact crew were released. Because of the lack of  new stuff and that
MATT is doing all the stuff by himself and  ofcourse the lack of time because
of his  studies the release  of this last surviving  compact  series shrinked
down and from time to time I thought that he finally gave up.
And so I was  very surprised to get four brand new menus, all released on the
same day, 27.12.97.
Ok, this is a good news, but now I must  tell you, that  the  quality of this
packs shrinked from volume to volume and this is very sad. After several lame
UK-bands also MATT started to pack older demos on his disx and I really can't
understand this move, even if some of the stuff was never on a CD on Atari.
Another bad point is, that he still uses very old intros  and this time on is
used on  three disx! I don't  know why, even  if I know  that it's hard to do
many new  intros, but it seems to  be a bad habit of the present packer-scene
to use one  and the same intro on several disx or using the same sources many
times.
And so I remember back to the cool times of Animal Mine, who created original
intros  nearly everytime, some of them had a quality which  was never reached
again by other compact makers.
But as always today we have  to accept these less good packs because we've no
other choice, even if it hurts. =(
But back to the disx. I have here  the menus 144, 145, 146 and 147 and you'll
find the following stuff on them:
* compact menu 144 - Michigan Mike - PD jump'n'run
                   - Island Strike - shareware shot'em'up
                   - Space Fighter - preview of the shot'em'up
                   - Motion Pac - little fake demo
                   - Cross - very old intro by DNT CREW
                   - Bugblatterbeast - 4 Ktro of the SILIcon'97 by .tSCc.
* compact menu 145 - My Dog Is Enjoying Fuzion - old demo by IMPACT
                   - Drooling - intro from the InterCon'96 by CHECKPOINT
                   - F6 - fake demo from the SILIcon'97 by CREAM
                   - Coffeebreak - little screen by TCW
                   - ST Floormat - fake demo by the SENIOR DADS
* compact menu 146 - Kylie Minogue Sample Demo - horrible shit!
                   - Listdisk Intro - oooooold stuff by TION
* compact menu 147 - Mega Leif Demo - ULM's last demo on ST
                   - Colourshock 6 - kewl screen by THE RAIDER BROTHERS
Ok, I will write some stuff about all the stuff now. As you can see, the very
latest stuff  is also  about 8 months old and this is a point  I really can't
understand because  there was some stuff released in time for the ST, like on
the Orneta Party.
- MICHIGAN MIKE  and  ISLAND STRIKE  are two  games from UK  and I decided to
  write a special review for the first of them because they're relative new.
- SPACE FIGHTER... I'll  don't leave any words about this brilliant game, but
  remember, it's over one year old!
- CROSS is an old intro made by the DNT CREW. Nothing special.
- BUGBLATTERBEAST was .tSCc.'s contribution to the SILIcon'97 and had won the
  competition, but was already included on other compacts (ST COLLECTION) =(
- MOTION PAC is another intro, was done to force AGGRESSION  to release their
  MOTION BLUR demo. As you know, it never happened =(
- MY DOG IS ENJOYING FUZION by IMPACT, a demo from the good old times and the
  slagging wars between several cracking bands from France.
- DROOLING by Checkpoint presented fire vectors on the ST, over one year old.
- F6 by CREAM... only  a fake demo, nothing special... better stuff from this
  crew is coming soon!
- ST FLOORMAT by  Senior Dads, another fake demo in the well known style from
  this crazy guys.
- COFFEEBREAK by the CHAOS WARRIORS (erm, think so), will not run on my ST =(
- KYLIE MINOGUE sample  demo, a very useless and senseless  STOS demo, should
  be deleted  and I really  can't understand  the move to pack such shit to a
  demo pack!
- You want to laugh about Skinheads first words to the Atari scene? Just take
  a look at the TION intro, for germans only =) ...
- ULM's MEGA LEIF demo  from May  1993, the last  ST production from the only
  demo group from Luxembourg... only two screens, nothing special.
- COLOURSHOCK 6 by THE RAIDER BROTHERS, original released in  1993, but first
  seen on several boards last year, great demo.. even if the makers are gone!
Hum, I've seen better disx from STAX in former times. I would let out all the
old stuff  and  release only  a few disx, but then with all the stuff on them
you should have. The  old stuff is only ballast which no one needs and also I
did't needed the most stuff. The only things I don't knew were the two games,
the fucking Kylie-demo and the ULM demo. All the other wasn't new to me.
Very disappointing  are all intros. They're  all nearly  the same and looking
all other as good or stylish. It's only sad. If you see them you think you're
beamed back in the years of 1990 or so...
Let us hope that MIKE, the other active member has more time  for coding some
stuff on ST again now so that we can see new and good intros in the future!
It would be a big loss if this series would be stopped too, because there are
only TYPHOON and EFFECT left besides STAX, doing legal compacts for the ST if
we don't count stuff like the MOD COMPILS by .tSCc. (I would  count them more
as real music-disx)...
Even if these packs  are thought  for collectors I  don't think  that they're
very interested  in them. Disk 144 is the most interesting one because of the
games and  volume 145 because of the little new screens and demos. The others
are useless.
It seems as the original meaning  of demo packs is lost, in former times guys
like ANIMAL MINE, RIPPED OFF or PERSISTENCE OF VISION have created those disx
to present  the latest stuff and intros, collected to one nice styled disk so
that you not must search for all the single stuff.
Today it  seems as packs  were released  to release  anything at all, nothing
more, because it's very seldom to find packs with really new stuff.
And another point of the old days is lost, not quantity, no we need quality.
Several groups have damaged this idea by release as much disx as possible.
I think it would be better to create only  one disk every month  or every two
months, containing all the latest and kewl stuff, nothing more. So you had no
lack of intro-stuff, would have time to  create new  intros and also the good
reputation would not be damaged because we  all know that the output on stuff
which is worth to be packed on such demo packs is shrinked down like hell.
So, after this long lines about my opinion of demo packs I hope that the last
survivors of this part of the scene will try to go back to the roots!
