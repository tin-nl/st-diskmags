-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Hello. My  name is  Mickael Pointier, but I'm better known as Dbug from the
  french demo crew called "NeXT".

- How old are you?
- 27 years old.

- What (or who) do you look like?
- Oups. I'm 1.86m tall, dark  hairs,... Nothing  really original in fact. I'm
  looking tall compared to MIT, but dwarfish compared to Furyo. :)

- What's your job?
- I'm  programmer. I'm  working  on  PlayStation(TM/(c):) for  a game company
  somewhere in Lyon.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- Various. I  support  techno  and  hip-hop, but  I prefer  stuff like Bjork,
  Smashing Pumkins, David Bowie, Vivaldi, and many movie soundtracks.

- What are you favorites movies?
- Definitively not StarWars or Jurassic Park (don't kill me please!).
  Trouble with that question is about movie titles... Do you know "la couleur
  pourpre" from Steven Spielberg? I  like too  MarsAttacks, TrueRomance, MIB,
  Predator, Terminator, Schindler's list, "ghost chineese story".

- When did  you come into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine?
- It was a ZX80  when I was  in CM2 (around 9  years old?) discovered  at the
  local  club. I will finally  buy an Oric Atmos 2 years after. Paid  with my
  sweet and blood.

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- By order of obsoletism:
  1 Oric 1
  1 Oric Atmos
  1 Oric Telestrat
  1 Atari 520 ST (upgraded to 2.5 meg)
  1 Falcon 030 (standard)
  1 PC (Cyrix 166+,24 meg)

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- I'm programming  demos on the Oric, for the Orics Users around the world. I
  use the ST  only to watch  demos. The  Falcon is  switched on sometimes for
  trying new stuff.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- I release 2 intros in start 1988 under the name crew "T.T.Z.P. Inc." Then I
  joined NeXT in late 1988.

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- I stopped programming the ST in 1995 because my job at Adeline Software was
  taking too much time.

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- In TTZP, I  release an intro  with a green  dragon moving around the screen
  (this one  was used  by Axe of  Delight  for a cracked game), and a Dungeon
  Master like in left and  right overscan that  was the entry  ticket for the
  scene. After  the release of this intro we've been contacted (MIT and I) by
  the Overlanders and NeXT. We finally joined NeXT. In NeXT, I participate to
  Charts 2, 3, 5 and 6, as well as  the "Official Charts Compilation" in 1991
  and to the "Phaleon GigaDemo" in 1992. (I've done the intro screen, Dungeon
  menu, Fast menu, Fullball screen, Illusion STE screen, ...)

- How do you  view the  decrease of  the Atari demo scene in the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- As I'm still  supporting  8 bits  computers, I  discovered  that  they were
  always  users/developers on  AppleII, Atari 800, Commodore 64, Vectrex (!),
  Oric :),...
  So I suppose  that  people will  still  supporting the ST. Perhaps the only
  difference  will  be  that "Atari Demos" will  appear  in  the "wild compo"
  category!
  For me, the  dead of  Atari demo  scene starts  with the  appearance of the
  Falcon. So  many coders were waiting for a blazing fast computers, and when
  the  Falcon finally  arrives... Gasp, snail... Ok, you  have a DSP. Ok, you
  have  HiColor... But  68030 is  so slow! Memory  is so slow! Blitter  is so
  slow! Terrible.

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- No. I'm not. I'm  using the PC emulator PaCifiST for playing old games, and
  testing demos...

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- Cool time  while  coding, nice  coding  parties, nice  people, nice fucking
  greets :)

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- The  ability to  code fullscreen intros (meaning  cycle  synchronized code)
  for many  years teaches  you  to be  efficient  while  programming! And the
  Phaleon Demo was my entry ticket for my actual job (game programer).

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- I use PaCifist. I  try to makes all  our old code works under it, so people
  can see theses intros.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- "ST  magazine" and "PARX" are  still  alive. Interesting. Perhaps "Jurassic
  Park" would be a reality? (Some dinosaurs at the modern age).

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- Since I'm obliged to use PC at work, I just have to say that a good PC with
  Windows  95, Direct X, great video  card... Is  really something great. The
  bottom line is that Windows is not very "stable" when you're a developper.

- Have you heard about Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- Medusa, hades, milan... I buy  ST mag every six month (or more). I think it
  is  interesting for  people still  using Calamus  or other GEM professional
  stuff.

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- I will upgrade my PC. Why? It's an one year old PC! (Other PC bottom line)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's  play a  little game. I'm going to give you some subjects, you have
to say  what  do you think  about them. You  can answer by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

ATARI CORP.     - They could have  done great job if they were not so stupid/
                  blind/...

COMMODORE AMIGA - A good machine, good OS, good chipset.

CRACKING        - I've got many cracked games. But I've bought some of them I
                  played a  lot with (Dungeon Master, Populous, Chaos Strikes
                  Back, ...)

DEMOS           - The more interesting stuff  to see on  a ST/C64/Amiga/Oric/
                  Apple2 now. The less interesting stuff to see on a PC now.

DEMO-SCENE      - A mix of interesting people, and f.ck.ng as.h.les

FALCON 030      - A good concept, a bad realisation.

INTERNET        - Something really great!

LAMERS          - See DEMO-SCENE, last part

JAGUAR          - See FALCON 030

MICROSOFT       - See LAMERS

PC              - Powerfull Calculator?

THE UNION  8-)  - Union Rules?

VIDEO CONSOLES  - hum... No Opinion!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's  the end of this  interview. You  can add a message below if you
want (even a huge one!):

If you're interested  in demos, just go  on the internet. You can find plenty
of interesting  people (Carebears, Sync, Oxygene, ULM, NeXT (!),...), some ST
emulators, FTP sites with demoes, pages with Demo History, etc...
If you're  a PC owner  now, you  can listen  to all  the old soundchip musics
with the YM Emulator from Leonardo (Oxygene), etc...
Ok, that's all for now.
See ya NeXT time, Mike/Dbug.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, thank you very much for answering and see ya next time!
