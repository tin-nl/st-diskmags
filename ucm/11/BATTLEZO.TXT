"What?" was my first thought as I red about this game  in MAGGIE # 24, "Worms
for my good old ST?!" and yes, it's a pure Worms-clone.
I think the  most of you know  this game from  Amiga, PC or a console. It's a
very  nasty blow'em  away game, could  be a  mixture  of Lemmings  and Cannon
Fodder, the style of Lemmings and the brutality of the second game.
You have a team of  four worms and  of course there are a load of other teams
around (in the tournament mode 8 teams). In every round of the game two teams
must fight  each other. The  goal is to kill  all the worms of the other team
and for this you can use 10 different weapons, from the machine-gun up to the
bazooka  or a powerful airstrike. Also  some  helpfull  things like teleport,
tunnels and so one are available.
The game goes in rounds, every round one worm can do one action, like build a
tunnel or just fight against another  one. The teams working turn by turn and
to make this game not too easy or brainless the rockets, grenades  and so one
are not only limited, no  you have also the good old wind who will change the
flight route of several weapons (like the bazooka bullets) and so you have to
think a little  bit when you have to  use which weapon and in which angle and
power you have to shot them. And so it goes on.
Every worm  has 100 hitpoints  at the start and you can bomb him away or just
try to kick him out of the screen.
There is nothing more to tell you, you just have to get and play the game...
The principe of the game is the same as on  Amiga. Unfortunately the technics
are not as  good. The  grafix have lost  a bit of style and are only mediocre
and sometimes a bit childish too but they're doing the job.
The sound  isn't bad, you  have a  nice music  in the intro  and some sampled
sound in the  game  itself and so you can listen to explosions or some little
comments of your actions spoken by the worms... It seems  as the makers  have
used the  original Amiga samples but I don't remember right (had played Amiga
Worms about  one year ago). But  I miss something, because if nothing happend
you will  nothing hear and so  a little bit more  background sound had surely
build up a better atmosphere...
The control is good, just some mouseclicks and the action starts but you need
some time  to get  the right  control of every  weapon but which game you can
play without reading any instructions? After  some hours you will control the
worms as good as a general his soldiers on the battlefield.
And it makes fun! This  is the  biggest point. Alone  it could be boring with
the time because  there are only four different  types of landscapes included
(snow, desert, castle  and hell) where  you can fight against the others. The
castle  and the  hell-levels  are every time  the same, while desert and snow
levels will be created random.
Even if you can chose the level of difficulty from very easy to hard it seems
to have no  special effect. I'm not sure about this, but esp. on  the  random
levels  even in the  easiest difficulty you can be blown away in the shortest
time. The computer  enemies are a bit too good, because  also bazooka bullets
can be fly over the whole playfield without loosing the target, while I never
matched it to fire with the bazooka in bigger ranges.
But the motivation  doesn't suffer  too much  under this  point. If you can't
fight man  against man you  have to make  some  tunnels or so one to get your
worms out of the  shooting-range. But  if you get a friend or more (up to 7!)
to fight against, it will make fun like hell! They're not better as you and I
don't think that they  can calculate a flight route over the whole screen and
so they have to search for the close fight and what makes more fun as to blow
a worm away with grenade, cluster bomb or bazooka who stands only some pixels
besides you?
So for all out there: just get this game! It's really worth a look because it
is a relativly good conversion, if you don't depend to much on the outfit and
sound, it makes  just fun and  I've seen very  seldom games like this one for
the ST in the last time. So go ahead and get it!
Btw, perhaps it will run on Falcon too with STOSFIX...
