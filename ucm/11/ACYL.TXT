The authors  of this mag  like to apoligize for the late review of this prod.
Due to Moondog's damaged Fo3o it was not possible to test it earlier.

"ANY COLOR YOU LIKE" is the third demo  produced by the  SHADOWS from Poland.
It is the winner-demo from ORNETA 97, the largest demo party in Poland.

To install  it, it takes you  ca. 3,1 MB harddiskspace  of your Falcon and to
run it you have to use a RGB-monitor/TV-set.

At first I've to say that I'm NO coder and that could be why some description
of the  effects  are not  that perfect. Further, I  never  reviewed  anything
before, but I'll give my best.

After having started the program we can see the name of the demo, accompanied
by several  effects. I  think  these  are  something  like  a  ROTZOOMER  and
DISTORTERS.

After  that  you  can read  the  CREDITS, again  with  some  effects  in  the
background.
It's a bit strange...the credits  at the beginning...but at least a new idea.
At the same time the music gets very groovy. The music itself is a mixture of
a lot of  bass, strange  noises (like cries  from an  animal) and  very high,
squealing strings. I really like this mixture, it causes a strange mood.

Now a very nice  effect appears on the screen: BUMPMAPPING with some bubbles.
Bumpmapping with some bubbles? - What's that??
OK, I just will say what it  looks like. It looks like some bubbles of air in
water, or  so... and it  looks really  cool! (maybe it  isn't bumpmapping but
fire)

The next part is a TUNNEL with a changing  perspective, that means the tunnel
is flying arround the screen. The special thing about this tunnel is not that
it is very smooth, but that the monitor seems to be dirty, because there is a
picture in the foreground.
In my eyes the picture belongs to the design..and it really looks better than
all the tunnels we have seen before, just because this picture. CooL idea!

The following effect I just call "SOMETHING STRANGE", because it is something
strange ;)  On the screen there is a picture of a highway or so, whose colors
are changing and well, there is also something strange on the screen..

After that, two  TEXTURETUNNELS appear  on  the screen, circling  around each
other.
Another TUNNEL follows, this time it  is a square-tunnel. It is colourcycled,
so you can see it in any color you like..
It looks nice, something I have never seen before.

Then, another of these "SOMETHING STRANGE" effects comes back and is followed
by a TUNNEL, again. The pink-white tunnel is pentagonal this time.
Looks pretty.

You won't believe me, but the next effect is a TUNNEL.
But it is no ordinary tunnel. To be more precise there are two tunnels and
they are doing movements like blobs do.

How about the next effect..a TUNNEL  :)
In my  opinion, this  tunnel is  the ruling  tunnel of  this demo. Tunnels in
general  are nothing new, but  this one  is special. There  is a fucking cool
light source  at the end of it. So, while  you are flying through the tunnel,
you are dazzled by the light. Wow!!

After that tunnel-orgy we are seeing some 3D-STUFF: A complete 3D-engine with
texture- and, I suppose enviromentmapping too, presents us some objects, such
as a cube or a octaeder (-looks like a torus with edges).
The objects  fly arround in cyberspace and some even do z-buffering. Well, it
is a  nice  3d-world, but  I have  to  admit, that  I was  a bit  bored while
watching  this part. Probably  because I  am spoiled by  the fast 3D-routs in
SONOLUMINESZENZ. (the routs of YONEK seem not to be as fast)

Now, a very-nice-drawn  picture by INSERT is showed. Somehow it reminds me to
Flower Power.

And finally, we can read the common words: "THE END".


{*f1CODE:{*f0

There are lotsa  tunnels, BUT one  better than the other. I really like those
"What the Hell is that??"-effects, because I get bored when I see bumpmapping
or shadebobs  the 50th time. I think, to  code a demo  containing a whole 3D-
engine, alone, is a great afford. Especially YONEK released the last one only
5 months ago (at SILICONVENTION).

==> 88%


{*f1GRAPHICS:{*f0

The demo does not contain many painted graphics..I think most of the graphics
are scanned, BUT  the picture in  the end is  really good. (I especially like
the sweet little duck :)
What I did not like was, that the effects do not turn into the next. They are
just shown, then the screen turns black and the next effect appears.

and that is why I believe:

==>73% are OK, also because some pictures  look buggy(?). E.g. the pic of the
       highway has some errors at the upper border.
       So INSERT if it was not your fault, you can take 5% of YONEK's :)


{*f1MUSIC:{*f0

The music emphasizes the mood of the demo. It sounds strange, frightening and
very groovy. The Timing is acceptable, too.

==>85%

{*f1GENERAL:{*f0

This demo is surely the best one I've seen from Poland so far, and the 3,1 MB
are worth to be kept. "Any Color You Like" is very stylish, everything refers
to a mood of mystery and tension. Well done.
