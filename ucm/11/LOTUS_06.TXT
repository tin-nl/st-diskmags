On 27th of  december 1997 another  preview of a  game with work-title "Lotus"
appeared in the  scene-download-sites  all over Europe. This  time it is vo.6
and finally it  is possible for me to test it, because it now runs on RGB/TV,
too.

...do you  still remember  maybe the  best racing-games  on atARi, the "LOTUS
ESPRIT TURBO CHALLENGE"-series? British software-house GREMLIN released three
parts of it  during 199o-1993 and  they were  real smashs! In middle of 1997,
two motivated  Swedish guys no  one heard of before started to code a game in
the same style. And the production seems to make big steps...

In comparison  to the  earlier version  which I  saw only  for a few moments,
version o.6 has a lot of  improvements. After  starting the  preview-package,
which is already  about 2 megabytes in size, a road appears on screen. In its
middle we can see a car just like in the original versions. The background is
filled with a nice  truecolor-scan, showing a  landscape with mountains and a
lot of  wood. A yellow time-counter  is displayed in  the lower right part of
the screen, indicating  how much  time is left for  finishing the stage. From
time to time other cars come driving down the road. ..so let's start driving.

Hmm, start driving. The  README-text that  was enclosed  to the  package says
that the car  might be controlable by three different methods: with joystick,
keyboard and Jaguar-pad. So let's try it...

Humm, pretty strange! The car  doesn't move from  its original place. Not one
step forward. Not by clicking on the arrows of the keyboard (it only moves to
the left and  the right), not by pressing some of the control pads' keys with
trembeling  fingers. Just  no reaction but  a timid move  to the left or  the
right.

But hey! Doesn't the whole thing look  a bit buggy at all? The  authors wrote
something about sound during the race. But there are only some strange noises
coming out of my boxes. And  the START-banner over  the racing-stage flickers
in some  strange manner, too. So...let's say that the version is a bit buggy,
and therefor we cannot move forward. Bad, but not too bad; I guess the reason
for not working is my old Falcon having only TOS 4.o1 and a SKUNK-accelerator
and being buggy with a lot of Swedish productions (Hi Evil!;).

...but then...some days  later I checked out the version once more and tested
every single  key and controlling-possibility. And  I found  out that the car
can accelerate  by pressing  the right  mousekey. Unfortunately  the car only
drives  maybe 5 seconds till  it passes a "START"-banner. Then the whole game
stops and a quite good module is played. So, the bug wasn't at the beginning,
but I would say that the bug is here, because the game doesn't go on, it just
stopped after driving 1o meters. Puhhh...


In further versions of this game, some more sceneries such as forest, winter,
desert, tropics, city and much more will be implemented. The DSP is used just
for the sound-replayer at the moment. (the one by Bitmaster/TCE, of coz; btw:
they want  you, BITMASTER, to  contact them for  some reason!! so if you read
this, grab a pen!)

Finally, the guys of NATURE have  one BIG PROBLEM: they need a graphician who
could style some of the races' objects. Here's what they wrote in the README-
file:

"One thing that takes unnecessary huge amounts of time when creating games is
 usually the graphics. That applies to  this case also, and since time is one
 of the things we  don't have in unlimited  supply, we would be very grateful
 if you  (yes, Y.O.U) helped us a bit.
 If you think  you can draw  reasonably nice  trees and other objects  by the
 road,  or raytrace  them, then please  send them to my E-mail address and we
 will see if  they will  suite the game. If  you draw something please use at
 least  65536  colours, preferrably  the .F16, .TIF or .TGA  formats (if  TGA
 please use 24bit uncompressed). Try to keep the objects in the same scale. I
 mean, so that  there won't be a tree that's smaller than the road signs, for
 example. The curve  signs are 4ox4o  when they are closest to the car, which
 is about  half the width  and height  of the car. You  only have to draw one
 picture of any one object (of course the biggest one), we'll scale them down
 later. Another thing to  keep in mind is not to draw too long shadows on the
 objects. The shadow  should be  right below the  object, and not stretch too
 much in any direction. To more clearly  see what I mean study the objects in
 the original  Lotus III, for  example. We  also happily  accept .3DS or .3D2
 files (at  least  2ooo faces) of  cars, so  that we can  raytrace  them. All
 contributors will be listed in the credits in contributing order."

So if you want  to paint or  raytrace something  for this  game-project, just
write to one of the following adresses:

                                 541 31 Sk”vde
                                    Sweden

      (Pease note that the e-mail address on those pages is not correct)


Unfortunately  LOTUS vo.6 is a bit buggy (or at  least the racing-time is far
too short), so we  were not  able to  test it  in areal  racing-mode. We even
checked it on a  VGA-monitor for  several times, but didn't succeed to get it
working fine. Nevertheless, LOTUS  looks really  promising and we are anxious
waiting to check out new preview-versions!

UPDATE:

On 6th of  february 1997  another debugged preview of this game was released.
It is V0.71 and from this version on called "REEKING RUBBER".
NATURE removed the nice scanned background picture (which I liked most in the
old  version  because  it gave  a good  atmosphere!) and put some not so cool
looking handdrawn mountains to this place.
But the most important point is that you can drive a track with your car now.
The car is  quite good to control and the track already showed a lot of power
the  game-engine has. There  were already  hills and valleys, checkpoints and
opponents. Even  if there are  a lot of things to  do (e.g. replace that ugly
car by  a good handdrawn  one, making  some  white lines  to the  motorway, a
shadow under the car  and motor-noises) it  can already be said that "REEKING
RUBBER" will be the best car-racing game for the Falcon...
