Hum, what will you find in the coming issue?!
At first all the missing articles from this issue. I wanted to test much more
softwares but I lost all  motivation last  days, just wanted to kick out this
fucking issue as fast  as possible. I don't like it to have a nearly finished
production on my disx. I don't find any reason to go on in the last stages of
work and so it's better to stop all tortures and kick out the stuff.
So you will find  reviews of the SURVIVORs intros, of the ECHO MAGAZINE 7, of
the new MAGGIE (hehe), several shareware games for ST and Falcon (at least we
hope so) and of course reports of VOLCANIC and ALTERNATE party, including the
reviews of the released software.
Also more  interviews will pop  up next  time, as well  as final informations
about the forthcoming parties.
I hope that also  the other areas  will grow up a little bit next time, but I
don't had the motivation to write some shit only to fill up the single areas.
Ok, so go away, read the current issue and be prepared for our next hit!
