INTERVIEW with: BANDIT/CLIMATICS                     Done by: MC LASER/.tSCc.

=============================================================================

Hello Bandit!

Ages ago we wrote that CLIMATICS are dead but suddenly their BBS called 'HANG
LOOSE' came  back to  life  again  and as fast  as it appeared it dissapeared
again. Sysop of this BBS was BANDIT/CLIMATICS.


UCM:    First  tell  us  a  little  bit  of  your  history. How did you start
        computing and what groups you were in.

BANDIT: Jep it  was in the  86 when I get my first *real* computer  a 1040STf
        before I only was playing aroung with a Philip's Video Pack system..
        Really soon I discovered that many  dudes at my school also bought an
        Atari and the fun began...
        At a swiss computer fair i meet some  guys from TDA (you remember), I
        was impressed of their cracks & intro's.
        Some days later a friend of mine  came with a good  idea why don't we
        build our own group..
        Jep we did it. EMT was born. At  this time  I started to  sold all my
        Games  to other  people... It was  quite funny to see how many people
        were interested in those 0 day warez ;-)))
        In about  89 I tought  it would  be kewl to  have a own BBS.. So Hang
        Loose was born..
        After  some years of mostly swapping &  selling  games, I  made a big
        mistake.... Hehe, I  cracked Calamus S 2.0 German version and swapped
        it into  all  major BBS's (Eagles  Nest, Night Train, Stampede, .....
        jep  AT&T  did it)... Not  one  week  later  I received a letter from
        CALAMUS germany ;-) So Hang Loose died, EMT died :-(
        Just only  3 week's  later  when I  check out that it's impossible to
        bust me in good old Switzerland (at  this time  it wasn't a  crime to
        sell copies in swiss) Hang Loose BBS was online again  and a new crew
        was born CLiMATiCS..


UCM:    What is your job in Climatics?

BANDIT: Don't know.. Hehehe as always I was the man  on the front... all shit
        has to be done from my site..
        tnx to wolf, gently, fox, poldi, xilef.. and all the other's for your
        great work and the good times we had


UCM:    Now to your  board. What has forced you to put it back online and why
        is it offline again now?

BANDIT: Jep I tought it was cool  to open my BBS again.. As you  maybe know I
        had to left my home my parents kicked  me out ;-) But as I called all
        the other boards I found out that nearly all BBS died.. And all those
        kewl Dudes: Zaphood, Troed even Sledge had no more motivation to keep
        up  the trading.... This  was  the time  to say  good  bye forever to
        running a BBS :-(((


UCM:    Can we expect any new Climatics-Releases in the future?

BANDIT: It's been  years ago since  I has just typed one word on the good old
        Atari.. But the spirit is still alive...


UCM:    Well, I  asked  Teddy  about  the  situation  of  the  Atari-Scene in
        Switzerland last time so I ask you also now. What's up?

BANDIT: Well  it's boring... All  of them dreaming  from the old times but if
        you ask them to do something they laught at you...


UCM:    How many megabytes of Atari-warez have you pirated in your life?

BANDIT: Hehehehe that's the question I like to answer.. My BBS HD was about 2
        Gig's.. hehehe so I think that's says everything.


UCM:    The crowd may be bored of this one but who cares? How old are you?

BANDIT: 23, are there any girls out there???


UCM:    What kind of machines do you own?

BANDIT: At the  moment I'm running  a DEC 4100 machine at home (kewl fast!!).
        And also  I still  own my  Mega STF and  also one  of these  Falcon's
        hehehe...


UCM:    What is your fave game for the ST?

BANDIT: I liked to play Lethal Xcess, Speedball I


UCM:    What is your fave demo for ST?

BANDIT: Froggies over the Fence


UCM:    What  interests  do you  have apart  from  computing? Fave  music for
        example.

BANDIT: Hehe, Girls?!
