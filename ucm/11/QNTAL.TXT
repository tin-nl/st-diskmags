released by Gymnastic Records 1992

You surely can remember (if you're a regular  reader of  the UCM) that  I had
reviewed  the  second album  of this  DEINE LAKAIEN  side-project in an older
issue of the UCM.
Because I  don't had the  money to  buy all compacts  I like I must wait long
time and  finally we had Xmas-time and I got the first album of this medieval
electronic wave project.
As already mentioned they're producing very melodic electronic wave with many
synthie stuff, combined with classic instruments and a great female voice.
All lyrics are presented in latin, old french or old high german.
The lyrics are all traditional (eg. Walther von der Vogelweide) and sometimes
also the music.
Ok, I go go over to the contents:

01.  Un vers de dreyt nien
02.  Ad mortem festinamus
03.  Anc non lo vi (Un vers de dreyt nien II)
04.  Por mau tens
05.  Floris e Blanchaflor
06.  Unter der linden
07.  Rossinhol
08.  Non sofre de Santa Maria
09.  Doussa res
10.  Jherusalem
11.  Sanctus (Ad mortem festinamus II)
12a. Black Death (Ad mortem festinamus III)
12b. Un vers de dreyt nien III

The whole  CD has a  playlength  of a hour  and the  songs are sometimes very
small (not even a minute) and up to 10 minutes (the last one).
This time the style of the music is not as different as of the second album.
Nearly all songs are very slow (sometimes a bit strange but anyway not fast),
except  the second  and the "Black Death" which  is a  useless  remix  of the
second one.
"Ad mortem festinamus" is surely wellknown and if you're going to a so called
"black club" sometimes  you will  know this  song for sure, at  least in Jena
they're playing it nearly all day... It's a great  piece of music  and if you
have listen  to it one time you will never forget it. I have bought the album
because of this song...
The most others  a are a bit  slower and  especially the  sixth one is great!
Very small  use of instruments, the  song lives  more of the voice of Sigrid,
cool.
And the "Jherusalem" song  is very strange. The electro-sounds  are sometimes
very strange  and really  fast but  the voice of  the  singer and  the use of
fiddles  breaking  through this  hard sound-carpet  and leaving  a very split
impression.
Ok, last but not least I will go over to the usual part, the...

[1] Un vers de dreyt nien

Farai un vers de dreyt nien:
Non er de mi ni d'autra gen,
non er d'amore ni de joven,
ni de ren au,
qu'enans fo trobatz en durmen
sobre chevau.

No sai en qual hora'm fuy natz:
No suy alegres ni iratz,
no suy estrayns ni sui privatz,
ni no'n puesc au,
qu'enaissi fuy de nueitz fadatz,
sobr'un pueg au.

Malautz suy e tremi murir,
e ren no'n sai mas quan n'aug dir;
metge querai al mieu albir,
e no sai cau;
bos metges er si'm pot guerir,
mas non, si amau.


[2] Ad mortem festinamus

Scribere proposui de contemptu mundano
ut degentes seculi non mulcentur in vano
iam est hora surgere
a sompno mortis pravo
a sompno mortis pravo.

Vita brevis breviter in brevi finietur
mors venit velociter quae neminem veretur
omnia mors perimit
et nulli miseretur
et nulli miseretur.

Ad mortem festinamus
peccare desistamus
peccare desistamus.

Ni conversus fueris et sicut puer factus
et vitam mutaveris in meliores actus
intrare non poteris
regnum Dei beatus
regnum Dei beatus.

Tuba cum sonuerit dies erit extrema
et index advenerit vocabit sempiterna
electos in patria
prescitos ad inferna
prescitos ad inferna.

Ad mortem festinamus...


[3] Anc non lo vi (Un vers de dreyt nien II)

Anc non lo vi e am lo fort,
anc no n'aic dreyt ni no'm fes tort;
quan non lo vey, be m'en deport,
no'm pretz un jau,
qu'ien sai gensor et bellazor,
e que mais vau.


[4] Por mau tens

Por mau tens ne por gelee
ne por froide matinee
ne por nule autre riens nee
ne partirai ma pensee,
d'amors que j'ai
que trop l'ai
amee de cue verai.


[5] Floris e Blanchaflor

Estat ai en greu cossirier
per un cavallier q'ai agut,
a vuoill sia totz temps saubut
cum eu l'ai amat a sobrier;

ben volria mon cavallier
tener un ser e mos bratz nut,
car plus m'en sui abellida
no fetz Floris de Blanchaflor.

Ara vei q'ieu sui trahida
car eu non li donei m'amor,
don ai estat en gran error
en lieig e quand sui vestida.

Ben volria...

Bels amics, avinens e bos,
cora us tenrai e mon poder?
E que iagues ab vos un ser
e qe'us un bais amoros!

Ben volria...


[6] Under der linden

Under der linden
an der heide,
dÉ unser zweier bette was
dÉ mugent ir vinden
schìne beide
gebrochen bluomen unde gras.
Vor dem walde in einem tal,
tandaradei
schìne sanc diu nahtegal.

Ich kam gegangen
zuo der ouwe:
Dì was mån friedel komen à.
dÉ wart ich enpfangen,
here frowe,
daz ich bin saelic iemer mà.
Er kuste mich wol tñsentstunt,
tandaradei,
seht wie rìt mir ist der munt!

Dì het er gemachet
alsì råche
von bluomen ein bettestat.
Des wirt noch gelachet
inneclåche,
umt iemen an daz selbe pfat.
Bå den rìsen er wol mac,
tandaradei,
merken wÉ mirz houbet lac.

Daz er bå mir laege,
wessez iemen
nu enwelle got!
sì schamt ich mich.
Wes er mit mir pflaege,
niemer niemen
bevinde daz, wan er und ich,
und ein kleinez vogellån:
tandaradei,
daz mac wol getriuwe sån.


[7] Rossinhol

"Rosshinol, el seu repaire
m'iraz ma dona vezer
e diguas li'l mieu afaire
et ill digue't del siue ver,
e man sai
com l'estai,
mas de mi'll sovenha,
que ges lai
per nuill plai
ab si no't retenha,

qu'ades no'm tornes retraire
son star e son captener,
qu'ieu non ai paren ni fraire
don tnat ho vueilla saber."
Ar s'en vai
l'auzels guai
dreit vas hon ill renha,
ab essai,

tro qu'en trob l'ensenha.

Quan 'auzeletz be bon aire
vi sa beutat aparer,
dous chant commencez a braire,
si com sol far contra'l ser;
pueis se tai,
mas de liei s' enghenha,
co'l retrai

so qu'ill auzir denha.

"Sel que'us es verais amaire,
volc qu'ieu en vostre poder

per so que'us fos a plazer.
E sabrai
quan veirai
de vos l'entrescenha,
que'il dirai,
si ren sai,
per qu'el lai s'en fenha,

e si'l port que's n'esclaire,
gran gaug en devetz aver,
qu'anc hom no nasquet de maire
tan de be'us puesca voler.

Ie'm n'irai
e'm mourai
ab gauc, on que'm venha...
no farai,
quar non ai
dic qual plag en prenha."


[8] Non sofre Santa Maria

Non sofre Santa Maria
de seeren perdidosos
os que as sas romarias
son de fazer desojosos.

E d'est' oyd' un miragre
de que vos quero falar,
que mostrou Santa Maria,
per com' eu oy contar,
a uuns romeus que foron
a Romacador orar
como muy b±os crisch∞os

[9] Doussa res

Us cavaliers si iazia
ab la re que plus volia;
soven baizan li dizia:
Dossa res, ieu que farai?
Que'l iorns ve e la nueytz vai.
Ay!
Qu'ieu aug que li gaita cria:
Via!
Sus! Qu'ieu vey lo iorn venir aprez l'alba.

Doussa res, s'esser podia
qu ia mais alba ni dia

Ay!
Qu'ieu aug que li gaita cria:

Doussa res, s'ieu no'us vezia,

per qu'ieu tost retornarai,
que ses vos vida non ai.
Ay!
Qu'ieu aug que li gaita cria:
Via!

[1o] Jherusalem

Jherusalem, grant damage me fais,
Qui m'as tolu ce que je plus amoie;
Sachiez de voir ne vos amerai mais,
Quar c'est la rienz dont j'ai plus male joie,
Et bien souvent en sospir et pantais,
Si qu'a bien pou que vers Deu ne m'irais
Qui m'a ostÇ de grant joi e ou j'estoie.

Biaus dous amis, cum porrois endurer
la grant painne por moi en mer salee,
quant rienz qui soit ne porroit deviser
la grant dolor qui m'est el cuer entree?
Quant me remembre del douz viaire cler
que je soloie baiser et acoler,
grant merveille est
que je ne sui dervee.


[11] Sanctus (Ad mortem festinamus II)

Quam felices fuerint qui cum Christo
regnabunt, facie ad faciem
sic eum spectabunt,
sanctus, sanctus dominus
Sabaoth conclamabunt
sanctus, sanctus dominus
Sabaoth conclamabunt.

Ad mortem festinamus,
peccare desistamus,
peccare desistamus.


[12a] Black Death (Ad mortem festinamus III)

Scribere proposui de contemptu mundano,
ut degentes seculi non mulcentur in vano.
Heu, heu, heu, miseri,
nunquam inde exibunt,
numquam inde exibunt!

Vita brevis breviter in brevi finietur
mors venit velociter quae neminem veretur.
Heu, heu, heu, miseri,
nunquam inde exibunt,
numquam inde exibunt!

Ad mortem festinamus,

[12b] Un vers de dreyt nien (III)

No sai quora'm suy ednumitz
ni quora'm velh,
s'om no m'o ditz.
Per pauc no m'es lo cor partiz
d'un dol corau;
e no m'o pretz una sauritz,
per Sanh Marsau!

Fag ai lo vers, no say de cruy;
e trametrai lo a selhuy
que lo'm trametra per autruy
lay vers Anjau,
que'm tramezes del sieu estuy
la contraclau.

[1] A song about nothing at all

I will sing a song about nothing at all:
naither about me nor about anyone else,
neither about love nor about youth,
nor about anything else,
it came to me while asleep on the horse.
I don't know when I was born;
I am not happy and not sad,
I am not from there, I am not from here,
it was only given to me by destiny,
one night,
on a high mountain.

I am ill and fear to die,
but I don't know from what,
I will see a doctor
but I don't know whom;
if he can cure me he is good,
if I get worse, he is bad.


[2] Dance of Death

I want to write of the evil in the world
lest the time should pass unused.
The time has come to awake
in the face of death,
in the face of death.

The short life soon will end,
death comes faster than you would believe.
It destroys everything
and has no mercy,
and has no mercy.

We rush into death,
don't want to trespass any more,
don't want to trespass any more.

If you don't turn back and become like a child
and you don't change your life,
you won't go into, as a happy one,
the Kingdom of God,
the Kingdom of God.

When the trump resounds,
Jugdement Day has come.
The judge appears
and calls the chosen ones to his Kingdom
but the damned to hell,
but the damned to hell.

We rush...


[3] Never have I seen him (A song about nothing at all II)

Never have I seen my lover,
yet, I love him that much
he did me neither justice nor injustice,
it doesn't trouble me that I don't see him
it does not please, as well
to know an even more beautiful one,
who counts more.


[4] With a pure heart

Neither weather nor frost,
nor the cold in the morning
and no pleasant thing, as well, can induce me
to give up my love I cherish,
which I have already loved too much
with a pure heart.


[5] Floris and Blanchefleur

I was in great pain
because of a lover who once was mine
and I want that it is known for all time,
how excessively I loved him.

Surely I would wish to hold
my lover naked in my arms for one night,
for I am more in love with him
than Floris with Blanchefleur.

Now I realize that I have been betrayed,
because I didn't present him with my love.
Therefore, I have suffered severely
day and night.

Surely I would wish...

Beautiful, courtly, dear friend,
when will I be able to dispose of you?
if only I could lie beside you for one night
and could give you a tender kiss.

Surely I would wish...


[6] Underneath the lime

Underneath the lime
and the heath,
where the couch of both of us has been
there you can see
broken flowers
and grass,
in front of the forest in the valley,
hurrah,
the nightingale sang
beautifully.

I came along
to the meadow:
my darling was already there.
I was received like a noble woman,
so that I am happy for ever.
he must have kissed me
a thousand times,
hurrah,
look, how red my mouth is!

There has prepared a couch,
so wonderful;
made of flowers.
May a one will smile about it for himself,
if he comes alog the way.
He can exactly recgonize be the roses,
hurrah,
where my head has lain.

That he lay beside me,
if someone would know about it,
God forbid, then I would be ashamed.
What he had done with me,
should never anybody
know but him and me
and a little bird,
hurrah,
will be reticent, I hope.


[7] Nightingale

"Nightingale, please fly to my lady
and describe her my situation
and she should tell you
the truth about hers;
she should let me know
how she is getting on,
and she should think of me
and shouldn't keep you by herself,
under no circumstances,
so that you can return at once,
to report me,
for I have no brother
who matters to me that much."
Now it flies away,
the cheerful bird,
directly towards her,
powerful
without fright,
to find a sign of her.

As the good bird saw her in her beauty,
it started a song,
like it is singing every evening;
then it grows silent,
stops singing
and remembers the lady
as it reports her,
without confusion.

"You're true lover
wanted me to come,
to siong
for your pleasure
and I shall know
what I should report him,
if you will.

Give me a sign
and if I should come to know something
that makes him hope,
and if I could bring him good news,
you should feel great joy,
for never has a man been born
who is that well-disposed towards you.
I will fly away with pleasure
and withdraw, wherever to...
no, I shall not do that
because you
haven't yet come to a decision."


[8] Santa Maria

Maria cannot
stand the sinners
who make
their pilgrims unhappy.

I have heard of a miracle,
I will tell you about.
Maria has performed it,
as far as I know
from pilgrims
who have been in Rocamador,
like many good
humble Christians.


[9] Dawn

A knight was lying
beside his sweetheart;
kissing her, he asked:
Sweet creature, what should I do?

For the day comes and the night goes.
Alas!
I hear the guardian calling:
Come on!
For I can see the first daylight.

Sweet creature,
it would be a great fortune
if there would be neither morninglight nor day,
at least there, where a lover lies beside his sweetheart.
Alas!
I hear the guardina calling:
Come on!
For I can see the first daylight.

Sweet creature,
if I would'nt see you,
believe me that I would have to die soon,
for the great longing for you would kill me;
therefore I will return soon,
for I cannot live without you.
Alas!
I hear the guardian calling:
Come on!
For I can see the first daylight.


[1o] Jerusalem

Jerusalem, you lay great misfortune upon me,
because you have taken the one away from me
whom I love most.
Be sure, Jerusalem, that I shall not love you anymore,
for nothing else embitters my joy that much.
And very often,
I sigh at and complain of,
so that a little more and I would be angry with God,
who has turn me out of great joy,
in which I was living.

My beautiful dear friend,
how could you stand
the great sorrow about me, at the salty sea,
as nothing in the world could ease the great pain
which penetrated my heart?
When I think of the dear, clear face
which I have kissed  so often
and have pressed to my breast,
then it is great wonder
that I am not losing my mind.


[11] Sanctus (Dance of Death II)

How happy those have to be
who reign with Christ
and look him face to face,
sanctus, sanctus, dominus
Sabaoth they will call
sanctus, sanctus, dominus
Sabaoth they will call.

We rush into death,
don't want to trespass any more,
don't want to trespass any more.


[12a] Black Death (Dance of Death III)

I want to write of the evil in the world,
lest the time should pass unused.
woe, woe, woe, the wretched,
never will they escape from there,
never will they escape from there!

Life is short and will end soon,
death comes faster than you believe.
Never will they escape from there,
never will they escape from there!

We rush into death,
don't want to trespass any more,
don't want to trespass any more.


[12b] A song about nothing at all (II)

I don't know, when I have fallen asleep
nore when I'm awake if I'm not told.
My heart has nearly been broken
because of great pain, but I set no store by it,
by the Holy Martiall.

I have made the song, but I don't know about whom
and I will sing to those one
who will carry it on to Anjou,
so that there, someone would perhaps
reveal its sense.

new album which will be released perhaps in summer...
