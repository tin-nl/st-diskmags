                                      (tested by drizzt/.tnb.)

Hi, Ladies'n'Dudes. Here  we go  with the  test  of 'Running', a not that new
game, but  if you never  heard about  it, or if you're not sure if it's worth
buying or not, this will possibly (maybe) help you.

Running  comes to  your Home on 4 HD-discs and contains a short (but helpful)
black-white  guidance (I don't  know if  there are  other  versions  than the
german one, so maybe you have to get a dictionary :). You have to install the
disx on  your  harddrive, which  should have  about  15 to 20 Mbyte  free, by
simply  starting 'INSTALL.TOS' from  the  first  disc. You'll  be told by the
program when to change discs.

After you've  installed  everything right, you can start immediately with the
first (of five) level which is called 'Outlying District'. I won't spend time
by telling  you  the  story  of  this  game,  the reason for killing (almost)
everything moving,  because  I think it's not needy for this type of games to
know  about. Fact  is,  you  have  to  walk (or run) through the five levels,
complete  2  missions each, find the exit and shoot everything that's crossing
your  way. Only  exception  are  some civilians, because you'll loose lots of
energy shooting these guys.

The  best way  of getting an imagine of this game is to think of a mixture of
Doom  and Duke  Nuke 'em 3d. even if the 3d-engine of Doom is superior to the
one used  in Running (which  features  NO floor- and ceiling-textures), there
are lots of features and items which make you forget about it.
And not  enough, the  later  levels  are graphically real good and (this is a
personal thought) makes Running look far better than Doom.
And the possibility of jumping and the many special-effects remind me more of
Duke than Doom.

The  graphics are  quite  fast,  but  I recommend (if available) to turn on a
speeder-card. I  did  play  Running  using my FX-Card at 36/18Mhz CPU/BUS and
50Mhz  DSP  and  I  was  very  contented  with   it's  speed.  But  different
graphic-modes and  resolutions  make  it  run at good speed on a simple 16Mhz
machine.

Something I'm  a little sad about is the sound which destroys some atmosphere
by  beeing noisy.  Same  for  the enemy- and civilian-sprites, which are made
using screeneye, which don't look as good as the wall-textures.

So far for the technicals...

The levels:

1. Outlying District:

   This  is the level included in the demo-version. Not much to say about it,
   except that the graphics are not very attractive...

2. The Office:

   Graphically a little better than level 1 and far more interresting because
   this  one was  NOT  included  in  the  demo-version  :-)  The  name  tells
   everything, you have to shoot you're way through a BIG office...

3. The Underground:

   This  was the first level I was impressed of the atmospheric graphics. You
   find yourself  down  under  the  surface  in "The Underground" which means
   you'll meet mean enemys and trains (don't get hit by them) driving around.

4. Science and Development-Center:

   The graphics  again  improved, they look really good! Not much else to say
   about this  one.  Shoot your way free (show mercy to those little robots!)
   and do what have to be done...

5. The Reactor:

   you have a big reactor to pump up and not much time to leave... Again good
   gfx and of course lots of action (as the levels before had as well).

All these levels are really BIG!!! So you'll spend a little time finishing at
all. You  can  save  your  game at any time you check in a terminal which are
spreaded all over the levels.

Your weapons reach from simple foot-kicks to a big flame-thrower.
Unfortunately  you have  to  find  all the usable weapons (as it got to be in
those games; so nothing new :-) and you need to, if you want to have a chance
to  survive this  game.  The  special  items  reach  from a radiation suit to
invisibility and are described in the manual.

From the  view of playability there are few things to say. It's good with the
exception that  it's  quite  hard  (sometimes nearly impossible) to aim at an
enemy, because  the  step  your  gun makes when you turn left or right is too
long to aim exactly. But most weapons' shot spreads in a good degree.

You should  play  Running  by  using a Jaguar-Pad, because the keyboard can't
handle more  than  two  pressed  keys  at  once.  So  if  you're pressing two
cursor-keys at  the same time, you can't jump which could be done by pressing
'A'. Other used keys 'Control', 'Shift' and 'Alternate' are not affected, but
'Space'  to open  doors is. So sometimes when your player won't react as want
him  to, this  might  occur  in  order  to  the keyboard. So use a Jag-Pad if
possible.


Well that's it, here is the result:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphics    :  8   (is very dependant on the level)
Sound       :  5   (low qualitiy, but good stereo-effect)
Playability :  7/8 (Keyboard/Joypad)
Motivation  : 10   ('I just want to look around the next corner...')

Overall     :  8.5 (get it if you like those kind of games!)
