                  a short information by Grey/Mystic Bytes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An advertisment  about this  club I found  in someone polish  newspaper, so I
decided to get further informations about it (even if I sold my Jag long time
ago). After  few  days  I  got  an  answer  with  a  paper mag called "Jaguar
Extreme". It  was  only an amateur  mag, but  I  was  really  surprised  that
somebody decided to do the thing like this! So I sent a 2nd letter with a lot
of questions about the club activity, and here you will find some infos which
I got.

Jaguar Club  was  created on 15th October  last year. Gustaw (a club founder)
have seen many  times an advertisment  about clubs, so  he asked himself: why
isn't there any Jaguar Club? So it's how it all begun...
Gustaw sent an advertisment to "Swiat Gier Komputerowych" newspaper.

The  club  was  founded  by  two  guys: Grzegorz  Ajchler (Gustaw) and  Rafal
Wawrzyniuk (Rafael). Up to now  there are only  15 members. Gustaw brings new
games  from other  countries, mainly  from USA and England (Telegames). These
titles can be later leaded  or swapped between the members. (lead for 3 weeks
cost about 15DM).
Except this Gustaw  is a "play-tester", a guy from a "dirt job" as he says =)
He's trying to finish all new games and he writes a reviews of them.

Up to now they released a 1st issue of their own mag called "Jaguar Extreme".
It's a paper mono-color mag. 1st issue includes:

reviews of:

- Jaguar CD memory track
- Vid Grid (CD)

and descriptions to:

- Myst (CD)
- Primal Rage (CD)

Now they are  trying to release  a 1st disk-mag version for ST, but they will
still develop the paper mag for the ppl who haven't this machine.

Okay, that's all for now... If you wanna get in touch with them, just use the
