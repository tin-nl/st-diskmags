What the fucking hell is that? At first I can't believe that Dynacore the non
active "Six Sievert" coder  has reactivated  his Falcon again to produce some
new stuff. But  now I got a file, called ZZ9PA.LZH  and  as I heard that this
little  demo-thing should be  very delirious I decrunched it and made a boot-
disk for my tiny "gabott" Falcon and it runs...
You don't  have to wait for  brainblasting  effects, erm, it  isn't the right
word, because the effect is blowing away your  brain, tortures  your mind and
your vomit  centre (erm, don't know  right in english =)... You don't have to
wait for some truecolor experiences or worldrecord effects.
Hum, after an  indian styled  hires-picture with the instructions "how to use
the demo in the right way" and a bar which displays the precalculation of the
fx, the mind-crusher  smashes on your screen. On the first view it looks like
a very simple spiral-effect, only black and white. Nothing more. But then, if
you follow the instruction and you looked about a half minute into the center
of this spiral and  then turn your eyes to the wall, the back of your hand or
some other  stuff you'll be surprised! All things distorting in a strange way
and you  have the feeling  to be  drunken... unfortunately  this effect works
only for some seconds and to get a new load you must watch again the spiral..
so it isn't a  real replacement for drugs and alcohol, because you can't take
your Falcon  and the demo to  every place, hehe. But  if you don't have money
left to go into the next bar and get your daily load just switch on your Fo3o
and load the demo.
To make this  effect much more  impressive just drink some beers or so one to
be a little  bit more drunken  and with a little bit luck you can become  the
same effect as you got  after drink out  several bottles of  wodka or so one,
and so you will vomit onto your Falcon, but I don't think that this  point is
worth to be reached, because  I don't think that it's nice to type on a slimy
keyboard =)
Anyway it's  a cool demo, short, not much design, only a little  chip-mod and
except  this crazy  effect not  more for  your eyes, but  for your brain it's
really great food!
Conclusion: the best way for non-drinking people to simulate  a heavy alcohol
            accident... and it  will cost nothing, only some time for sitting
            in front of your monitor.
