Q - Hello  Phoenix! Before  I start with  special questions just tell how old
    you are and what you're doing in your real life (job...)!

A - I'm soon  gonna be  22, and well, my  age is younger  than me as I use to
    say, I have always felt alot older than I really are, maybe  because  all
    my friends are like 5+ years older than me.
    Currently I'm back in school, studying  or whatever I'm supposed to do. I
    dropped out of this school  shit  when I was  16 so now  I'm studying the
    things I never did back then.. I dunno why though! Nothing makes sense...

Q - What are  you doing if you're not sitting  in front  of your  computer or
    jumping around in the Inet?

A - Hmm, tricky question... ;-) Well, I used  to  spend  some  time  with  my
    girlfriend I like to believe, but since I don't  have a girlfriend at the
    moment I guess I must be doing other things, like looking for a new one?
    Just being with  friends, creating (destroying) music  or  watching  some
    videos  or something. I like  industrial/goth/body/hardcore  music and so
    on, buying records and going to concerts or festivals, my  music interest
    is very  big! I recently  visited an  art exhibition and realized I liked
    this too, and I hope to visit more of these in the future....

Q - After this I want to know something about your background in computing.
    Which was your first machine, what equipment you're using today?

A - My first  computer was  in fact a 1040STFM, which I have never regretted!
    It took quite some time for me to decide which  computer I wanted to buy.
    My friends had MSX, PC and Amiga computers, I didn't  know anyone who had
    an Atari at the time. Now this might sound stupid, because when you buy a
    computer  or game console or whatever you  usually buy the  same thing as
    your  friends have, but  when I  knew what  I wanted  I could  not accept
    anything else, quite simple. I remember I  even for some  time considered
    buying an Atari 286 PC, I guess things in my life  would have  been quite
    different today if I had  done that. I was totally  clear with that I did
    not want  any C-64, Spectrum  or other 8bit computer though, I waited and
    waited instead..

    Since  the first  1040 I've owned  many ataris, the  coolest I think must
    have  been  the  ST  and  STE  computers "slightly"  modified  by  Zaphod
    Beeblebrox, those  were awesome! Otherwise  I probably enjoyed my TT most
    of all. Today I'm not using any Atari equipment at all really, but a P133
    (probably  P233MMX  when you  read this) with  all  kinds  of  equipment,
    CD-burner, CD-changer, lotsa  memory  and  harddisk  space  and  well....
    everything! I could  specify details  but this  is something which change
    quite often... ;-)

Q - Ok, and  now we  came over to  the real interesting  stuff. When  you get
    involved  into the  Atari-scene? Was VECTRONIX the first band you  were a
    member of? What jobs do you have in VEX?

A - You mean I wrote all that and it wasn't even interesting?! Blahh... ;-)
    Well, (officially) it  was. For  many years  I just  hanged  on the elite
    boards without really participating in the releasing  thing. I've  always
    been a  very serious  user, I enjoyed  working with Calamus, Avant Vector
    and Outline Art instead  of playing  games. I did some coding, mostly for
    my  own and friends pleasure though. There was no real need for me to get
    further  involved into  the scene. Then  I got into  some trouble, I lost
    modem access for about a year and when I came back again  things looked a
    bit  different, the  scene was  slowly falling  in pieces  and I realized
    something had to be done, soo... that's how it started.... ;-)
    Heavens Trash  started as  a p/h/a board  though, the first users were in
    fact amiga owners from around the world....

    In  Vectronix  I'm  according  to  Metallinos  an  allround-genious (hey!
    remember you said that? ;-) hehe...), I like  that description. But if we
    should be  serious I  guess I'm a  sort of  cracker, I  was the  sysop of
    Heavens Trash  and our  World HQ, and well, I handle alot of contact with
    people, suppliers  and whatever. I'm also  the brain behind the Vectronix
    Newsletter, if that is a merit... ;-)
    In Vectronix I don't feel and I don't want to think that people has their
    special positions and jobs, we're all in the  same boat, we work and take
    care  of what  needs to  be done  and we  share  the  honour  and success
    together. My name on a release or somebodys else, what  does it matter as
    long as it's under Vectronix label? That's all which counts.. A Vectronix
    release stands for quality, all through, and I think everyone knows that,
    and that's how we all feel about each others I'd say.

Q - Please tell us what's up with the other members of VEX, who is still here
    with us and who's not...

A - Well, for  the  Atari  it's  mainly  me, Metallinos, Hardball, Ryder  and
    Senser I think, the others are still around, but not really into Atari as
    in the old days.. There is other things to play with today you know.. ;-)
    ...and don't hang me for missing someone here now.... ;-)

Q - Can you tell us something about the PC-section of VECTRONIX?

A - Yeah, there is none... ;-) Well, there is no real organized PC section of
    Vectronix  if that's what you mean. Slippy and Jabba (mainly) are working
    on PC's and sometimes  releases something under Vectronix label, but that
    is it I think. I have done  some minor  cracks, but mostly for fun to see
    if I was capable of it. If we had wanted to become big on the PC we could
    have  been, we've  got some  cool offers  of merging  with  other already
    established PC crews (no names), but we're simply not interested in that.
    All members  are working with  PC computers more  or less though, but for
    releases it's not much... We don't need the PC scene, and it doesn't need
    us, Atari is our home! Working  with PC computers comes as a natural step
    of development and progress though.

Q - Can you tell me something about the future of VECTRONIX? Will you stay on
    Atari  till the end  or leave it  silently some  time like the most other
    bands has done?

A - It would be so easy to just quit it all while we're still on the top, but
    I guess most crews  choose to hang  in there as long as possible and just
    fade  away with  time. It  starts  with  that  you  become  more and more
    inactive and then there's no time or whatever...
    If I should  speak for myself  I don't even  use atari computers anymore,
    but I'm still  cracking for it, and I have no plans to stop doing that as
    long as there is a need... But the originals are getting  less and  less,
    and  so is  the  suppliers. It's not easy to release hot stuff these days
    anymore.... But to  answer the question, we'll probably hang in there for
    a while... but we are  definately gonna need help with originals! So keep
    us busy, contact us if you want to help keeping the atari scene alive!

Q - Becoz you're a main-cracker of the  band I want to know which program was
    hardest to crack for you and what was the first you have ever cracked?

A - Now I don't see myself as main  cracker in  Vectronix really, my computer
    equipment have always prevented me  from  cracking  games and falcon only
    stuff. So I have only been  doing utils, which  in  general  have  easier
    protections than games I like to believe. The first program I cracked was
    an early version of Everest I think, no  real  crack, just  disabled  the
    annoying dialogbox in the  startup, really lame, but that's where  it all
    started. The  hardest  program? I  don't know really... all  programs are
    different, they all has their charm in a way. COMA had a nice protection,
    I remember me and Teddy/TMC did different  parts  of it  and merged  them
    together to a combined loader. I found the serialnumber  checking and how
    it worked as  well, but I had no patience trying to find a working serial
    or make a keymaker  which would  have been  necessary in  this case. Much
    respect to Scorpio/ex-Elite for the work he did to it!

Q - What do you think  about the cracking-scene in general? Can we talk about
    a "cracking-scene" today?

A - Not much to talk about  really... for  the first  there is  no commercial
    market to talk about for the Atari, and without a commercial market there
    is not  much  cracking  scene to talk  about. But why talk? Just shut the
    fuck  up and  enjoy the  few new  releases  there is, while they're still
    coming ;-)

    What's sad though is that some people seems to want to deny the existence
    of cracking on  the atari  today, but  somehow it's  okay when they buy a
    PC?! People who are active in the demo scene especially should not forget
    that the  demo scene  was more or less  borned through the cracking scene
    once, so don't give us any fucking shit!

Q - Is there still a need for cracking on Atari? What do you  think about the
    reproaches that cracking has killed the Atari?!

A - If there's still a need? Everyone uses cracked  stuff, even the  ones you
    would  think  least! There sure as hell is a  demand for  it, people  are
    screaming  for new stuff  every day. I'm  just sorry we cannot give it to
    them as not that much software is  being released today. Yes, I would say
    there's still a need, otherwise I would have been long time gone...

    The talk about cracking killing the  Atari is just bullshit, I think this
    topic have been discussed enough really, and you can never get it over as
    some people are just fucked up in their brains and afraid to accept it.
    Instead I would claim the opposite really, cracking is what's keeping the
    Atari alive today, if there was  no cracked  software  available then the
    number of users would rapidly fade away... That's how it is! Then ASH and
    the others could try sell their programs...

Q - And when I ask you about cracking  I want to  do the same about the demo-
    scene... what do you think about this part of the Atari-Scene?!

A - I'm not very  involved and don't keep up with what's going on really, but
    I still think it's a  necessary part of the scene. Seems like most people
    are quite lazy these days though...

Q - And what's up with  the  neverending  competition?! Some  years  ago  VEX
    proclaimed that the competition is over  but today  you're talking  about
    world domination... So why you changed your mind?!

A - It must  have meant that we won? ;-) Nah, I don't  know really... I don't
    think there was any deep philosophic thoughts about it really, I guess we
    just needed something in our  nfo's  and it  sounded  good, realistic and
    provocing, blame me! We could as  well  have  used  some  song  lyrics or
    whatever which might have been better. The competition is over for sure..

Q - I don't want to  spare out a  question  to  ELiTE, perhaps  the only real
    cracking-band besides VEX today (except some lamers)... What do you think
    about them in general (members, style, cracks, boards...)?

A - For the first, Elite is not the same  group people  remember it as, not a
    single  member is left  from that  time. Today  we speak about Elite as a
    group who  is mainly concentrating on shareware  hacking, manages  to  do
    dupe releases in their own group and seems higly un-organized in general.
    They are  great crackers  of course, but  I think  they still haven't got
    over their  loss of the  today almost  legendary founder and ex-leader of
    the group, not much have been the same since then. I  guess nobody missed
    the attack  upon me  and Vectronix  from their  other now also ex-leader,
    such childish  behavour belongs  in the kindergarten! Sounds like alot of
    negative critics  really, but they are cool guys too! Pervert for example
    is a guy  I have to thank  for alot, he's  one of the coolest dudes still
    around for sure!

Q - Some words  about the  HEAVEN'S TRASH. How  do you feel without the board
    now, it was  a part of  your life for  some years  and I think you surely
    miss something now. What about future plans (FTP, Homepage...).

A - When/if I get  cable modem or some similar direct internet connection one
    never knows what could happen, perhaps Heavens Trash would be back as ftp
    or telnet only board, who knows.... Otherwise it feels good I think, sure
    it's empty  without it, feels  weird to shutdown the computer when you go
    to bed and such, but I guess I'll get used to it!
    It was time to close down, not  because of  the fact  that nobody called,
    because people were still calling, from  all over the world, but I felt I
    couldn't go any further, I was locked up and couldn't bring the board any
    further  without a  internet connection. I did  not want to see it slowly
    fade away...

Q - Next point. The VexNews. Why you decided  to do an ascii-magazine for the
    "dark side" of the scene? Why you have  chosen  the  ascii-style  and not
    worked out a real magazine?

A - Well, VexNews  is not really a  magazine, it's simply just what it sounds
    to be like, a Vectronix  newsletter! The idea  was really to announce our
    new releases and where to get hold of  them, and inform people in general
    what's going  on. Instead of  having to tell everyone the same story over
    and  over  again I  thought it  would be  better  with a  newsletter  for
    everyone! Whether  it should be  published in  ascii style  or some other
    form there was never any question about, the  whole idea was built out of
    an e-mail  newsletter, highly  inspired by  Flashback News Ageny, Cult of
    the Dead Cow, early Phrack issues  and such. If  I should  create  a real
    magazine it would be a neverending project, I would never be finished and
    satisfied with it... I'm too much of a perfectionist for that... ;-)

Q - Theme: PaCifiST. You  said that you have cracked already some Atari-stuff
    via this  emulation. Is it easy to crack with PaCifiST? What do you think
    in general about this program?

A - PacifiST itself can be a  problem as the  keyboard  emulation was  really
    fucked up in those versions I have seen. PacifiST is only interesting for
    people who  wants to play the good old ST games  or watch  the old demos,
    nothing else! But there are others, like STonX, TOSBox, TosWin and Magic-
    PC for  example. For cracking  I usually  use STonX, not  for any special
    reason, I just started  using it  and it works great. MagiC-PC and TosWin
    is better choice for running more serious applications though....

    It's nothing different hacking under an emulator than on a real atari, it
    works just the same of course, same debugger and everything. Sometimes it
    even works better as you  have more raw  power to  do  otherwise  so time
    consuming things automatically...

    I like these emulators  alot, not  only  that  they're  giving people the
    opportunity to remember the old days of the  atari, but it also allows me
    to run atari software faster and smoother than ever! Just  check  the hit
    counters on the PacifiST and Little Green Desktop sites and you'll get an
    idea about  how big this  thing with emulators really is! Then compare it
    to some of the most high frequently visited atari sites....

Q - What do you  think about  all the Atari-clones  like Milan, Phenix and so
    one. Do they have any chance today?

A - Who needs them  really? Too  much  money... Who would invest that kind of
    money in  a (almost) dead  platform? If you're considering  getting a new
    computer, get a cheap and fast PC or Mac instead, you can run an emulator
    for your  Atari programs  if you  want and  need to, it will be enough. I
    have friends  who used to run Ataris  professionally for  their business,
    today they use MagicMac and Magic-PC instead, and it works great! Besides
    this all new commercial development are taking place under Windows today,
    and if you want to keep up with it that's your best choice, and a fast PC
    is also the ultimate solution for a cheap Linux box.

Q - BRAINSTORMING! Just leave a single word or a line to the following words.

  * AMIGA SCENE     - The TRUE elite scene, I was very inspired and impressed
                      of it! I used  to hang  on some swedish elite boards, I
                      had  many friends  who were  active  in the  amiga/snes
                      scene.

  * ATARI SCENE     - Bunch of lamers... ;-)

  * BBS             - Nostalgica, and  history... the  time  is  running away
                      from them!

  * CRACKING        - Like Robin in the Hood, steal from the rich and give to
                      the poor... Keeps the small and so fast dying platforms
                      alive....

  * DISKMAGS        - A part of the scene, wouldn't be the same without them.

  * "ELITE"         - The game? ;-)

  * FALCON          - Too late, too weak, too expensive, sorry Atari...

  * INTERNET        - Powerfull resource, I could not live without it!

  * JAGUAR          - What happened to all the games???

  * "LAMERS"        - You want names?! ;-)

  * METALLINOS =)   - God almighty... cool dude and a nice friend!

  * NINTENDO 64     - Hey, good old Super Mario came back!

  * PLAYSTATION     - Sony knows what they're doing, and  they had  the money
                      behind them to succeed with it!

  * POMPEY PIRATES  - Lamers, they only did 112 cd's... ;-) haha...

  * REPLICANTS      - Metallinos has got a real metal Replicants pin... ;-)

  * SHAREWARE HACKS - It's a shame really, I don't like it at all...

  * TRSI ST =)      - Now this  is cool! Did  the infamous  TRSi also have an
                      Atari section or what?! Who were those guys really? ;-)

  * WINDOWS 95      - Not as bad as you could think on a proper machine, I'll
                      say no more..... ;-)

Q - Erm, what do you think  about  the UCM?! (btw. it  can't run  on PaCifiST
    because the emulation doesn't support overscan, at least of my knowledge)
    Do you have any suggestions for us?

A - I like  UCM alot! Unlike  other  magazines  UCM says  what it  thinks and
    feels, I mean everything is not fucking great, there's  no need to try to
    make things  look better than  they are! I'm  just sorry I have never had
    the opportunity to read UCM as it was thought to be read.
    Suggestions? Well, you  must  work on  your compability  problems  as you
    know, and already are doing  I think. Then  you should  maybe verify your
    news sources  a bit better in the future, and then I would like to see an
    option to  create an ascii  version of the magazine on the commandline or
    something. That's it I guess....

Q - Now a very ordinary question: are  there  any games, demos  or tools  you
    really like or hate?!

A - I don't spend time on hating things, if there's something  I don't like I
    simply don't  use it. Something I like very much  though is  the freeware
    texteditor QED and also the Thing desktop (which is shareware though).

Q - What do you like in general and what do you hate like hell?!

A - Something I really hate is double moral, people who don't seem to be sure
    about what they think or feel, but sure as hell has to argue about it!
    Sometimes  it's better to just shut the fuck up, you should not think you
    can come crawling back to us when  you obviously  declares your  position
    regarding some things! Now what on earth  am I talking  about? It's about
    that some people should think twice before opening their mouths!

Q - Do you have a last message for our readers?

A - As you  maybe have  noticed once  I start writing  it's hard to get me to
    stop, but  I  hope  you  thought  this   was  somehow  atleast  a  little
    interesting. If you want to hear more from me and Vectronix please signup
    for the Vectronix Newsletter! (hey, free commercial!)

Ok, that's all  for now. Thanx  for spending  us some minutes and I hope that
your band will be with us also in the future...
