After my Orneta report  in the latest UCM I reminded myself some funny things
which has been at the party. Unfortunately  I forgot to  put them in my first
report, because  I wrote the  previous  one in a  real hurry. I hope it's the
last look at this party, and my head is already empty ;)

okay, let's begin!

At the 2nd day of the  party, before the scene competitions, Van Eijk (a main
organizer) decided  to do a "Game Competition". It was a stupid idea, really.
At  the Orneta '95 party  Van Eijk  decided to  do a competition  in "Pinball
Obsession" before the  real compos. All  people started  getting sick  of it,
when  over 15 guys wanted  to play in it. I remember that a lot of people did
not enjoyed  this idea and  just leaved  the room. At the Orneta '96 party he
decided to leave this idea and we were really happy about this!
Unfortunately  at the  recent party, the  silly idea about "game competition"
was back on track. This time it was a "Xtris" competition (it's an unfinished
game in the  tetris style). All  people who wanted to get a surprise had must
play and get a lot  of points. As you could  see, I wrote about an unfinished
version. And  it was the  funniest part of it! Because this game hadn't music
and wasn't assembled Van Eijk did something like this:

- ran mega-player from acc, loaded a mod
- ran devpac
- assembled!

All people  could seen it  on big screen! What  a shame... He had repeated it
everytime, when the next person was  playing. Why? Because Xtris  has no exit
option... Besides he  was changing  the module everytime. And  the next funny
thing appeared: Van Eijk  was going back  to the TOS, ran a large module, ran
devpac and  assembled it. During  the play the game crashed and fuckin' loud,
horrible  sounds filled  the whole  room. Argh! I  hope that it  was the last
"game compo" ever!

The coolest thing  of this  competition was  a prize - Atari 2600!!! Hey, who
remember this? :))

About other nice things from the party I forgot write about:

- T-shirt (somebody  was selling  a lot of  nice t-shirts  with an  Atari and
  Quast party logo).

- Crazy competition. It  was the  funniest  thing  there. Unfortunately  this
  competition  was too late, at  the early morning so  I have had no power to
  stay there. I only remember one thing:

  Almost nude  guys were  staying on the  bandstand. Van Eijk gave  them some
  condoms and telled  to inflate  them =)) Later he got a table and leaved in
  the center of bandstand. What was later? You are too curious ;))
  Later he asked them to stay against the  table. One guy layed  his hands on
  the table =) 2nd guy must get an inflated condom and put  him between these
  2 guys (don't forget that they were almost nude, hehe).
  Later Van Eijk announced  that they must simulate a real sexual relation to
  puncture the  condom! =))) Can you  believe this?! Hehe, all guys who can't
  attend this party lost a great piece of silly time!

  The competition  won a fat  guy. He moved two  times his  big body  and the
  condom punctured in 2 sec :)))

  okay, that's all what I reminded  about this  great party... there was some
  funny things  yet, as the  situation when  Raster/CNF  played in basketball
  with Martin's sandwiches, but they are single situations... =)))

  okay, that's enough  about this silliest and funniest polish party. Hope to
  see ya all at the next edition...
