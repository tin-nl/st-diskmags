         -= Shareware stuff - the best way to support Atari scene? =-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I will try to answer this question during writing this article. Special
thanx to Mc Laser for the article "Shareware, The New Generation" in the last
UCM issue which motivated me to write this piece of text :)

Of course I agree that shareware stuff should change a bit and I have another
nice proposal. Everybody know  that it  is almost  impossible to get a lot of
money from shareware games or tools these days.
Shareware authors  usual get no more than 20 registrations (I heard that even
these 20 registrations  are a miracle). Many  of these  pals are  waiting for
registrations even  few years. I think it's so stupid still counting that you
will get more of  them... I know that you putted a lot of work writing a game
or tool, but you must look at it _REAL_.
People who  registered your  stuff are  no more  than 20. These pals together
with registered  stuff got an  information that they  can't spread it around,
it's forbidden etc.
Okay, it's  normal. But I am  sick of it, when  these authors  waiting by few
months/years  for this ONE registration. Look  only - atari scene shrinks, we
need any new release! So why the hell you can't spread your stuff after the 2
years for  example? WHY? And why all these guys who leaved Atari scene didn't
spread their  stuff? That's SICK! Pleez, don't believe that you will get more
registrations. Anyone  who wanted register your tool or game did it long time
ago...

Please, think about it. It's an excellent way to support Atari machines these
days!

Special  respect  to all these  people  who  spreaded  their stuff  after the
deadline. I mean Reservoir  Gods for example, which spreaded the full version
of their excellent God Paint proggy. Thanx pals!

okay, I will stop here... Support Atari, keep Atari alive!

                                                     yours,
