Here I am  again. This time  I'll try  to bring you  a full test of the final
version of the so long awaited Polish demo: A M O K.
Erm it's  not so  easy  because  this  demo features  loads of  weird  fx and
different techniques too and I'm not a specialist especially in English...

     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     | WARNING : This demo seems to be a problem to all 1Mb ST users |
     | Indeed it's said to be coded for a 1Mb machine but ONLY works |
     | so far on 2Mb or more Ataris !! I don't know whether another  |
     | version will be out or not so you're warned 8-(               |
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

First comes the intro. A few lines describe a tribal tradition which consists
in... killing everybody around. Erm well if you say so. Anyway I'll try to go
somewhere else for holidays ;--)
We now  hear a nice  Cube/Aggression  chip (hi pal !!) while  a blue textured
cube pops up and starts rotating and zooming too on the screen. A first flash
and a big "A" letter appears and then we are back to our weirdoo cube.
Another  letter, a "M", then a "O" and a "K", yep  you've guessed  that's the
AMOK  demo 8-). We  switch to  a golden  CNF (for  Confusion) logo  and  then
another never-seen-before effect: a kind of blue "vortex"...
A small  AMOK logo by  Vulgar and  we enter the  plasma zone: a waving plasma
with again a  strange texture. Quite slow and the colors suck anyway it's not
bad especially as it changes shapes (too hard to describe!).

By the way all the  textures used in this demo look as if they were magnified
(I guess  it'd be  too slow  with a higher  resolution) and  sometimes too it
seems  that only  every two pixels  is used  which result  in a kind  of grid
effect, again used to spare some processor time I think.

There is a blue textured  rectangle  rotating and it's zooming back and forth
at the same  time. Great!! Then  we see a  picture by  Raster  representing a
skull and  it's time for  the 3D show... Erm  I really hate this part because
the design is really shit: big slow RED objets (kind of star  then a ring...)
trying  to move  their  ass  with  a GREEN  fixed  keftales  picture  in  the
background. Gloups..... Wanna vomit? Just do it 8-)

Forget it  and move to  a kind of textured (no need mentioning the colour 8-)
tunnel. Nice! Time  for the greetings  with keftales  moving veeery sloooowly
while  white names are  shown with  different  fonts (at least  an effort  on
design!). Another cool picture by Raster, a nice little dog which seems quite
stupid 8-). We  have now a bumpmapping  which will remind you of tSCc's great
4Ko screen  except that  this one is  too dark (grey  is shit!) and there's a
trick  with the resolution  too. Ooooooh a  big red wired  framed cube set on
fire is  flying across  the screen and  then disappears. Next is another blue
textured cube. The texture on each side is moving and zooming  while the cube
is rotating and as if it were not sufficient a big blue textured rectangle is
also rotating  in the background! Really impressive!! They  both vanish as if
they had turned to ashes.

Another paragraph for my favourite effect:
...a huuge green  ring with  lightsourcing! The  French name for it is a TORE
but I really  don't know if it  means anything  in English... Anyway it's the
kind of  effect often  seen on the  wrong machine (the Puritan Creature!) and
the  ring is really  huge as  it takes  almost ALL  the screen, at  least  it
actually does in height ! Ok  it's rather  slow and only one point out of two
is displayed  but it's  so beautiful!!!!! Oh  no don't leave me so fast! Come
back!!! Erm sorry... Ok the last screen is a picture by Raster (I'm not sure)
showing a skull again with small letters: The End.

Pfouuu I've done  it!! OK now to  conclude let's  have a look at the good (+)
and bad (-) points in the demo:

  + Loads of textured effects!
  + Of course it's not "very" smooth but fast enough.
  + The technical aspect is really impressive!
  + I love the Green ring at the end (never seen before on ST!)
  + The pictures are nice (I don't really like the first skull)
  + Great chip zik by Cube/Aggression

  - Why always that loosy blue color???
  - We want more pictures!!!!
  - The 3D part is SHIT (red objects with a green background!??!)
  - Overall design  is average. It would have been easy to improve it, I mean
    REALLY (this  version was delayed because they "improved" the design, hum
    hum...)
  - A 1Mb demo which only runs on 2Mb machines ?????


Last but  not least. You  know different  versions were  released before this
one. So what's  different here? Well first some colors changed, three or four
pictures were added and they changed the fonts in the greetings part. I think
that's all. Ok it's  nice but could  have been MUCH better. Anyway this  demo
really deserves  to be seen and  kept preciously in a drawer so that you  can
show your PC-addicted friends that a ST can do it too!!!

   RATINGS
   -------

 Code :   90 % (3D objects are too slow and bumpmapping too dark)
 Chip :   75 % Nice chip but already heard before, only ripped.
 Pics :   75 % Not enough pictures !
 Design : 45 % Really really too poor !!

I would say 85% overall because I've never seen such a demo on ST before. Yes
it's quite unique  and very technical though not perfect. Get it or see it at
least once!!!
