                       BACK TO THE FRENCH ST SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the  update to my  last report about  the French ST scene and again I
won't bore you  with fucking  unfounded rumours about some great guys back in
the scene, only pure facts here and that's surely why this file is not so big
8-( Anyway some of us are still active as you can see by yourself.


ñCEREBRAL VORTEXð
---------------
Still no  news about  the eventual  release  of Hylst' huge  5 disk demo. I'm
afraid he'll  never release it unless he finds motivation and maybe YOU could
write to him:

    Contact : sorry no email or site known only snail-mail address
    ¹¹¹¹¹¹¹   HYLST aka Geoffroy STREIT
              7 rue Elsberg
              67530 OTTROT (FRANCE of course)


ñLEONARD / OXYGENEð
-----------------
This time  this is official. You  have surely  read about  Leonard project to
code a "never ending" megademo... If not, let me  tell you about the concept:
he has already  coded a main menu and some screens and then it's up to you to
bring your participation... The early versions of this  megademo will  surely
feature few screens but then more and more screens will hopefully be added in
the near  future so  that the  demo will never stop growing!! Let's hope many
people will move their ass (at last).

ñNO LIMIT CODINGð
---------------
...is DEAD!!!! Well not really. As Thyrex and me - St Survivor - are the only
active members  we have decided to start a new band called LOud! Our last NLC
release  will be our  Back In France demo. It's now completed  but Thyrex has
some troubles  fixing a loosy memory  bug! We're also planning to code little
games or demos but everything will be delayed until our demo is ok 8-(

ToXiC MaG 14 has been  released a few weeks ago  and next issue (now produced
by LOud! and TyphooN) should  be out after  the great Volcanic 4 party. Btw a
GREAAAT thank is  sent to The Beast for his incredibly heavy participation in
this new 2 disk issue (more than 70 articles but in French only sorry!). Last
but not least you can visit the ToXiC MaG online at:

ñSECTOR ONEð
----------
Let's start with correcting a little mistake I made last time. Actually FirST
isn't a member  of STC1 but  of TYPHOON (see below). On the contrary I didn't
tell you  about their  new member Exyl  who is  responsible for the cool game
Mr Boomer (there should a test of that game in this issue look for it!). Exyl
is also due to bring us an intro for the next ToXic MaG. Great news!

    Contact : write to HELLO aka Christophe VILLENEUVE

ñST KNIGHTSð
----------
You all know that  the RESURRECTION demo has been delayed. Well we don't know
much more  about it except that Jace won't give it up and that's still a good
piece of  news! Jace has  recently coded  a cool intro for the ToXiC  Mag and
will surely bring you more soon.

    Contact : Avoid snail-mail coz they live on a remote island !
    ¹¹¹¹¹¹¹   But you can either visit their nice site at :
              http://www.runnet.com/STKNIGHTS/index.html

    Or email to :
    ¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹¹  JACE aka Laurent FARGUES at Jace.stk@runnet.com


ñSURVIVORSð
---------
...are gone  in a way. After  coding the  intro of the  ST Collection 11 both
Ptif and  Telsud have been accepted as full members of TyphooN. See below for
more info.


ñTYPHOONð
-------
The ST Collection 11  has been released  and it's  really great! It should be
tested in  this issue. Next ST Collection should be out after the Volcanic IV
party depending  of how busy The Beast will be. Tyhpoon's japanese slide-show
JAPAN SENSATION has finally been released. Nothing really  great but it looks
nice (see  the test again). Very few projects except for the new members Ptif
and Telsud who  are currently coding a Tron alike game called THE TRACE whose
preview  should be  available at  the Volcanic IV. They  will also release an
Anti Pc demo at the same CP. Enjoyyy!

    Contact : the best way to get in touch with The Beast is
    ¹¹¹¹¹¹¹   surely using his email : Beast_typhoon@hotmail.com
    You can also visit Senser at : http://www.mygale.org/11/senser

    Only snail-mail to reach Telsud aka Romain DAUGE
                             15 plan du Chaffom
                             63160 BILLOM - FRANCE


    Anyway if you want to send stuff for the ToXiC MaG or the next
    issues of the ST Collection, you'd better use this address :

    The Beast aka Stephane PEREZ
    Les Hautes du Louvarou
    chemin de la garoudiŠre
    38560 JARRIE - FRANCE


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok now a final  little "bonus". I told  you last time  that most people cited
above would be at the Volcanic IV then here are a few names:

    TYPHOON : The Beast
              Senser (not certain because of his military service)
              Quest
              Ptif
              Telsud
              FirST

     LOud! : only me ST Survivor 8-)

     SECTOR ONE : Edo
                  Hello
                  ST Ghost
                  Exyl

But we expect  even more people  on Atari of  course!! Hopefully a few things
will be released  at this CP and to be honest I must say that we are all very
eager to be there and kick some ass!!!
