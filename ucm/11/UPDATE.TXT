                        -~- XL/XE scene - update -~-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After my article  in the latest  UCM about  the XL/XE scene  some guys didn't
believe me  about some words and think that I lie a bit. After that I decided
to write an update to it, with all explanations and evidences to my words.
Okay, let's begin:

First of all a very controversial thing - cd-rom.

Yes, it's the  truth that a CD-Rom exists. You can find an advertisment about
it in the past  issues of german  magazine called "ABBUC". All people who are
collecting  this mag will SURELY FIND IT. Except  this CD-Rom  thing you will
find an information about the 1st CD for it. In my previous article I did one
mistake - I wrote that CD-Rom is a normal thing in Poland.
No, it isn't, I did a mistake, because  together with covox, 1024kb of memory
I putted a CD-rom  thing. Sorry  for this. It's  true that in Poland it is so
hard to find anybody with it, but in Germany some people already have it.
(try to catch Heaven at #atari and ask  him about  this. Long time ago he was
spreading an information about this in the intros).

2nd thing - At-bus drive

As well as CD-rom it exists. First  prototype of it  some people could see at
Silesian Atari Open '95. Draco (an author  of it) was  showing  this  amazing
thing, and people who were there SURELY HAVE SEEN IT.
At the recent Orneta party Draco was installing an AT-Bus hard drive for Zbik
of Firebird. Except  him I spoke with  some guys at Orneta  party who told me
that they have a hard drive for xe machines, and they are so happy about it.

3rd thing - SID

Yeps, this is  a famous c-64 sound  chip and  is already  putted in the xl/xe
machines. Gumi/TIGHT (a famous XL/XE technic-wizard, a sequel to MacGyver .))
has a SID in his machine.

4th thing - 18 crews

About the demo scene I wrote that "xl/xe scene  is fuckin' active, there  are
about 18 demo  groups". Yeah, it's  not too much. But  if you will compare it
with the  ST scene  for example  these "18 groups" are  an excellent  result,
aren't they? Besides I wrote only about the ACTIVE teams.
Today's situation (January '98) of  the XL/XE scene  is rather  bad. It seems
that XL/XE scene shrinks month by month. In december last year we had another
party for  XL/XE users. As Sqward  told me, there were no more than 40 people
including people from ST/Falcon scene. It's not so much...
Except this I heard  that the XL/XE stuff for the competitions was so crap. I
don't know what's going on with the xl/xe demo scene, because from the summer
holidays I didn't run my xe. So it's my last article about this scene.
I can't write  anything more  about it, because I  don't know what's going on
in these recent times.

Okay, at the end I  want to say that  I did only one mistake, it was to put a
cd-rom thing to the things which are "usual these days in Poland".

                                                    ciao,
