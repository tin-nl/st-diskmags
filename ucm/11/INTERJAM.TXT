ñ                  -= InterJam '98 - is it worth to attend? =-ð
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some guys who asked me at  the #atari what  the InterJam is and if it's worth
to attend, motivated  me to write  this article. Other guys surely heard that
at the last year it wasn't a so big meeting and only a few atarians came. So,
I think  it's a  shame... Not  a shame  for the  organizers (who  did  almost
everything  what  they  could), but  for _US_. I  think that  they  lost some
motivations  and the  next edition can be the last! We just dissapointed them
so much  and we  must change  it. Probably  all of you  know, that  the great
SILIconvention is cancelled, so the InterJam is a _REAL_ alternative for us.
I mean "for us, the  last REAL  atari survivors" who  are worrying  about the
future of  the scene. Could  you try to  imagine the Atari scene withouth the
copy parties? Because I can't! It would be the DEATH for the scene...

I still believe that Atari scene can survive by many years yet, everything is
in our hands... So  let's go to make some brainblasting stuff and come at the
InterJam! Let's  show these  assholes on  PC that "WE ARE STILL HERE" and  we
don't need MMX crap machines to do something cool!
LET's KICK THESE INTEL ASSES!!!!!

It's almost sure  that somebody from  us (probably me and Modred) will attend
this party with some cool stuff. Probably Cobra team will come  together with
us, and surely with some cool stuff too. So I will repeat:

If you are  really worrying  about the  Atari scene  COME AT THE INTERJAM 98!
Let's make a great party in the SILIconvention style!

Last note: This article I wrote before an official  invitation to Alternative
           party  in  Finland. Anyway  it  doesn't mean  that we  changed our
           decision! We aren't going to the Alternative party becoz of time.
           Last  rumours say  that many  crews  showed  their  interest to go
           there. Well, we  still won't give  up! I had a chat with Ear_X/Fun
           about the InterJam and he told me that it's REALLY possible to see
           him together with other FUN members!
           Except this crew  at the  InterJam party  you will see some ppl of
           the following crews: Poets of Decay, Mystic Bytes, .tSCc., Escape,
           Inter, Foundation Two... Cobra team isn't sure because the lack of
           money (as Winio told me...). Last year there  were some  guys from
           Therapy and TNB so I believe it's possible to see them again!
           C YA AT THE INTERJAM '98!

                                                        yours,

                                                           Grey/Mystic Bytes

p.s. An invitation  file with rules for  competitions you will find somewhere
     in the recent UCM mag.
