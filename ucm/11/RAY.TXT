1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Rainer Froemming, aka Ray/Delta Force

- How old are you?
- 25

- What (or who) do you look like?
- Hmm, well about 178cm in height ca. 75 in weight, blond hair and that's it.
  If you  visit my very  old and outdated Homepage, you can view a Picture of
  me.

- What's your job?
- Hehe, of course I am  studying Computer Science at the Technical University
  in Munich. I will be finished in early 1998.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- Nearly  everything, except  Boygroups, Girlgroups, Mariah  Carey  and other
  stuff I consider as commercial bullshit.

- What are you favorites movies?
- Clockwork  Orange, Pulp Fiction, The Killer (John Woo), all  Ennio Moricone
  Films and more.

- When did you come  into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine?
- My first  contact was  in the Computer-Lab  in our school. My first machine
  was a Commodore 64. I bought  it a long time ago, I think it was in 1983 or
  1984.

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- After the C64 I bought an Atari 1040 Stf. Later I bought  an Amiga 1200 and
  now I am  working with  a Intel based PC (of course). I sold both Commodore
  Computers some years ago. I do not posess any Video-Game-Systems, because I
  consider them as boring. Only exception is an Atari VCS, which I bought for
  about 6  Dollars including  3 Games a long  time ago (because of its "Cult-
  Status").

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- I still turn  on the ST for  watching some classic Demos, as the UNION-Demo
  or Cuddly-Demo, but  not very often. Most of the time, I am working with my
  PC, where I code for the University or play Quakeworld in the Internet :).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- It started  when I bought  GFA-Basic and tried to do some funny things with
  it. There was always some kind of competition with my friend Flix (owned an
  ST as well), about who  could code better and so on. Once I decided to blow
  his GFA-Stuff away  and began  to code some Assembler Screens, motivated by
  the first  TEX-Screens I  downloaded  with my 300 Baud modem from a BBS. Of
  course it didn't take long and he discovered the 68000-Language as well.
  One  glorious  day, we  sat down  together  and joined  our forces  to call
  ourselves "OFFBEAT". From  now on, we  seriously started coding some bigger
  projects. Two other people joined; Big Alec (Music) and "i" (Coding & Gfx).
  Our first  One-Disk-Demo was the "What Time is it"-Demo, which was a Party-
  Demo that featured some very ugly Screens :).
  Beside  some other  productions, we  released the "Musical-Wonder 1990" and
  the "Musical-Wonder 1991", which  were the  best Demos we did for "Offbeat"
  so far. Shortly  after the 1990-Edition was released, New Mode of the Delta
  Force  contacted us, to  organize  a little  meeting with him. He and Slime
  (also a DF-Member), drove  down from Stuttgart to Munich and met with us at
  Flix's Home. After we showed  him some previews of the MW 1991, he asked us
  if we would like to  join the  Delta Force. I and Flix  didn't hesitate and
  joined instantly. That's the story.

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- Hmm, I don't think  I or most of the other people left the Scene. The whole
  Scene  simply  died some  time ago, because  the ST  had gotten too old and
  crappy :).

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- Crews: Offbeat, Delta Force. Activity: Coding and Graphics.

- How do  you view  the decrease of  the Atari demo scene in the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- I am  sorry, but  I don't  know anyone  who  thinks  there  will  be ever a
  "resurrection" of  the  ST-Scene. What do  you  mean  by "it  will  die out
  slowly"? Isn't it dead?  Did I miss something? :)

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- No, not at all.

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- Hmm, very  difficult. There  is so much, I can't tell everything here. I'll
  try these: the  ICC2 Convention  in Stuttgart was very cool, as well as out
  visit at Spaz of the Lost-Boys near London.

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- Intelligence, Money, Coolness. In  fact, it was part of my youth, so I will
  never forget  these "golden years". Nowadays, some  of the  stuff I learned
  from assembler-coding are still very useful for me.

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- Oh yes. I tried Pacifist some times and converted a lot of Demos. I used it
  because it  was (and still  is, I think) the  only emulator  that runs many
  demos and games nearly perfect.

3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- What situation? Atari is dead and nobody cares about them anymore.

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- They have no "spirit", as the C64, ST and Amiga had. Sad but true.

- Have you heard about Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- I can't remember about such things, sorry.

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- Sure, when the new Windows-Version will slow my computer down again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's  play a  little game. I'm going to give you some subjects, you have
to say  way do  you think  about  them. You  can answer by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

ATARI CORP.     - Jack; TOS; power  without  the  price  and  support; ruined
                  themselves.

COMMODORE AMIGA - games; demos; games; great music.

CRACKING        - illegal; will never die;.

DEMOS           - TCB rules; fun to watch, but waste of time.

DEMO-SCENE      - dead?

FALCON 030      - nice, but came to late.

INTERNET        - will change our lives.

LAMERS          - are everywhere.

JAGUAR          - luckily I never bought one.

MICROSOFT       - too mighty.

PC              - there's no alternative.

THE UNION  8-)  - is dead; will never rise again.

VIDEO CONSOLES  - boring.
