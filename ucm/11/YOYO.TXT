After ages  it was  finally released, the  first appearance  of a  new polish
coding project. Don't know  why they needed so  much time for releasing a 12K
intro but I'm happy to see it finally on my humble ST.
This little  intro had  made the  second  place on  the ST competition at the
QuaST Party '97 (also known as Orneta) and so I was very anxious to get it.
Now I'm a  bit disturbed, sorry. This  little intro  brings  besides a really
cool musix by Jess/Overlanders only some gouraud shaded vector-stuff. Ok, you
think that it isn't bad, because even gouraud stuff is very seldom  on ST but
let me say  that those  vectors  haven't the  same shading as the known. Here
they're not dithered  as in the intros  made by Griff/Electronic Images or in
the "Chaos" intro  from the  680XX  from 1993. So  the whole  thing  is a bit
cloudy. And  because  the intro  doesn't  contain  any  grafix  stuff  or the
smallest bit of design it's not the beST stuff for ST in this skinny years.
Conclusion: with the lack of design and grafix this intro leaves a very sober
            impression  to  me. The  coder  seems  to  be really  skilled, no
            question, because it's seldom that a new comer codes such effects
            as first appearance but with the style of the production he can't
            win any flower pot. Sorry.

(AS ALWAYS?) A SECOND LOOK BY ST SURVIVOR/LOUD...

Actually  this is  a tiny  intro as  it only  takes 12 Kb!! Anyway it's worth
seeing I think. This  intro was  released last summer at the Orneta party and
- I'm not sure but - I think its real name is rather "WE LOVE MR GOURAUD" and
you'll see why in a few seconds...

First - and  unfortunately - there's  almost no  gfx in  this prod and that's
quite  a shame, only a small white font  already seen a thousand times before
8-(((. The show starts with a small text and then comes the first effect.
It's a weird green distorting carpet. Yes I know it's not easy to  understand
but it's not easy to describe either!

Then it is  the main part  showing 3D objects with a Gouraud texture. Nothing
special, a cube, a pyramid and so on. It's quite smooth but the texture looks
ugly  sometimes. You'll  also see  some textured objects such as a golden bar
and a silver  aircraft. Looks nice. Another short text and you can switch off
your ST.

Conclusion: At last  the  last Orneta  demo  is here! I  thought  it would be
            bigger but the quality is quite good so... try to get it visiting
            http://wombat.ludvika.se/~ae/orneta. Btw the chip is a world wide
            famous tune by Jess/OVR: great!

                           :.......:

This is the  second release by this lonely polish coder after his first intro
shown at  the Orneta'97. But  this time he  joined his forces with Klocek and
they've founded the band SYNTAX
I don't know  for what he coded  this little intro but let me say it right at
the beginning. It's  much better as the first one and with about 6o KB also 5
times bigger, wow =)
The intro  starts  with a  simple "Syntax"-logo and a line saying "Player Mag
2". Also a cool chip-tune, made by Jess of the good old Overlanders starts to
play. After this a big vector star flies over the screen, followed by a space
piccy of very mediocre quality, painted by Klocek.
More filled vectors coming up, besides very ordinary (but horrible big) cubes
there is an  animated  robot and  after  the  line "Now launching Ariane 6" a
relativly detailed rocket flies over the screen. Good stuff.
Again a space-picture is displayed on the screen, now of a bit better quality
and after a polish vector flag the credits coming up and the show is over.
Conclusion: not a bad intro, but I miss some design. The grafix are  mediocre
            but  original. The  music  is cool  and  last  but  not least the
            vectors are at the  one hand only filled but at the other some of
            the most biggest on ST ever seen. Even if there is no overscan or
            fullscreen you  can compare  them nearly  with the  stuff made by
            Holocaust or by Legacy and OVR in their last demo (Froggies...).

AND AGAIN ST SURVIVORs MEANING...

Let's conclude with this 6o Kb intro by Yoyo. This one is much older than the
gouraud stuff but it's  quite good. First we see a screen tagged with "Syntax
Player Mag 2". I guess it means this screen was (or will be?) to be the intro
of a Polish diskmag, nothing  sure anyway... All chips fans  will burst  into
tears when recognizing the wonderful zik by Jess/OVR!! Nostalgia rules 8-)

Two or three  3D objects start  moving on the  screen: a kind of star, then a
ring, a robot  whose arms and  legs keep moving!! It's  original  even though
there's  little design  in it esp. the colors  which are  sometimes ugly. The
message "Launching of  Ariane 6" is  on the  screen  and shortly  after  a 3D
rocket flies away.
Last come a ugly  green cube and a  Polish flag and  it's over. This time two
pictures by KoceK (who ??) have been included but they really look strange...
The intro finishes with the usual credits, but why the hell did he use a blue
and yellow font? I want to vomit!!

Conclusion: Quite  nice to see... at  least once or twice. The overall design
            is really  low  but  on the  other  hand some  objects  are  very
            original  and I really  like the robot. Besides if you love Jess'
            chips then you cant' help loading this intro once in a while.
