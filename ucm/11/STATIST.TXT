{*f1UCM 11 STATISTICS{*f0

Some people forced me to invent  statistics about the contents of the current
issue of  the UnderCover MagaScene and  even if it's  hard to realise because
several articles floating into another, I tried my best.  Btw, not considered
are  articles like  this one, the news  or all  the regular  stuffs. Also not
mentioned are interviews or the Email / BBS / FTP / Homepage lists.
