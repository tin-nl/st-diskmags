{*f1HOW TO GET THE UCM?{*f0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum, this should be no problem. You can get  it on very different ways, right
after the  release of every issue. The most of the older issues should laying
somewhere in the Internet and can also be downloaded from several boards...

Ok, you can download it short after the release from the following boards:

Germany    - THE JUNCTION BBS (official german UCM dist)
           - THE SUBWAY BBS

Sweden     - ELITE'S HIDEOUT  (official swedish UCM dist)

Yugoslavia - (because of some contact problems not established so far!)

The latest issues can be found also on the following homepages:

OFFICIAL UNDERCOVER INET HQ  http://undercover.home.ml.org

DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY         http://www.kuai.se/~ae/
THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORP. http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uno4/

Finally you can order them under the following snail-mail-adds:

Germany   - moondog - poets of decay
            Eric Henschler, Weichau 1a, 06618 Weichau

Poland    - Grey - Mystic Bytes
            Michal Michalowski, ul. goszczynskiego 2/10, 80-134 Gdansk

Last but not  least we'll spread  the next issue via Email and if you want to
get it in  this way just  leave us a message  and we will include your add to
the UCM-mailing-list... but  please remember, it will be a bigger file and so
your server should be not limited!
If you want to be added to the mailing-list write to:

undercover_mag@usa.net

Last messages:

Please try  especially  before  ordering from  the  german snail-mail-add the
other  ways, because  I'm very  limited  in time and money and so it would be
very great  if you  could  include  return-postage  to your letters (for both
snail-adds ofcourse!).

Ok, I hope that the list of the official UCM-spreaders will grow even more in
the  next  time... So, are  you  interested  in joining the UCM-distribution-
posse?! Just get in touch with me (moondog)!
