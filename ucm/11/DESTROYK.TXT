                      BLIND PASSENGERS - "Destroyka"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Synthetic Symphony / SPV 1996

"Huu, what's up?" will be the first words of all the people who only know the
first album of this band from Potsdam in East Germany. Where are the synthie-
pop sounds? Why the hell they make such noise now?
Hum, I don't wrote  this words without a deeper meening. The BLIND PASSENGERS
are one of the most strange bands we have today in the german synth-pop-area.
As they started 6 years ago they seemed to be another Depeche Mode clone. The
three members  of the band looked like  Dave Gahan fans and esp. the voice of
the singer sounded like a complete copy of Dave's voice.
But then they released several maxi CDs and with the new album they lost many
of the old but very small minded fans... they mixed the old fashioned synthie
pop with some kind of more electronic and crossover elements...
But before I start I will give you an overview of the contents:

o1. Nostradamus
o2. Respect Yourself
o3. Boat On The River
o4. Born To Die '96
o5. Straight Down
o6. Dark Angels
o7. Absurdistan
o8. Don't Turn Around
o9. The Cross
1o. Broken Conscience
11. Inside Out

Because I was on a concert  of them in December 1996 I  have checked out that
they're mutated  like hell! Ok, at that time  they were working  on their new
image, without leaving  the old style completely  and they played new and old
songs too, besides  the stage  show was  a mix out  of dark wave elements and
strange jumping ups...
But I will let some single critics now to the songs...
- "Nostradamus" was  also the  opener at  the concert  1996. It's somekind of
  trash, they  walked around in  monk clothes and with candles and torches on
  the stage... good for a laugh... some strange electronic noises and choir.
  I don't like this song very much.
- "Respect Yourself"... NO! not  the song  by the swiss DJ POPO =)  the first
  crossover stuff from them! Very groovy and fast! Kewl, even if I have heard
  it too much now...
- "Boat On The River" is  of course and  coverversion (from an old Styx song)
  and while Jenny (a friend of mine) likes this song I can't understand this.
  Ok, it's a slow and again groovy song, with nice  synthie atmosphere and so
  one, but I don't liked it as the first time I listen to it in L.E.
- "Born To Die '96" is one of  the coolest songs of this album! Very fast and
  cool electronic  arrengments and very  actual lyrics about animal tests and
  at least  in my eyes there is a  second message  in this text... even if it
  goes about animals I think we're all only born to die sometimes... there is
  no deeper  sense in our  life, our only problem is our skill to think about
  it, while animals are only a part of the foodchain, hu?!
- "Straight Down" is another  crossover song but brings no special views, the
  lyrics are cool, and the  sounds are  the same mix  out of electronic stuff
  and electric guitars...
- "Dark Angels" is  besides "Born To Die" the  best song  on this album! Very
  cool  synthie  stuff, choir samples, stretched  voices  and the  inevitable
  guitars and... violins!
- "Absurdistan"... leaves  at first a light  impression of some russian song,
  up to the break  with the usual  groovy rhythms  and all  the stuff like in
  "Respect Yourself"... anyway this song leaves a split impression in my mind
  because I think sometimes he's a bit overdressed with samples and so one...
- "Don't Turn Around" is the next electronic crossover attack and follows the
  other ones without a big difference. Nice.
- "The Cross" ... don't want to leave any special words... just read above.
- "Broken Conscience" is a very slow and groovy song, with the usual synthie-
  stuff, church bells and choir samples again... not my style...
- "Inside Out" is  just another  electronic  crossover song  with some lyrics
  about fucking someone without interest...

Hum, all  in one you have 45 minutes  of mostly nice songs, with some special
kewl ones. With "Destroyka" the  BLIND PASSENGERS showing  their old fans and
also all the  other ones that  they can make real noise and don't crawling in
the  same sounds and  styles everytime  as the most bands  of the synthie-pop
genre are doing today... And, if  you liked  this album  you MUST get the new
one, "Trash Inside My Brain"... on their  new one they're  mixing electronic,
triphop, breakbeats, rock  and industrial  to a real  explosive mixture! It's
really miles better than "Destroyka" and shows that you never have to be sure
about the BLIND PASSENGERS style!
