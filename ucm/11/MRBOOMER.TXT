At  last  Sector One  has  spread  a running demo  version of their new game:
Mr Boomer. It  was coded  by their new  member EXYL and  we can hope he won't
stop here. As games  are rare I  think it deserves a full test. Btw I'm going
to tell you about the demo version, so some details could be different in the
end. The game runs on ALL Atari with 1Mb and that's a good thing.

The intro is  composed of a raytraced SECTOR ONE logo and by a colorful title
picture painted  by EDO. At the  same time  a funny soundtrack is heard. Good
start! Then there's  a little text which explains that the full version costs
45F (about 15DM) and features 1oo levels.
The menu  itself looks  average, I think  it could have  been much better and
hopefully  it will  do in  the complete  version. You  can choose between the
usual "options", "passwords", "quit", "start new game" and "infos". Of course
some of  them are  disabled in  this version. Anyway  if you  have a STe or a
Falcon you'll be able to enjoy a soundtrack during the game.

The concept  of this game  is a combination  between Bomberman (also known as
"Dynablaster" on ST) and  Stone Age. The 1o levels of the demo are shown like
the levels  of Stone Age. The  goal is  quite  similar too  since you have to
reach the  exit to  the next level (seems logical!). To do it, you'll have to
avoid a bunch  of nasty  monsters and  pick up  bonuses  while escaping  from
traps! To kill the  nasties you can put bombs here and there and like our old
Bomberman you can gain "power ups" and other items (invicibility, time, ...).
It becomes  quite tricky when  you have to get rid of these nasties who  keep
following you while you try to avoid being trapped in a dead end. Surely this
is a good  challenge and  I don't think  you'll be able to finish the game in
two days 8-).

About  a technical  point of  view: all  characters  move  smoothly  and  the
surrounding  graphics (painted by  EDO) look cute. It's  even better when you
can enjoy the cool music by DMA SC. In other words you MUST try this game!
It's easy to play but not to defeat! It has no negative points so far  except
maybe the menu design which is very old fashioned.

and now a second look by BoNuS / FUN


As I traveled  around over the  internet (great  place if you  own a Atari) I
stumbled  over the  homepage of  Sector One. These  guys are  still very much
active on the Atari. On there page I found Mr. Boomer a preview of a game.
There was also  a lot more  but this one  I downloaded to see what is was. It
turned out  to be a game of action and strategy. It's a kind of cross between
Dynabusters and Confusion (you know the commercial Absence production).
But this  game runs  on Atari  ST/STe/TT/Falcon  and clones (they say I could
only test the  Falcon one  since that is the only machine I have left ;-). On
the Falcon it runs on every kind of display (RGB / TV / VGA).

So what more  to tell, it's FUN to play. Looks nice, but the restrictions are
that it  has to run on a  ST too, so not that much colors can be found in the
GFX. Nice sound, soundchip sound and modules possible, choose which you want.
Familiar game play, if you have played Dynabusters or/and Confusion you don't
even have to read a manual, just go....
There is  even a password  function which although  doesn't work in the demo-
version is very handy in the full version.
Several options  for sound, bomb  types and so on. A nice highscore screen is
also one  of those things we can't do without, we all want to know who is the
best in this game!!!

In the preview  levels there are only a few levels to play but if you like it
and you  want to have  the full registered  version there are over 100 levels
for your  pleasure!!!!. I think  it is worth  it, loads  of puzzling fun that
will keep you busy for hours.
