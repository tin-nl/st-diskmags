Escape  are a rather  young band  from Germany, who  firstly  appeared in the
scene with their 4Kintro  for the InterCon '96 and the sounddisk "Modulation"
in jan 1997.
Since that  time they  released  a hard-to-describe-demo at SiliConvention'97
called "Sili Con Carne" and several versions  of their  marvellous  painting-
program "EscPaint". The group is mainly composed by No, who is coder and also
kind of gfx-man.
We don't  know if rumours  are right, saying  Sage of ex-Desaster Area joined
ESCAPE as coder. Up to now there is no real cooperation between the members.
At least  that's how it  seems. In the middle of november  1997, after a long
time of silence, they released another sounddisk called "MODULATION 3". There
wasn't a  volume 2, but the  coder of the  whole thing, No, told me that it's
just alright this way.

The sounds for  this disk were made by 505 of Checkpoint. You surely heard of
him  before, being  a great module composer  and  winner  of  several  music-
competitions. Well, up to  now we thought 505 is just a great musician: _now_
we know that he's the master of the scene. So lets have a deeper look on that
production....

Starting the  disk, a  nice monochrome picture fills nearly the whole screen.
It shows some scanned wires or cables that are bound together in a  confusing
manner. At the top of that picture, white letters in  times-style show us the
name of  the  production. Far below there are seven  buttons for  options. By
clicking on them, nice windows with options appear  on the screen. Those look
very nice. You can move them on screen, delete them and so on. Astonishing!
The first  one is  for music-selection, the  second for  some infos about the
tune  playing. The  third  one  gives  you  the  chance  to  change balances,
interpolation and surround-sound. Fourth for volume and speaker  settings.
Fifth  and sixth  with some  information, greetings  and  credits. On the far
right edge  of the screen, on a range of maybe 30 pixels, a beautiful raster-
effect is shown. It's hard to describe, because it's just in the way like all
of Escape's effects: undescribable.
So it will be enough if we're telling you it looks fine!

MODULATION 3 has _thirteen_ tunes for its listeners, and  you must know, they
are outstanding! The style is mainly "modern music", like dance and dub, with
a lot  of Roland 303 voices. (Unfortunately mOd  is not  that good  in modern
music, so he cannot define the style correctly ;)
Every tune is a jewel by its own. Even if the samples are not by 505 himself,
the  selection  of the  instruments  is the  finest  we've ever  heard. Great
rhythms, wonderful  melodies and strange effects. You  should  check  out the
following tunes, which are the writers favourites:

1. Beauty of the past
2. Never chill
3. No brain
4. Paradise (with its unbeatable second part)

All of the songs were composed within  3-4 month  in 1997. 505  seems to be a
highly  motivated artist! With  his  musics for "Modulation 3" he  showed the
scene that he became even  better since his  musics for the Escape's demo and
claims  the throne  of "best  tracker-composer  on  atARi". We  guess we will
listen to a lot of more, even  better (if this is possible ;) sounds from him
in the future, and we cannot await the time when Escape's next sounddisk will
be released!

"Modulation 3" is the  best sounddisk for Falcon 030 ever done. The design of
the interface  is great, the  tunes are great in composition and arrangement.
Forget those  mediocre  Independent-musicdisx, coded  and tracked  by a whole
bunch of people! Escape and  Checkpoint show the real power: two people, both
highly experienced in their functions, at their best!

Get it now or go to hell! You won't regret! Leech it from DHS'-homepage at:
