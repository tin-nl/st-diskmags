MICHIGAN MIKE is one of  the last jump'n'run  games I've seen on the ST. It's
a public domain game and because I've seen many shit on this sector on the ST
in the  last time  I was  very anxious to see  this game... and I  was really
surprised, at least of  the well drawn grafix  which can be compared with the
grafix which older budged games on ST had.
But I will not start in the  middle. In this game you must control your hero,
its MICHIGAN MIKE (good eh?) through  the rainforrest and the lost city which
was mentioned in the title too.
It's just a simple  jump'n'run. You  have to reach the  exit of each stage as
fast as possible  because your energy  decreases by  time, even if you're not
been hit by one of the many nasties.
Nasties? Hum, not in  the real life, but  here in the game every contact with
the flies, worms  and frogs (all nice animated) will cost you more or less of
your life energy.
But therefore sometimes you can find apples or bananas to increase your power
again. Also  a load  of other  items laying  around in the  levels. There are
loads of gems and so one which will blow up your score. But also some goodies
are around like immunity, energy bonus, extra life and so one.
The best  thing is the machete  which helps you a bit to come through all the
vines, because they will kill you too, as several traps doing...
To leave the single  stages you must  find the key for the doors and ofcourse
find these  doors too. There are some switches too which help you to find the
way out.
All these things could make  an irrelevant but  nice little  game. The grafix
are as mentioned above nice drawn for a  PD game, good use of the 16 colours,
even if no  technic specials are included which could have blown up the style
much more, anyway  nice. In the  intro you have  a nice chip  tune and in the
game itself some chip effects, could be a bit more, but ok.
Ok, there is no scrolling  too and  the screens  switching but remember, it's
just a little PD game and this technic does the job too.
But for what all  these stuff if the  control is shit? If you must run around
it's  no problem... but if you  must jump over a trap or so it's getting very
hard! Even if you know the trap it's nearly impossible to jump above it! Most
of the time you will smash into the spine or the swamp and will die suddenly.
Even if you're  want to train  it, it isn't possible to jump fast and without
problems... Because you'll  loose a lot  of time (and lifes too) while trying
to jump above the  traps you'll  reach not the highest level. I matched it to
reach level three and I tried it at least ten times, after this my motivation
was totally gone... It's a shame...
Conclusion: A nice styled game, but for what you have a game with good grafix
            but you can't play it in the right way. Only for hardcore players
            in my eyes and  even if there is not much other stuff around I'll
            not recommend it  to you. Just  take the  STOSSER SOFTWARE games,
            the best jump'n'run stuff on ST today... the only bonus point for
            this game is that it's PD  and you don't must spend some money to
            find out that it's shit....
