Yep, we must wait  very long for this magazine. I can  remember that I filled
out the  votesheet for  their charts  already in spring  last year or so. But
finally here it comes, fresh and free from France.
As you all  know, the mag  is written in  french ONLY! and so the most of you
will not be very interested in it but anyway it's besides MAGGIE the last mag
from  the early  beginning  which  has  survived  up  to  now, without  being
international!
Even if the  team has changed  many times over  all the years the mag was the
same and  with the  current team  it should be  no problem  to reach the next
century with  this mag, because they  matched it  again to present a magazine
full filled with interesting articles and with  a little dictionary  and some
knowledge of the french language  you should have no problems to get the main
information of the most articles.
The mag  cames this  time  on two  disx again, one  with  the  intro  and the
magazine and the second fullfilled with several goodies, like in the good old
times.
The intro  was made by  the ST KNIGHTS  this time. It's  no brainsmasher  but
anyway a  nice oldschool  intro with  some  nice drawn  grafix, light sourced
vector stuff  and the usual scrolling message. I don't know if it will run on
Falcon too.
The mag itself contains the same shell as always. You have a  window with the
text, some grafix are included in the text and  also bigger  fonts. Therefore
there  is no  scrolling  and  the  pages  changing  in  another way. The menu
contains two sides  with all the usual parts and the viewer the known options
like music, acc (!), palette changing, print and so one. But unfortunately on
ST there seems to be no music included  and I don't know if  it's an error of
my machine or of the mag itself...
Anyway the shell is ok and makes no problems in using it.
The articles  containing all topics. You have many reviews  of disk and paper
magazines, demos, games and utilities. Also reviews of  Playstation stuff and
the Nintendo64 are included.
Another point are the Toxic charts  but they suffered (as the UCM charts too)
under the lack of voters.
Other topics  are several  emulators of  ST for Mac  or PC, you can find some
news and the party report of the GIGA FUN '97, several coding tips and so one
in the mag too.
But it features also a load  of other  articles  like music  reviews, concert
reports, stories  and craptalk  stuff and last  but not least some interviews
with scene people and the usual adverts.
All in  one there are about 7o  articles included, depacked about 1,6 MB text
in french! Really not bad!
But also the stuff disk  contains some interesting  stuff, like screens  from
Leonard/Oxygene, several  game  previews, votesheets  for the  charts, coding
stuff and so one.
Conclusion: If you're a frenchie the TOXIC MAG is  a need  for you! But  also
            people who are interested in getting informations from all fronts
            should try to  get it. It's  a nice mag with a nice shell and not
            as overdressed as other stuff you can get today. The only problem
            is as ever  the strange  language  but you  have  to live with it
            because they don't want to change this point.
