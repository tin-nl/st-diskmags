           let's play a game that takes ourselves away in time
            where rules were not made with bullets and chains
             i feel so restless, is there something to happen
        something over the limit, something wild 'cause i'm bored

     As I know many of you are using your Atari's for music, and/or are
very interested in music and the creation of such; we will try to cover
just that in this and future issues a bit! I think it can be very
interesting with stories and practial examples of people using computers
for creating music in real life, and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I
do already! My thought is that this topic will be returned to in future
issues, with both more or less famous as unknown writers! Just stay tuned
and you'll see!

     If you're in a band who creates music using computers (preferably with
Atari's involved in some way, or have been) then please feel free to write
a little article for us, and we'll love to "publish" it! You can introduce
your band, tell us about how you work, what role the computers plays in
your life and whatever.... your own imagination is the only limit! Other
submissions are welcome too of course, please write something, share your
thoughts with the rest of us, or whatever!

[1] ANOTHER CHAPTER ENDS by Phoenix/Vectronix [phoenix@weirdness.com]

     So was the year nineteenninetyseven over at last, and another year
written into the history books, its been a great year in many ways! I hope
and also think nineteenninetyeight will be just as great. There's no reason
to look back now anyway, just look forward and try to do the best out of
it, and you'll see it will turn out fine! It's easy to remember the "good
old times" every now and then and think everything is just shit nowadays,
and if that's how you think, of course that's what it will be like too!

     Heavens Trash has now closed down, and I would say for good, but you
never knows. With the great development of internet today you never know
what to expect from one day to another. I got alot of "thank you for this
time", "will miss the board", "things will never be the same", "I wanna
have sex with you" (oops, that was something else!) and such letters and I
want you all to know that I appreciate it very much. Life is not over
though, rather the opposite I would say... You die only to be re-borned (in
some cultures), as we're stepping into a new generation we must adapt and
use it in a better and more efficient way, that's what we're trying to
accomplish also! Internet is the place worth the efforts of making things
available! BBS'es are simply too limited, they can grow and grow for all
eternity, but for what reason?

     We will continue with the Vectronix Newsletter as usual, I see no
reason to stop now. Maybe we must find a new approach, find new things to
write about, try to be more wide and open for new ideas, but I hope, and
also think that you as reader enjoyes to get these small little newsletters
in your mailbox every now and then (otherwise unsubscribe now!), and will
do so also on the future! We'll be very glad for help with writing though,
as you can tell from my own writing it's not very difficult or special at
all, it's all about to get some words written down, about whatever which
might be interesting at the time. Right now I don't know a shit what to
write, I just go on and on... ;-)

     The issues are coming more irregular and are smaller than usual
(atleast it seems), this could be because of various reasons. This is how
it is, the next 6 months will probably be the toughest 6 months in my life
so far, I have decided to study real hard for the first time in my life, I
must try to get a drivers licence, I want to continue to explore and
develop with C++ for Win95/NT which I started a while ago, and also to
learn more cracking techniques on the PC. I want to learn and explore more
in deep things with WinNT and Linux and network configurations in general.
(Yeah yeah, call me traitor or whatever, who cares?! Accept the way things
are or fuck off!). I also want to concentrate more on creating (destroying)
music, and I must try to get a job at the side of all this. Of course there
is still room for some atari work in this mess somehwere!

     This is not really me, I prefer to take it easy and not do anything
more than please me, so it will be some tough months for sure...
Unfortunately I know myself too well to think I will be able to keep these
promises, but I will atleast try! The most important thing is the school
and drivers license though, and some things simply has to be put aside of
all this. The newsletter is probably the first, as it takes alot of time.
But that's also where YOU get into the picture, help us keep it alive by
sending articles to us! Have I said this enough times soon? ;-)

[2] VECTRONIX FTP/WWW UPDATE by Phoenix/Vectronix [phoenix@weirdness.com]

     The number one stop on the internet, the hottest source of new Atari
software, the can't-find-enough-words-to-describe-it; the simply too sexy
Vectronix FTP/WWW site has now finally gone through it's move and will also
be updated shortly. There is not much which needs to be said really. The
need for this site was very big, and as it can be told by the hit counters
for just a few days on our temporary and tiny little x-mas site, the need
is just as big now, if not even bigger!

     Even though nobody pirates software these days it seems that alot of
people atleats likes to download them, or perhaps they're just looking at
the nice design of our pages, and somebody else is downloading it, I don't
know.... No matter what, this site is for YOU, who dare to! Enjoy! (btw,
that about nice design does not apply for this site right now, we know it
sucks, send complaints somewhere else!). The WWW site has is not updated
yet, please refer to the FTP site for latest releases!

     As I know everyone wants us to update this site more often, upload
more new stuff to it and so on; you must help us with this! We _really_
need people supplying software for us! You must keep us busy with
something, or we'll probably fade away more and more I'm afraid. We simply
can't get all new stuff by ourselves, and our true suppliers are getting
less and less. There will never be any traces to you as supplier when we're
done, don't worry about that! Contact us right away if you could consider
help us out, and keep both us and the whole atari scene alive!

[3] STATIC ANNOUNCEMENT by Ripley/Reservoir Gods [ripley_rg@hotmail.com]

                              - STATIC -

                        a game for Falcon 030



Jack stared at the back of  his  father's skull, his eyes sliding over
the contours of the fat  circle  of  gold  with  its gluts of deep and
bloody rubies, before contemplating  where  he  would embed the jagged
knife blade that he was  now  drawing  from  his  boot.  At the table,
while laughing serenely at the jests  of  a joker his mother slipped a
tiny phial out of her sleeve.  She was still smiling as she poured the
black liquid into the king's goblet of wine..
                                                          FAMILY FEUD.

The earth screamed under the  impact  of the blast.  Ripping outwards,
the searing, scorching heat-ball  obliterated  everything in its path:
the fabric of the city shrieked as  it was instantly torn to dust, its
buildings flattened like paper-cards,  reduced  to disordered heaps of
ash that would breed a  fertile  desert of nightmares and penetrating,
indiscernible death..
                                                            ATOM BOMB.

John Dee  flailed  and  howled,  tearing  at  his  rotting  flesh with
fingernails grown to talons in  the  hours  of unending stagnation.  A
host of pale figures issued  from  the  jaws  of  the single iron door
bringing with them their favourite instrument of torture.  As he cried
the single coherent word of terror,  six, gleaming, open buckles swung
towards him, like metallic serpents ready to sting..
                                                         STRAITJACKET.

Gregor Samsa awoke one  morning  from  uneasy  dreams  to find himself
transformed into a gigantic insect.  He  was  lying on his hard, as it
were armour-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could
see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments.  His
numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared with the rest of his
bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes..
                                                        METAMORPHOSIS.

The tiger paced back and forth, watching its long shadow slipping over
the bars, before being forced to  turn  and begin again.  The sores in
its mouth gave out a continual  pain,  which increased when it bent to
try and chew at the unyielding, metal  bars.  Tufts of orange fur were
caught on their rough, bloodied  edges.   Beneath  the fur on its body
the tiger was covered  in  the  scars  of  its  trainer's whip and the
bruises of its own  desperation.   Slowly,  methodically, she began to
beat herself against the bars..
                                                                 CAGE.

Tommy Hinton's scar sneered at me  as  his mouth formed then spat each
syllable of my name.  I felt the moisture of his breath hit my skin as
he drew nearer.  I could hear  his  knuckles creak as they were tensed
beneath their taut covering  of  skin.   "It's  time  to  settle a few
scores," he said in a voice as cold as ice..
                                                              EVEN-UP.

As we walked past,  we  all  noticed  the  anonymous  man  in the dark
glasses, standing at the corner of  the avenue.  His furtive flicks of
the head  not  only  suggesting  he  was  nervous,  but  even  acutely
paranoid.  10 minutes later, having  walked  a  few  miles up the same
road and seen the same man walking down towards us, so were we..

                                                         DOPPELGANGER.




                             S T A T I C

[4] THE NETWORK MAGAZINE by PJ Dynamix/Comic Pirates [pj@scene-central.com]

" Just a snowflake or a growing snowball? "

     For those of you who haven't heard of Network, have a short
introduction. Network was once a famous disk-magazine on c64 during 1992
and 1993. Private issues caused the team to release the last issue (#06) in
august 1993.

     In march 1997 the old creators of the Network magazine first visited a
party after the four years break. We used to go there to see what chance
there is to return and what our mission would look like. People from
different scenes filled our questionary, which was made to get the idea
what people are doing nowadays. It turned out that a lot of people are
interested in not just one scene! So we used to walk through the rooms to
get some more impressions and we noticed that a bunch of people were
talking about the coding on atari. (Some people I knew from that bunch are
on amiga...)

     With the final competition of that party it was more than clear:
"We're going to create a scene-central. A magazine for all demoscenes - the
(new) NETWORK magazine." We've started in may 1997 with coding and released
the first edition on 01/01/1998, entitled Network 01/98.

So, what's the general idea of NETWORK?
We want you to work with it, read it, use it, share it.
We want to give you a chance to have several scenes issues on one site.
We want to give you a chance to release your news without delay.
We want many little parts become a big thing.
We want to be different.

     How does that look like? NETWORK is a growing team of currently 73
editors from different scenes and for sure you are invited to become the
next. Everything in NETWORK is editable online and released immediately.
NETWORK's content isn't stuck to an edition. Articles and News come and go.
An edition (starting each 1st of a month) brings in a new design, new
music, a new Editorial, a new Network Special and a fresh Last Words.

     The plattform is there. Do not sit on your news - spread them and make
the NET WORK for you!

[Your daily fresh magazine!]

     Andreas David

[5] SLIPPY IN PROFILE by Slippy/Vectronix [slippy@du.gtn.com]

     Hi there, SLiPPY on the keys ... Phoenix asked me to write sum stuff
about me and my actions I´m doing or have done in the past. For those of
you who don´t know me by now, I´m a "former" member of a kewl and really
famous demo-crew on good old ATARI ST/F030. I did some intros and demo-
guestscreens for several megademos and trackmos, being busy since 1989 on
the scene ! Why did I say former ??! Well, because many of the members of
this demo-crew went to VeX and demo-coding times on ST are PAST for me !
It´s been a really kewl time when we´ve been active on the scene (we really
ruled, and that´s been honour for us all *grin*) ...

     On the other hand I´ve been very busy with cracking (first it´s been
demo-protections ... and believe me, sometimes they´ve been really (!) hard
to crack) ... later on I did some little game-cracks, first for my own fun,
but later on for OUR fun. That´s been the time when I joined in Vectronix
!!! Time slips away, I did some cracks and one day, my beloved ATARI went
to heaven (some short-circuit stuff) :( So, I had to decide what to do
next...

     well, I bought the fucking wrong machine ... You know, what I mean ...
a motherfucking P90 with 16mb ram and some 850mb-hd stuff ... It´s been
really expensive by the time, I bought it. That´s been around spring ´95.
As I changed the system, it´s been a real pain in my ass. Nothing has been
as it was on ATARI. Believe me, coding 68000 assembler and coding some
Intel-blurp are really two worlds. So when I got this PC, I coudln´t code
on it, except in some C++ or Turbo Pascal.

     The problem I´ve had: I had no compiler for that ... :((( Time slips
away with playing stupidous games and crap, looking demos but being very
inactive these month. Then finally I got sum compiler and began to code on
PC (*wurk*). First of all I did a portation of a funny demo from ATARI to
PC. Then I coded some BBStro´s and later on I began to crack sum
serial-numba stuff on PC. (refer to our site and leech the cracks).

     Nevertheless I didn´t just idle on PC. Nowadays I´ve my own homepage
(visit http://slippy-cyberworld.home.ml.org) which has the topic of
emulation on PC. You can get some emulators and the ROMS for the emus on my
site. Also I´m busy in webdesign and 3D-Graphics (with 3d-Studio). For all
of you who have 3dsmax 2.0, pls leave me an email. I need it badly !!!! :)
I´m just busy in coding JAVA and JAVA-Script stuff, and doing prof.
webdesign. Anybody who needs a nice-looking webpage, please contact me,
too !!!

Emulation on PC considering my homepage
=======================================

     My favourite emulator is (how could this be ?!) PacifiST, the worlds
greatest ATARI ST emulator for DEMO-Stuff and games ... It´s nearly perfect
and I even can code on this emulator in 68000 assembler. This is really
GREAT ! Also a great emulator is STonX (also available for DOS, now !) by
Griff of Inner Circle. You can leech emulators for MAC, ATARI ST, ATARI XL,
C64, CPC, Sinclair, SNES, NES, Game Gear, PC Engine, Sega, Sony
Playstation, Nintendo64, MAME (multiple arcade emulation) and the ROMS or
disk-images from my site.

The near future
===============

There should be some new sections for:

 -Hacking
 -Phreaking
 -Carding
 -Cracking
 -Serial Numbers
 -Emulation
 -Scene related stuff
 -demos for ATARI, PC
 -and perhaps even more

     ... on my site... So check it often !!! :))) I´m looking for some
Webspace provider who offer CGI-BIN stuff (for free) :)) Bah, I hate to
make this advertisement crap, but I need some hits on my page *grin*

     Okay, pals... hope you´ve got some infos about SLiPPY of VeCTRONiX!
now. For all of you who´re on #atari on IRC: It seemed to be, that I´ve
been very unknown by you, could it ??! Just a few ppl who just remember me
!! :)

[6] PARALLEL COPY RELEASE by Phoenix/Vectronix [phoenix@weirdness.com]

VEXPCP30.LZH   528355  PARallel CoPier v3.01 (c) Petr Stehlik [1/1]

     PARCP stands for PARallel CoPy. PARCP allows you to connect two
computers by parallel cable and copy large files or even whole drives
across the cable. The main advantage over serial network is the SPEED of
transfer - PARCP can copy files faster than 105 kB/s! (that's more than 6
megabytes per minute) Another important thing is that PARCP runs on both
Atari ST and IBM PC and supports all main multitasking operating systems
including MultiTOS, MagiC, Linux-ix86, OS/2 and Windows95.

     Version 3.01 of PARCP was finally released, and if you need to
transfer alot of files between different computers, for example from your
Atari to a PC or the reverse, this is really the ultimate way! The new
fullscreen, and very easy-to-use user interface, similar to Norton
Commander and so familiar to millions of people, will make this otherwise
so boring and complicated task totally painless...

     This is the perfect tool for all of you who maybe needs to transfer
your complete old atari harddisk to the PC for use with PacifiST or some
other emulator, and I advice you to check it out now! You will not believe
how powerfull this little babe really is until you see it! And then I think
you should throw the cracked version you've got in the garbage and register
it legally instead!

     For more information, screenshots and everything you might need, check
out the official PARCP homesite below...

[7] MONSTER VOODOO MACHINE by Stacey J Hoskin [ryder_vex@mindless.com]

     I bought my first Atari, a 1040STF, during my second year of college,
back in 1992. At the time, I was heavily into sampling and industrial
music. I had an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard, and an Alesis HR-16 drum machine,
and for a long time, I was using a nameless sequencer program that I found
on a BBS (and had to download with my 1200 bps modem!). At this time, all I
had in mind for my Atari was a bit of word processing, and a lot of MIDI
stuff. Then, I began to look around on some of these bbs's and found the
secret world that we all now know is there. Of course, they had to wait and
see if I was a cop before they exposed their clandestine operations to me.
I soon realised that nobody even cares if anyone is pirating Atari
software.

     First thing I did was download a hacked copy of a program called
MASTERTRACKS Pro, version 3. something. I thought this program was the bomb
for a long time, and looking back, I cannot believe it. I suppose just
having two MIDI instruments meant that I didn't need more than that. But I
kept adding things to my MIDI setup, and soon I had also acquired the 1040
STE w/4 megs that I still use today. Also around this time, I joined a band
called MONSTER VOODOO MACHINE, and began to work a lot with them. I was
writing a lot of material at home, using Mastertracks, and taping the
demo's for the guys to hear. Most of it was a little more 'experimental'
(for want of a better word) than they were looking for, but often a song
would be written around some of the basic loops from the sampler.

     I sold my Mirage and HR-16 (ARRRGH!! A word to the would be wise:
Never sell gear. Just get more and more) and bought the Peavey SP and SX
sampling combo, and also got a Roland MKS-30, and a Roland Alpha Juno 2.
Most of the time I would sequence things and make loops out of them, tape
them, then re-sample the entire thing as a loop, just so that I only had to
take some of my gear to rehearsal.

     Early on in the game, I realized that I was not always looking around
for the newest, the biggest, or the best gear. I was hunting through pawn
shops and Mom and Pop music stores in rural areas, looking for great deals
on old gear. To anyone just getting into MIDI, I would totally advise them
to save their money and buy an Atari instead of a shiny new supercomputer.
With the money you save buying the Atari, you can have a lot more cool,
vintage gear. As for me, since I have to save for months before I can
afford new gear, I stick with the Atari and buy cool new and used machines,
like my Novation Drumstation.

     I was with MONSTER VOODOO MACHINE for about a year and a half when
things started to get interesting. We were based out of Toronto, Canada,
and would open up for bands like Quicksand, White Zombie, Kyuss, and Rage
Against the Machine, when they came to town. Soon we had attention from
some major labels and we ended up on RCA records, in the USA. I look back
on this moment as the beginning of the end. We probably would have stayed
together longer had we not signed a deal with a major ( or maybe just not
with RCA).

     We got an Alesis D4 that we used in conjunction with triggers on the
drums live, so that the live drums had a little more 'ooomph'. I also
destroyed my Alpha Juno on tour, and replaced it with a very sturdy Yamaha
DX7. For MVM's live show, we used DAT tapes, the D4 and I also triggered
samples live. As songs were written, if it looked like a song was going to
have a lot of drum loops on it, I would sequence the backing tracks using
Mastertracks then record the backing track to a D.A.T., so the drummer
could follow it as he played, and the song would stay in sync. I had
thought about taking my STE out on the road and running it as a 'live'
sequencer, I knew it wouldn't survive a tour across Canada or the U.S.A.

     I was in the band for a few more years and toured with bands like Life
Of Agony, Carcass, Fear Factory, Pigface, Fight, and Marilyn Manson. Along
the way, we also won a Juno award (like a Grammy, but it's a Canadian
award) for 'Best Hard Rock album'. All in all, I made a lot of friends, and
did a lot of travelling, and I guess that makes up for the rather poor
experience with a major record label.

     One of the things that I am still amazed at is how prevalent the Atari
ST still is in the music industry. So many European bands, especially (I
hate this term, but it blankets a lot) 'electronica' projects, are using
ST's because they are cheap, they are dependable, they are MIDI ready right
out of the box, they are cool, they are vintage gear. Using a sample editor
program like AVALON on the ST is amazing because, well, to put it plainly,
the ST doesn't have the processing power to do things like an accurate time
stretch, or pitch shifts, or things like that. What I am saying is that the
ST, with the right software, can give you sounds that a new computer can't,
because a new MAC or PC is too accurate! I believe that the Atari line of
computers, especially the ST, are going to be considered a classic piece of
gear just like any other vintage equipment, like a Roland TB-303, for all
of the reasons I have already listed.

     Currently, I still work on music , though it is largely electronic
based and I rarely work with other musicians. My current gear list is as
follows:

Atari 1040STe with 4 megs, color and mono monitors, 85 meg hard drive.
Cubase Audio 1.06
Avalon sample editing software v 2.0
Zero X sample editor
Anatek SMP 7 MIDI patchbay
Novation Drumstation
Roland MKS 30
Ensoniq Esq-M with a special upgrade featuring SQ-80 waveforms
Peavey SP (2.10 op sys -- reads AKAI sample library)
Peavey SX II
Alesis D4 and KAT drum triggers
Roland PC 180 MIDI controller Keyboard 2
Realistic 'Stereo Disco Mixers' (with a total of 6 stereo, 4 mono inputs)

     I am a big fan of the Steinberg software for the Atari computer, but I
hate those goddamned cartridge keys for copy protection. Even though I own
legit copies of Avalon and Cubase, I use hacked copies because I hate
exchanging cartridges all of the time, and the adaptor that exists for key
sharing cannot be had cheap, because Atari owners that sell their gear to
upgrade to a so called 'better' computer system almost always want too much
money for the stuff (at least in Canada).

     I am at present working on numerous projects; one is just as a remix
producer, one is a hip hop collaboration with a great vocalist, one is a
very atmospheric project with an amazing female vocalist and a talented
guitar player, and I have written numerous breakbeat, trance and house
instrumentals that I would like to release in the near future.

     I'd like to also write about the art of shopping for cheap MIDI gear,
more Atari stuff, and maybe tell a road story or two about Marilyn Manson
if the boys at VECTRONIX want me to..? (of course we want him to! stay
tuned for more interesting reading from this guy! /phx)

[8] ELDSLANDET J™NK™PING by Phoenix/Vectronix [phoenix@weirdness.com]

     One of the authors behind the fabolous Zero-X sample editor software,
more precisely Peter Segerdahl will be playing with his band Novelty at
Eldslandet, J”nk”ping/Sweden on the 21:st of February! (hey, that's my home
town! /phx). Novelty plays pure happy synthpop music, but they are very
good, and they will leave no one into this kind of music dissepointed!
Afterall, they have the most superiour music software behind them, so what
could possibly go wrong? ;-)

     There will be four bands playing this evening, only two more is ready
at this time, and that's a local band called Blind Vision. This is also
synthpop music unfortunately (is it obvious that I'm not that glad about
this pop kind of thing? ;-) hehe...), but they're also very good! And then
there is a for me totally unknown band by the name Transparent Blange, I
have no idea what this is. The last band is not decided yet, and I will say
no more until it's final. So in other words, if you're into this kind of
music, stop by in J”nk”ping on the 21:st of February, I will be there for
sure! If you want more details, mail me in a week or two and I will know
more. The entrance fee will be 70 SEK and first band on stage around 8pm!

     While you're waiting for this event to happen, please visit the
Novelty homepage! You'll find information about the band as well as some
audio clips in MP3 format which are available for download. So even if you
cannot be in J”nk”ping on the 21:st, atleast you will be able to have a
preview of how they sound like, before you buy their new CD! ;-)

     The full length CD in question which is called "Natural" is available
from Hot Stuff Records in Sweden, and from A Different Drum for american or
international orders, see addresses below! "Natural" has recieved good
critics and reviews in swedish synth/industrial magazines, it's very well
produced and you can hear that these guys knows what they're doing! This CD
should be a must buy for all synthpop minded people out there! If not else,
buy it anyway... and you might learn to like it! ;-) If you can't find it,
contact me and I'll help you!
