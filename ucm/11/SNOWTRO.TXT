In  december  1997 RESERVOIR GODS, makers  of serious  British  disk-magazine
MAGGIE and of those great GODBOY-releases, published their first product that
could be called "some-kind-of-demo".

THE SNOWTRO XMAS DEMO is about 1MB in size. The  README.TXT about the demo is
really worth reading! It's typical RG-humor, and I like it.
The demo starts with a violet RG-logo, whose  letters  are scrolling from the
left and the right of the screen. The logo looks - to be honest - shit, it is
a bit disproportioned and the colors are  just ugly. Now snowflakes come from
the top of the screen, all of them in size of maybe 10x10 pixels.
They disappear behind a white "landscape" that  is shown at the bottom of the
screen. The RG-logo now is white at its  top, but this  looks even worse than
the normal logo, due to the unprofession al usage of antialias.
Sorry guys (girl? (Ripley?)).
At last  the RG-logo  disappears  on the  screen, scrolling  down  behind the
landscape.
As next, a red silvester-crack appears on screen. It has a atARi-symbol right
in the  middle, but doesn't look good. The cracker explodes and a banner with
a funny saying  appears on it. Those  sayings are different everytime you run
the demo. Here are the reviewer's favourites:

1. How Does Axe Of Superior Get So Much Into His Stocking? By Packing!
2. What Do Vectronix Always Bring To Christmas Parties? Cracker!
3. What Did The Coders Wife Want For Christmas? A Dbra!
4. What's Agent T's Favourite Christmas Food? Mince Spies!
5. What's The Best Demo To Watch This Christmas? Snow-Nolu-Mineszenz!

Really funny stuff and a cool idea! And again  some snowflakes are falling to
the ground. After  that, a "Merry Xmas"-logo appears on screen, coloured red.
It isn't antialised and could be done better with each raytracing-program. In
its background, some  parcels and xmas-trees are shown. In the lower border a
normal 8x8  scrolline starts, telling  some xmas-stories and a whole bunch of
greetings. You  surely recognized  this scrolline  in some  issues of  MAGGIE
before.

The end with the credits, viewed by a small font in a very plain way. Finally
a quite good looking RG-logo appears, but  it is too  much antialiased again.
A laughing voice finishes RG's XMAS-demo.

The  whole  demo  goes  hand  in hand with  a  tune  by MSG, playing  several
xmas-songs.

Well, it's hard to say anything  about  the quality  of this demo. On the one
hand, it is RESERVOIR GODS' first real step into democoding and a typical RG-
styled  production. On  the other hand such stuff cannot  compete  with other
"real" demos  and looks a bit poor in comparision to them.
So let's  say it like that: a nice  try of RESERVOIR GODS to show people they
are still there, but not worth showing your scene-friends from PC or aMiGA...

Final note : Ohh, I  already  hear a  lot of people, esp. from  the UK, being
             raged about  this review! But HEY! Be  objective  and look  what
             RG's did! So  please  don't write  mails to me, telling  me your
             infuriation about this text. (as it happened in former  times of
             UCM) I don't mind about it and I like to be objective.
