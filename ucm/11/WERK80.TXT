{*f1ATROCITY - "WERK 80"{*f0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

produced by Swanlake Records / Massacre Records 1997


As I saw several adverts for this album in the german gothic-magazine ORKUS I
was sure that I must get this piece of music and now I have it...
But if you  think it's an usual  gothic-metal album you're so wrong. The guys
of ATROCITY have  covered a  load of  great pop  and new wave  songs from the
eighties and this is very strange! All songs came along with a new sound like
massive guitars  and drums, but there is no problem to find out which song it
is, cool!
On this album you will find the following songs:

o1 - Shout                    (original by Tears For Fears)
o2 - Rage Heart               (original by Franky Goes To Hollywood)
o3 - Wild Boys                (original by Duran Duran)
o4 - The Great Commandment    (original by Camouflage)
o5 - Send Me An Angel         (original by Alphaville (?))
o6 - Tainted Love             (original by Soft Cell)
o7 - Der Mussolini            (original by DAF)
o8 - Being Boiled             (original by Thomson Twins (?))
o9 - Don't Go                 (original by Yazoo)
1o - Let's Dance              (original by David Bowie)
11 - Maid Of Orleans          (original by OMD)
12 - Die Deutschmaschine      (original by And One)

Yep! All great songs of our youth =) and real classics! But I will start from
the beginning.
I have the  digipack for testing and on this CD is with "Die Deutschmaschine"
a bonus-track.
The whole thing is very cool styled, with nice  looking girls  in leather and
latex outfit, without giving offence (for the prudish people out there).
Besides  the repeatedly  cover  you have  also  a poster  as booklet with the
girlies from the cover... =)
Because I like all those songs in their oiriginal version I like those covers
too, because they're using the original melodies and the metal influences are
not to big. The  more  aggressive songs  like "Wild Boys" are a bit harder as
the others. The most strange songs are "Tainted Love" with massive  stretched
and dark voices and last but not least very strange  synthie-sounds, not only
hard guitar thunderstorm. Anyway its one of my favourite songs on this album!
Another strange dance floor smasher is "Der Mussolini" with the  crude lyrics
and the fastest rhythm on the whole album.
Also good  songs are "Shout", "Rage Heart", "The Great Commandment" and "Maid
of Orleans". The last one is in my ears a  bit better and not as schmaltzy as
the  original version. Some  of the  songs  feature  also  the  voice  of Liv
Kristine Espanaes  and if your  knowledge of gothic is a bit  better you know
that she gave their great voices to the band THEATRE OF TRAGEDY.
With their great, clear and high voice she gives the songs some more style!
All in one it's  a great album  and even if you don't like metal so much just
spend some minutes at your record-shop  and take  a hear at it! It's  no pure
gothic and there are no grunt voices, and besides the guitars and so one also
violines were used (sampled, but anyway it sounds fucking cool!).
So if you're  an surviving  eighties-fan  and open for new influences just go
and buy this great piece of music!
