Hello gamblers! (d)Ev!ls t0Y is writing again some shit...

Because I don't  get a right  idea what  I should  write this  time for you I
thought 'why not make a flashback to the good old times of gaming on ST?' and
so I did it... Here it comes, the...


                           _F_L_A_S_H_B_A_C_K_


The main reason for writing this articles is that I got Skinheads Pirate Gold
CD ROM with  about 15oo games (!) for  ST and STe... There  are tons  of real
rare and seldom games  included on this compact, besides the usual smash hits
and some real  goldies. Today I want to write something about two games which
I depacked at first after I got this CD.
But let me  point out that I wanted to  write originally  a review of the ST-
version of 'KiLLiNG iMPACT' which  had never found  the way to Germany so far
as original software. I already  got a copy from the ELiTE crack but it never
runned on my ST. Because I thought it could  be that there were some problems
by copying the  two disx I didn't wrote  something about it and now I got the
CD from Skinhead (or better an 'illegal' copy of the CD, hehe) and  what? The
game  was also included and  didn't run on my ST again! Don't know  whats up,
perhaps the crack is shit, or shit packed or whatever! Hey ELiTE guys! Try to
make perfect running  hacks! Its  dull to release  a game  which  doesn't run
anymore after cracking! Perhaps there is another crack of the game around and
I get it in time  becoz I  think  its worth  to be  reviewed. On  the ST  its
called 'Gladiator'. So if you have a running copy try to get in touch with me
if you  don't want  to write a  review of the  game for this zine! Perhaps we
can swapp some more warez too?!

The first one  I played many times  on my Amiga about 6 years ago and I liked
this game very much... its called 'THE GREAT GiANA SiSTERS'! Yeah!
Ok, some of you will say that this game is just a loosy ripoff of SUPER MARiO
from the NES but  anyway I like it much  more! I have played  the original on
the NES too, but in comparison with 'GiANA SiSTERS' it was only shit, I don't
know why...
Ok, some  facts at first. This game  was released back in 1988 by the company
Timewarp. The makers of the game were  wellknown on the  ST games sector some
years later... ever heard of Jochen H!ppel (gr!n). On the CD you'll  find the
trained version made by B.O.S.S. (do you remember this guy?)
So whats up  with this  game? Its just the same  as the game with the plumber
called Mario, also the most  levels have the same  style. The only difference
is that you're running around as a little girl.
Of course several other things  are changed and so  there are other monsters,
the specials brings other effects, so you're not growing and therefore you're
mutating to a punkgirl, nice idea indeed.
Because I think you've  already played this  game on several machines or just
the clones (STario, the Godboy  and Godlenes versions) I  don't want to write
anything about the game itself... for the  not so  skilled people: its a very
simple but funny jump'n'run game!
Hum, just let me take a look at the technics. I must say it  at first, you'll
notice right at the beginning that the game is 10 years old! Even if it looks
like the  Amiga version and  of course (?!) sounds also as this one, you will
see it at the menu  and in the game  itself. There are tons of games released
after GiANA SiSTERs and  since jump'n'runs like 'FiRE & iCE' the old ones are
totally outdated. There is only one point  left to play this  games again and
again, they're nostalgic, some  memories of  our first  nights we have played
through. And sometimes they  make some fun  which was never  reached again by
later games, which are styled like hell but horrible gameplay.
And so GiANA SiSTERs has  the same bonus as also MARi0, the games like BUBBLE
B0BBLE or just iNTERNATi0NAL KARATE. Even if all those  games are  looking so
horrible today, they're  funny and when  you get the  stick to play them some
kewl memories  coming up and as we all know  you're remembering only the good
times, or at least you're trying to do this.
And so was it again as I got the CD. After I  found this game at the index of
the CD I  was depacking it  as fast  as possible. Its  one of the hundreds of
games I had for the Amiga which I remember today, besides 'PP HAMMER', 'G0DS'
and 'TURRiCAN 2' ofcourse, and last but not least 'SHERMAN M4'.
But back to my  depacking effort! After I depacked the ZIP and used the MSA I
got very slimy fingers, just got the Joystick and rebooted the machine... and
it runs! Oh my God! Where are these times?!
But even if  all seems to  be the same, except  the sound in the menu and the
game itself (just  some MadMax chip musix), but as I was running to the right
side of the  screen it doesn't  scrolled  and than  jumped just a bit. Huuuh!
Its just  one of the lame conversions! Its  the same as for many other games,
while the grafx are mostly the same, the  technix, mainly the scrolling, does
not survive the  converting  procedure, sniff. Its  just a shame, even  for a
game from 1988. And  this was the point  for me to switch off my machine. But
only for  some minutes  and then  the real  mood of the  Atari freak breaking
through, just to like a game even if its not as good as on other systems!
Yup, we were sometimes proud that we could play all the games on our machines
too, even if only a few really reached the quality of the original versions.
Anyway after  some mournings about  the fucking 'scrolling' I played the game
again and again and I don't wanted to play 'STario' or the emulations on F030
again instead of it.
Last but not least this game features also a two-player mode!
So I will last  but not least  give you my  ratings in comparison  with 'new'
games on ST: grafix  - hum, simple, doing their job, but not even a bit state
                       of the art, would say 4/10
             musix   - kewl digisong  in the intro, several chip musix in the
                       game itself, erm, don't like MadMax so much, 5/10
             control - easy to handle, no more words to loose, 8/10
             fun     - yep! even if its  a simple game it makes fun like hell
                       and you will play it again and again! 9/10
             conclusion - even if the technic  isn't up to  date anymore, the
                          game has its very special attraction! Get it!

Ok, I will  write more stuff  next time, because  of the kewl CD I have about
1500 games and I'm sure to find the one or other nice thing on it.
