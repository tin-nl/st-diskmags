Hello folks!

"Better  late than never" should  be our  fave saying now... I  know, we have
confused the whole scene with all the announced release-dates.
Sometimes you could  read something about  middle of March, April and than at
the end of February. And now? We have the first days of March...
The reason for the earlier release-date should be  clear: we got already tons
of  articles in  time and  it's senseless  to wait longer. We  only wanted to
entertain you as fast as possible.
But with the last deadline (21./22.2.) we got some problems. The shell wasn't
ready before this date, several  important articles were  still not enclosed,
and because of many private  stress I don't had the possibility to finish the
mag right after this weekend.
As I got the  new shell I noticed that I had deleted the sources to build the
DATA-file, grumpf... and  another week  passed by. As  I got the sources last
weekend I tried to find out something about the new shell and was confused by
all the headers and  because EARX don't  had informed me  right about all the
new functions I must find out the use of them by myself.
But I must go to work, get up aroun 4 AM every morning the last days and this
sucked very much too. I tested all the headers and now I had to include about
thousand of them in all the articles, humpf... a fucking dull job that breaks
down every nerv.
And, I found out the first errors (greetings to Mr Pink! =) ...
So if you want to read the mag without problems:
1st. Don't  try to  save an  article! You have to  reboot your  machine after
     saving, 'cause the whole machine is locked after this.
2nd. Don't try to change the music: at first  the music selector does not run
     in this version of the shell and if  you have stopped  the music and you
     want to load them again, the machine will be locked up too.
I hope the shell will be debugged next time  and some more features will come
up too (like  the selector  bar, the  music selector  and perhaps  some other
things...). There is already another feature included but we don't used it to
include pictures, because we don't had the motivation to search for some good
ones and at second up to  now they must use the current palette because there
are no rasters included and this isn't the best way.
Anyway I have to thank  EARX very much! Without  his works we  would have the
same old buggy shell and his work motivated us so much to go on, I can't find
the right words!
Ok, this for the strange things with the shell.
What happend the last weeks  and months? The Atari-scene came back to life in
a way I had never thought! Especially the swedish  highflyers DHS have worked
like hell and I think they broke  every release record within the last weeks.
Also some others  came back to life. Also  the next  parties will  bring some
cool stuff us. The VOLCANIC PARTY 4 was held last weekend but I don't got any
informations up to now. In the next months the biggest german party: the IJAM
and the ALTERNATE party will be held. A dutch only  party will take place too
this year and the date for the GIGAFUN'98 is also already set, and not enough
the QUAST PARTY'98 will come up to, and I think the PLACE TO BE will the next
smasher in summer. Perhaps with all these events new action can be blown into
the demo-scene, at least we hope  so, because it  gives us the possibility to
write something for your pleasure. As you know, we are not interested in fill
up the magazine with senseless stuff, it's a  scene-mag, for the scene, about
the scene and last but not least made by the scene-people! And the end of the
scene would be the end of the UCM! And we're not interested in stopping right
now, we want to see the year 2000!
Ok, I will not  talk to much  bullshit here, this fucking issue must leave my
home right now! I can't see all these disx anymore!

                               WE WILL STAND
                                  TILL THE END!
