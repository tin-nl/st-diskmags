Please answer the following questions...

[1] Do you own an Atari Falcon030?!
[2] Do you have at least 18 MB free space on your harddisk?!
[3] You're bored of all the fucking puzzle-games?!
[4] You like games like Doom?!
[5] You wanna suck some blood?!
[6] You wanna kick some asses?!
[7] You want to kill loads of monsters?!

...if you answered all the questions with YES you have to  read the following
lines very attentive!

"RUNNING" is the  first real 3D-shooter in Doom-style for the Falcon. Because
we know  that the  one-level-demo  has reached  also  the last place  on this
fucking earth we think that we must not talk much about the game itself.
Btw. Drizzt of .tnb.  had  written a review of the full game and you can read
it in this issue of the UCM.

The full game will cost, including  porto and  package, 59,- DM. Of  course a
detailed description is included.
You can pay CASH or REMITTANCE (you have to include the receipt with the bank
stamp!).

bank      : Sparkasse Kulmbach
bank code : 771 500 00
account   : 810 655

To get a copy of the game you can write via snail-mail to:

...Volker Konrad (RDT)
   Georg-Thiez-Straže 13
   95326 Kulmbach
   Germany


If you want to pay CASH ON DELIVERY you can order the game also via Email:

Ok, that's all I've to say. But let me  tell you, that a multi-player-version
is depending on the sales  of the game! The same for mission disk and so one!
So don't  take illegal  copies and  order your private ORIGINAL game! All who
crying about  the dying scene  and the shrinking output of new and cool stuff
should think about  it...
Just think  about the  work which was  included in this game. The makers have
worked about  three years on it and it's seldom  that someone invests so much
time in supporting a dead system!
I don't want to say that cracking has killed the Atari because it isn't true.
The most people (at least in the past) wanted to buy a machine where they can
get the  latest software fast and for free if possible. I think you know what
I mean.. But in the last time mainly freax were active in producing new stuff
for our machines  because  all the major-companies  have stopped the work for
our beloved machines because the sales shrinked down.
Not because of the crackers, no it's depending on the growup of the PC scene.
There they can make profit. The work on special conversions for Atari is only
wasted time  for them. Who needs 1.000 copies today if they can get 10.000...
100.000 copies of the same thing on another system?!
But now some crackers started  to crack  the scene-software  and this  is the
point I hate like hell! Just remember the game "Stardust"! I have my original
copy but it was the biggest shit so far to crack the game before the official
release! Perhaps this could be a reason that we  don't see anything  from the
guys behind the game, Aggression, today.
I also have heard that someone is  already hacking  around on  RUNNING  since
November last year and if this is true and  a hacked version will be spreaded
they're depending to the gravediggers of the Atari-scene.. No, it has nothing
to do with  supporting  the Atari. The one who cracks  scene-software, killes
the enthusiasm and the belief of the makers in their "friends". They  want to
do something for all the survivors and instead to be grateful some dull freax
cracking also this last stuff.
I'm sure that we can't do  anything against  this, but it's  a point to think
about our work and if its worth to depending to the same scene as those guys.
In other scenes started real wars because of  racking of scene-warez, but our
little and shrinked scene would not survive a war, so our only possibility is
to ask  them WHY?! they're  doing it... Perhaps  they can't  grasp  the whole
thing, but  so  we have  to help  them... we  can't  tolerate termites on our
wooden ship and I don't think that all of us have a kamikaze-mentality...
