                                 GOD:
                       IF I HAD HAD AN 8TH DAY
                I WOULD HAVE CREATED UNDERCOVER MYSELF.

...in April '97 the SiliConvention party was held in Bremen/Germany. A lot of
people went to  this place, even some guys from Sweden. When I walked through
the rooms at SiliCon, I also went to the one of NO CREW and DHS. The room was
loud, crowded and the air was a bit stuffy. I recognized a guy sitting in the
right part of the room behind his Falcon, toasting one toast after another (I
counted  TEN finally  eaten by him just within some 25 minutes...). The guys'
name was Evil of Dead Hackers Society. We began a little chat, esp. about the
further  demo-plans  of his  crew. He  told  me that  he - as graphician - is
nearly  the only  one left in  the band  and he  thought  he has  to finish a
"planned demo" by  himself. And  he showed  me  some  effects, too. I saw the
greatest  bumpmappers  so far  and  other fine effects. (Just  check  out the
SiliConvention-report in  the SILICONVENTION-Issue  of  UnderCover) Wow, what
great code, but will we ever see it as a demo?
Evil put me off till summer '97...

Summer came and  with it a big party in Poland, the ORNETA '97. A lot of guys
went there and even DHS  sent a 4k  intro to  the party-place. This thing was
called "4ever" and  had such  a mass  of effects that looked quite similar to
the ones Evil had shown me at SiliCon, I thought  DHS' big demo will never be
released, due to the fact all effects are already used in their 4k-intro...
Hmm.

Then autumn  came, leafes  became brown  and winter's  icy hand  reached over
Europe. Especially the North seemed to have awful weather because in only two
month  a  whole  bunch  of  productions   were  released  by  DHS  and  other
Skandinavian crews. A little ray of hope for the release of DHS' demo?!?

...eventually  it was  there! On 3rd of  January 1998, at a time  when nobody
expected it, "DREAM DIMENSION" by  DHS was released at IMP-Party 6. I leeched
it from their  homepage and took it home with me, not knowing what great demo
I've just downloaded...


"DREAM DIMENSION" is  1.2mb in  size, the  whole  demo  is  fitted  into  one
executable  file. After starting  it, the normal DHS-productions-start-screen
appears, with  an ansi  of the  crew at  the top  of the screen  and a lot of
screen-configuration-modes. This time they've really included a lot of screen
modes, it must be around 15 or so. The demo can be runned on RGB and VGA both
and even  some box-modes  are included. This  means  that  the whole  demo is
running in a little box in the middle of the screen. So you get the chance to
watch the  demo with  non-doublescan-fx, and  this is pretty cool! (Thanks to
evl that you've read my article in the last issue of UnderCover!) All  in all
you can use RGB 5oHz, 6o Hz, 5oHz BOX, 6oHz BOX, VGA 1ooHz, 9oHz, 8oHz, 7oHz,
6oHz and all these VGA-modes in the box.

After  selecting  your  favourite  screen-resoultion, the  screen switches to
black and  a mystical, grumbling music is played. Then a rendered violet DHS-
logo appearrs on the monitor. In its background a grey wall is placed, all in
high-res. The logo fades out and the effects-part begins.

Firstly, the  music turns  to a  fave  dance-music, with  is really  good and
suitable  to the  whole  demo. The  first  effect  are two  colourful tunnels
rotating anti-clockwise around  each other. The  textures are beautiful. This
effect is  shown - as  most other  fx in this demo, too - in cinemascope, but
with doublescan. As  next, a  fine bumpmapper  comes  to the screen. It looks
like a  rotating 3D-cube  watched from below. It has nice colors and is quite
fast. By  fading to  blue, another  tunnel is  displayed. It's  a  pentagonal
tunnel that  is moving  really fast all  over the screen. You can check out a
similar  one in SHADOWS' ACYL, but  this one  is much  faster  and has better
colors. Additional, there  are rays  of light  coming from the end of tunnel,
brightening the whole scenery.
Now a DHS-logo appears on the right side of the screen. It isn't a smash, but
okay for a  double-scan-logo. On  the left half a raster-effect with a lot of
colors makes  his bit. The  forms of the  rasters remind me of some julia- or
mandelbrots (or whatever those things are called;). Unfortunately this one is
shown a bit  too long. After  that, a colorful tunnel with the effect of Jeff
Minter's TEMPEST is shown. (I don't know its name) Looks nice.

Let's kick the MC68o3o in his ass! After a  high-res picture  by Lowlife with
two sport-shoes a  great, cool, fat  tunnel is  shown, pentagonal, fast, with
bumpmapping on  it and a really outstanding part in the demo's music. This is
maybe  the best  effect of  the whole demo. A  must seeing! This tunnel fades
over to a motion-blur that looks good. Hard to descibe it... The last effects
are two tunnels. First  one tunnel  is displayed, but  this time  the camera-
perspective is dynamic, so you sometimes watch forward, sometimes backward.
After some  seconds the same tunnel is shown as a bumpmapping tunnel with the
same great textures as the pentagonal tunnel descibed above. Wow!

Another fine  piece of  art by  Lowlife, showing  a little  cat with  a brush
sitting under a red "The End"-logo finishes  the demos. The music is timed to
all effects of the demo, so it ends by displaying the end-gfx.


DREAM DIMENSION is a smash. It not only has some marvellous tunnels in it, no
in this productions everything fits to the other. The music goes hand in hand
with the style  of the effects, and the gfx are a really fine selection. So I
nearly have no critizism about DREAM DIMENSION. It is part of the "big three"
of '97+'98, SONO and ACYL. Maybe the effects  are all in  all shown a bit too
long, but at least that's the way the demo is timed to the music. The readers
of this text and watchers of this demos may recognize that Evil, the coder of
this demo, was  a grafics-man once. I wish I could code like that. :) Respect
to DHS!
