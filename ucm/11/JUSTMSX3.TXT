Four years, after DHS released JUST MUSIX II, on 31st of november 1997 (to be
correct), the  third part of  this series of module-compils entered the world
of atARi. The whole  musicdisk has a  size of 2.8 MB, and  don't ask  me what
problems I  had to download  it from DHS' homepage  to 1.44 MB-disks. At this
point  I really  like to  thank  Grey/Mystic Bytes, who  splitted the too big
files to a suitable size.

After selecting on of the three resolution-modes at the beginning, the screen
is colored  in black  and a wild  techno-tune can  be heard. Then  some white
texts  are zoomed  in two steps to the screen, first "four years later", then
"dead hackers society", "presents" and finally "a toodeloo production". After
the screen  faded to black, a "Just Musix III"-logo is shown, held in violet,
and  faded out  quite  fast again. Now  the interface of the music-disk comes
straight our screen...

There are several nice looking gold or green looking frames, and within those
the several fx or texts  take place. In the frame  that is on the  top of the
screen, blue logos can be seen, saying "dead", "hackers", "society" and "just
musix III". Those  are faded  one after  another from time by time. The logos
look quite good, even  if I miss some antialias at some points. In a frame at
the bottom of the screen, a lot of  information are  given. The font  of this
frame looks  amazing. On the  right side of the interface another frame gives
informations  of what keys  to press  to get  information. There  are general
infos about the music-disk, something about the keys you can press, greetings
contact-addresses and craptalking. Eventually, on the left side of the screen
there is  the most important  frame with  the names of  the songs that can be
selected by pressing the numeric keys. The songs are:

1. Frequent modulation  3:o3        4. Summer feelings   1:48
2. Forbidden fruit      4:4o        5. Sweet simplicity  2:14
3. Xanthou garden       4:56        6. And maybe some hidden tunes...

All of those  songs are mostly  fast dance- or techno-tunes. In fact, I don't
like that style of music too much, so I won't say anything about it. ("what a
lame test of a music-disk, when the editor not  even says how the musics are"
that's what some British disk-mag people might say now ;) But please download
this  disk and  check it  out by  yourself! Only  that much: two tunes use 16
channels, one  tune has  12 channels, one  has 4 channels  and there is one 8
channel tune.

In the background  of all frames  a tunnel is displayed. It looks really cool
and can be  manipulated in  many ways by  using the keyboard. In the read me-
file, DHS wrote  about the serious  lack of cpu-time  while running  the demo
(some tunes  use nearly 90% of  the whole cpu-time). So they suggested to use
an accelerator, because of the old motto "the faster the better". Well, I did
so and  turned on my SKUNK. First  everything went right, but after maybe 1.5
minutes, the demo crashed with that typical "My DSP plays machine-gun sound".
I don't know what's so special about my accelerator, but obviously it doesn't
run with this music-disk.
Evil, I guess we should chat about this in IRc one day.


All in all  this module-disk  is very  nice. The design  of the shell is very
stylish and it might compete with Escape's MODULATION 3-interface.
Unfortunately the songs  are not my kind  of taste, but this doesn't mind too
much in the ratings.
