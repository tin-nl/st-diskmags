                                                                   .


I suppose  you  all know  that there won't  be any ATARI-EASTER-CONVENTION in
1998 like the great SILICONVENTION in 1997.

It's a pity..but there are some alternatives for Atarians.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. MEKKA-SYMPOSIUM 1998:   (Germany's probably largest party in '98)


   This party  will be organized by some AMIGA, PC and C64-crews (maybe Avena
   too) and is for all platforms (AMIGA, PC, ATARI, C64) BUT THERE WILL BE NO
   COMPETITIONS FOR THE ATARI :<
   No  doubt, the  party  will  be well-organized, but you have to decide for
   yourself, if you want to spend your time with PC & AMIGA freaks.
   Some ATARI-related organizers of MEKKA-SYMPOSIUM 1997 told, that the party
   was quite lame (drunken "freaks" puking arround and beating-up each other)
   and that the atmosphere was not comparable to the mood at the Silicon '97.

   If you want to go there though:

      when?
         begin  friday 10.4.98    12:00 am
         end    monday 13.4.98    12:00 am

      where?
         Heidmarkhalle
         An der Heidmarkhalle 1
         29683 Fallingbostel
         Germany

      contact?

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2. INTERJAM 1998 (Intercon + Animal Mine Convention + Yelling Yam)


   So INTER strikes back with their  3rd party. After  the  family-party-like
   Intercon  1996, which was a really nice  event for the ca. 40 Atarians and
   the  disappointing  InterJam 1997 (arround  10 Atarians  only!!) they  are
   organizing a replacement for the missing Easterparty in 1998.
   This party will be for PC, ATARI, C64 and ACORN-friends again.

   when?
      begin    saturday  30.5.98  12:00 am
      end      monday     1.6.98  12:00 am

   where?
      near Karlsruhe, Germany

   contact/more information?

      or any member of Inter, tSCc, Animal Mine...
      or just wait for the official invitationtext.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

3. ALTERNATIVE PARTY    (a great proposition)


   I actually do not know many facts about this party. I read that it will be
   organized by SETOK/AGGRESSION and  NOCREW either at easter or in summer 98
   and that it will take place in Sweden.
   The idea  is to invite  everybody with  old and strange computers, such as
   C64, Spectrum and  all this old  machines. Just  some PC's and AMIGA's are
   allowed (e.g.: PC's older than 386 only .. :), but all ATARI's!!!!
   There will be compos on all these systems (even on the very old ones).

   "GATHER  A WHOLE BUNCH OF  COMPUTER FREAKS TOGETHER. FILTER OUT ALL THE PC
    AND AGA AMIGA  PEOPLE. WHAT'S  LEFT? A BUNCH  OF TOTAL  WEIRDOS WHO THINK
    'LIFE' IS  A BUNCH  OF  PIXELS  MOVING  ACROSS  THE  SCREEN  OCCASIONALLY
    COLLIDING WITH EACH OTHER. THE NAME OF THIS EVENT? 'THE DIFFERENT PARTY'?
    'THE  WEIRDO  PARTY'? 'THE  PATHETIC  PARTY'? NOPE,  IT'S  JUST  A BORING
    'ALTERNATIVE PARTY'. MAYBE THE NAME ISN'T TERRIBLY ENLIGHTENING BUT WE'RE
    GEEKS, WE DON'T NEED GOOD NAMES."
                                       (taken from the Homepage of SETOK/AGG)

   We'll see...

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

4. LPT 2 ("THE FRIENDSHIP PARTY!!"   Wow..never seen such a concept before!)


   The  special thing about this party  is that  it is a  kind of  democratic
   organization. If  you visit the webpage of the LPT2 you will be confronted
   with a survey: "During 5 months, please answer those questions and we will
   make, with you, the best party in da world !!

   So you can influence, what the party will look like..
   e.g.: For how many people the building should be chosen?
         Internet-access or not?
         Which things are important for me (showers, sleeping room, arcade
         games, ... )
         ..and even the entrance fee!

   The organizers are rIBBON and I think also the Internetmag ORANGE JUICE is
   helping to organize.

   I don't know, how far the organizers will refer to the survey, but somehow
   I like the way, the party will be created.

   systems?
       ATARI, AMIGA, PC, C64 and AMSTRAD.

   when?
      begin    Saturday 11.04.98   10:00 am     (I THINK IT'S EASTER!!!)
      end      Monday   13.04.98

   where?      Clermont de l'Oise
               France

   more information?
         email :   drribbon@club-internet.fr
            or :   MSaderi427@aol.com
         or IRC:   #demofr
         or    :   http://www.citeweb.net/ribbon/

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

5. VOLCANIC PARTY 4  (already over?? ... yep, already over =( ...)


   Again a French party. This one will take place in winter 98 and is thought
   to be an ATARI, AMIGA and PC-party. The organizers are MENTASM.

   when?
      begin   Friday 27.02.98   10:00:00
      end     Monday 02.03.98   10:00:00  (i suppose am)

   where?
      Cournon (near Clermont-ferrand)
      France

   more information?
      http://www.pratique.fr/~dsoubre

   Several french Atari groups will  join this  party, as Supremacy, Typhoon,
   Sector One, Scarface, Popsy  Team, Trisomic  Developments  and many others
   and some releases are announced...

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Allright, that  was all, I could find out about  the ATARI-related parties in
the 1st half of 1998. As  you see there  are a lot  of parties  during a very
short time. (4-5 parties in ca 3 months!!)

Decide for yourselves..
(Maybe  somebody  (EVIL? :)  could  create  something  like  a  where  do  we
(ATARIANs) go-chart page..or so..I don't know..)

and do not forget the second half  of the  year..I suppose  there will be the
SATURNE-, ORNETA-, PLACE TO BE- ,IMPonance-, NAS and GIGAFUN-PARTY again.
