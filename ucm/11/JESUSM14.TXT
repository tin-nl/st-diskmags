pOSsEE: DTVM

=============================================================================

Hate... is  the only  feeling  that comes to  my mind  when  I think  of this
production. I  don't know if the  other 13 Demos are in the same style but if
that's the fact this crew should be vanished from the planet!

First of  all I  think DTVM is  again some  side-lame-demo-project  by a well
known swedish democrew! I won't bore  you longer so let us take a look on the
shitro!

Bootup. A lame  intro with 2 swedish  written scrollers and a flickerung MUCK
14 and some  DTVM logos. If  you want to  see the demo  you have to press the
'f'-key! Original, 'eh?

Part 1. Ugly  module-sound comes  up. Then the worst  graphics I've ever seen
appear on  the screen. 2 guys  talking in  swedish to  each other  go to some
green  meadows and  FUCK A PIG! A  fucking SODOMY-DEMO!!! After  the pig they
FUCK A COW! I've never  seen such a  perverted  vision  before! Are you up to
this in sweden?

Part 2. Now  comes what  really brings  hate to my  mind! Again module-sound.
Again pictures. Some stupid white man is standing face to face to a black man
and is torturing and killing him in several ways! A FUCKING RASCIST DEMO! AND
THIS ON ATARI! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! DESTROY FASCISM!

I FUCK YOU NOW  STUPID SWEDES! I DECLARE  WAR BETWEEN YOU AND ME COZ' THIS IS
'NOT' FUNNY! Some  screen called '3D_JUDE' does  not work  but the  name says
everything. When I get my hands on you I'll break your neck bastards!

RATING:   00%   in every category!
