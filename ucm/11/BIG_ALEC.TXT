1. About yourself
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What's your name?
- Gunnar Gaubatz, aka B.A./DeltaForce/The Union

- How old are you?
- Currently 24, but that's changing every year... ;-)

- What (or who) do you look like?
- Ordinary, boring, always fighting with my hair.

- What's your job?
- Still studying  electrical engineering in Munich, working for the students'
  board, working as a network admin in university, getting a life.

- Which kind(s) of music do you enjoy?
- Mostly  good  music, I  guess. Fave  is "progressive" rock/metal, but  also
  other  styles. I'll  better  list  some  bands:  Marillion, Dream  Theater,
  Genesis, Faith No More,  Queensryche,  Art of Noise,  M.Oldfield,  JMJarre,
  Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Kraftwerk, etc. Then I like that kind of 80's Pop,
  where synthies were actually distinguishable from other instruments :)

- What are you favorites movies?
- StarWars trilogy, Alien quadrology, Monty Python's classics, etc.

- When did you  come into contact with computers for the first time, and what
  was your first machine?
- Around 83, I guess, when I bought a couple of mags, that  explained all the
  basics  of  computers. From  then  on  I  was  hooked  and  spent  days  in
  homecomputer shops hacking my first Basic programs into Spectrums, CPCs and
  C64s. Around 87 we  got our  first  Computer at home, an Atari 1040STF with
  monochrome monitor, as my father used that system at work, too.

- Which computers and/or video games systems have you got at home?
- 2 Atari 1040 STF, of which one has 4MB, 1 PC K6-200 running Linux and W95

- If you have got computers, what are you doing with them now?
- One ST is  rusting away, while  the other one gets powered on sometimes due
  to nostalgia attacks :-)
  I mostly work with the PC nowadays, doing  all kinds of things, eg. reading
  mail, writing  papers, playing "xpat2", etc. Even  a little coding in C/C++
  sometimes, but nothing interesting (yet).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. About your Atari computers & activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When and how did you enter into the Atari demo scene?
- Around 88 there was this article by TEX on demos in a  german ST-mag, which
  made me  start coding  in  assembly. Then I met Flix and Ray, and we formed
  "Offbeat". Flix had some good contacts, which gave us a good start.

- When did you leave the scene and why?
- Actually we  never really "left" the  scene, we just became inactive around
  93, because  studies  became  more  important, and  nobody  really knew the
  direction  where Atari  would go. There was a lot of talk about the Falcon,
  but for me  personally it  was a bit too expensive for just a "fun" system.
  My father by  then already had a PC, which I used more and more frequently.
  Soon I  also discovered  that the PC  had an active demo scene, but I never
  got in touch with anybody there.

- In which crew(s) were you active? What did you do in these crews?
- My first tries at coding were done under the name of "Abacus Crew", I guess
  (I'm not sure!). After that came Offbeat, some time later we were swallowed
  by Delta Force :) - and  so  all  my "demo-dreams" fulfilled  and  I was  a
  member of the megamighty UNION!

- How do  you view  the decrease  of the Atari demo scene in the 90's? Do you
  think there will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?
- No, I don't  think it will be  revived to its former "glory". There will be
  some nostalgia  meetings like the "virtual ICC" held  on IRC, or  even some
  real meetings, but development will move on to bigger machines.

- Are you still active on ST? Why?
- No, I don't have the time.

- What is your best memory about the ST?
- That it's been faster than the Amiga... hehe!

- What did the ST bring you in your life?
- Well, some money earned from game soundtracks. :)

- Do you use ST emulators? If so, which one(s) and why?
- I tried  some, but I don't  really USE  them. Well, two actually: STonX and
  PaCifiST. Oh, but I  use another  program: ST-Sound  by Arnaud Carre. Great
  work here (Although it's not bugfree yet!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Your vision of informatic & computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What do you think about the situation of Atari computers nowadays?
- Is there a situation? =:^o

- And what do you think about PC computers?
- Ok, although not the best platform. But comparativeley cheap nonetheless.

- Have you heard about Atari clones? If so, what's your opinion about this?
- Too late. They  should have started, when  Atari was big, in order to be an
  alternative to Atari's shitty product policy.

- Will you buy a new computer within next years? Why?
- Not within  at least two  years I hope. I've just spent a lot of money with
  hardware - hey I'm a poor student, ok? ;^) However, if I had money to spend
  - I certainly wouldn't reject a little O2, or Alpha...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, let's play  a little game. I'm going  to give you some subjects, you have
to say what  do you think  about them. You can  answer  by giving a couple of
words or a short paragraph.

ATARI CORP.     - The greatest company that never was.

COMMODORE AMIGA - Why the hell, was it not upgraded to 16 bit sound?!?

CRACKING        - Has been, is, will always be there. People doing  that have
                  great skills. Why don't they code something useful?

DEMOS           - Hooking. Great stuff.

DEMO-SCENE      - Had a great time and a lot of fun.

FALCON 030      - The greatest computer that never was :)

INTERNET        - Yeah, it's nice  to be "online", but it can be frustrating,
                  when it's slow during prime-time.

LAMERS          - People  who trample  on  other  people's  nerves. Examples:
                  German chancellor  Kohl and his cabinet, Elton John and his
                  recent "hit single", and - of course - Mr William Gates.

JAGUAR          - A nice game console, which suffered from the aforementioned
                  product policy of Atari.

MICROSOFT       - Stealers, Lamers, EVIL EMPIRE.

PC              - Program   Counter?  Yeah,  relative  addressing.  Good  for
                  avoiding relocation.

THE UNION  8-)  - We want more money! Or else we go on strike! Oops, you mean
                  that  Union? Ok, well - of  course  the  coolest  group  in
                  history.

VIDEO CONSOLES  - I don't play  video games, because I'm too much of an idiot
                  at gambling.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
