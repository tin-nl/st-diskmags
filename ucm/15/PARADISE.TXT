           Oh no you are NOT dreaming !! ñDUNEð - famous French band mostly 
      known for its never released  òILLUSIONð demo - is back with a "new" 
      production ! Actually 2 days ago I received a letter from óMic/DUNEð 
      with a disk that  contained this demo and  a short text explaining 
      that this demo should have been out  almost * five years * ago and 
      that, moved by the efforts of ST sceners, some members of DUNE had 
      decided to come  back and face the challenge (as CREAM say ;-). It 
      DOESN'T mean we can expect _ILLUSION_ one day, especially since it 
      was mainly coded by Evil Metal who utterly left us many years back 
      without any second thought....

           Back to our  business : this is  a ñ150 Kb  dentroð that runs on 
      all Atari and even from a hard  disk. After  clicking the .prg and 
      waiting a while, a nice  chippy by  Kanewood starts  while two big 
      white blocks bounce against  each other, like a  huge pair of jaws 
      or a Pacman. The first picture (a DUNE logo) by Mic can be admired 
      right after. Then comes a white  door that  opens to  a "presents" 
      screen  with  two  transparent  triangles  moving around. The next 
      picture - óPARADISEð - looks awesome (!) and reminds me that Mic was 
      surely as talented as Niko back to the Golden Years !!

           The following effect is a  classic : a 3D starship  rotates in 
      the middle of a  starfield... The screen is  then filled with grey 
      scaled pictures of Marylin Monroe  which soons start  twisting and 
      distorting. In the foreground a big jelly cube appears and moooves 
      its body (come on baby  moooove it ;-). You  can note that all the 
      colors are very well chosen and that there is a transition between 
      all the screens ! The picture showing Santa Claus (hey, merry xmas 
      1994 by the way 8-) is average, esp since it seems to be scanned.

          A white box (often  used as a  transition) moves on the screen 
      and comes to place itself  on  the right  border : it changes to a 
      superb  DUNE  logo while a frantic spline dances with a reflection 
      effect at the bottom. After the  spline, there is  a box  labelled 
      stars that  contains - unsuprisingly  - a starfield, quite dense I 
      must admit. It looks a little  old  but still nice in spite of the 
      mainly black background. 

         Then another box pops up, this time on the left, replacing all 
      other elements and filled with a funny picture. A cool jelly ball, 
      mapped  with stars (I remember the Dragon Ball trend back then 8-) 
      bounces quietly on the right side.

         Time for the contact addresses (not  updated :) with a text on 
      the right and 2  * ócolorfulð * 3D cubes on the left. While they mix 
      they create new colors, looks nice. Next is a white  dot landscape 
      with another vertical text, a  scroller this time, with a greeting 
      list. The credits  are coming  now : a white box  rotates and then 
      goes to the  left changing to a very  nice  picture representing a 
      vampire, graouu Chuck  is a vampire ? Eh  eh, next the  gfxmen are 
      mummies and the  musician some kin to Frankenstein 8-) These small 
      pictures are really  cool !! A last picture  by Babar and it's the 
      end as a big white "END" rotates unceasingly on your screen.

  
         Bottom Line : one thing is damm' sure ; this dentro is a great 
         ------------- surprise for  all of  us who  considered òDUNEð as 
                       dead and buried ! Even if none of the effects is 
      really stunning, they're all fast and smooth as in  the old time ! 
      But above all the  presence of * óveryð *  nice looking pictures and 
      numerous  details  such as changing  the background  color and the 
      transitions make it a very pleasant demo to watch. There are still 
      a few screens  with a black  background but the  overall design is 
      very satisfactory. Last but not least let's hope we can enjoy more 
      gfx from  Mic someday ! he seems decided  to work on  ST again and 
      his address is given as the  official  DUNE headquarters so do not 
      hesitate to write to him at :
