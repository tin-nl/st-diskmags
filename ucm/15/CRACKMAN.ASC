          A few weeks (or was it  months ?) I  happened  to download the 
      demo version of a game called  òC R A C K M A Nð. I tried to play it 
      but thinking that it was another dumb and  boring clone of Pacman, 
      I just pushed it away and forgot about  it. Then the  full version 
      was released and I decided to  give it another chance. And I swear 
      I don't regret it. I know the game is having many troubles running 
      on Falcons but Teenage will hopefully  solve the  problem soon. In 
      the meantime it can prove useful to learn more about this game.

          This is a pacman  clone, undoubtly, but enough  new ideas have 
      been implemented to make it more interesting than any real clone ! 
      First Pacman has grown addicted to drugs but this is not important 
      in the  game itself, with is  just an ironic  excuse to provide us 
      with a óreal challengeð. 

          Run the intro and you'll get an informative text  about Pacman 
      getting a drug  addict... The  intro has  nothing  special  just a 
      simple font with a nice effect used  as a texture and a soundtrack 
      in the background. Press space and get yourself in the menu : it's 
      quite plain with only 3 choices as  follows : ñplayð,  òinfoð (or what 
      the heck am I supposed to do 8-) and óquitð. As most players do, you 
      choose to play and are invited to enter a password to start from a 
      saved position. Note that  most passwords are  quite tricky  since 
      they mix up letters and numbers (some of them are  really similar) 
      so do like me and have a  closer look at the  different screens to 
      make the difference  between 1 and I or 0 and O... It'll avoid you 
      long sessions of headaches...

          óTime to playð : following the principle of Pacman you will move 
      a small round yellow  character through  a mazelike  level. You'll 
      have to eat all  the pills of a level  to gain access to  the next 
      one. At first it looks  easy and  unoriginal. But there  are a few 
      differences brought  to the concept  here : first the ennemies are 
      ñveryð intelligent, in other  words if you go up they will go up and 
      so on. you'll  have to learn  how to cheat  them... Also  you will 
      soon find out that  you can walk  across some walls  but that your 
      ennemies òcannot follow youð (feeling stuck bastards ?). Then as you 
      reach level 3 or 4 (the whole  game features ó50 levelsð and another 
      set of  50 levels is  being under  construction) you'll be able to 
      pick up bullets or  mines. Time to  pay for your  crimes suckers ! 
      Also, if you remember about the  wall thing, you'll  discover lots 
      of ñhidden passagesð  either sorts  of shortcuts or bonus rooms with 
      bullets, mines or one-ups. Yeah it's getting cool !!

          Besides the game features other  bonuses that  are immediately 
      activated such as speed-ups, freezers (all  ennemies are stopped), 
      invicibility, Atomic bombs and  others. Very often  you'll  play a 
      few levels before you realize about  the hidden stuff and bonuses. 
      Then you'll  start it  all  again  with a new  eye 8-) If the very 
      first  levels are  quite easy  and  boring, they  only represent a 
      mental preparation to the rest of the game. Some levels will prove 
      ñreally sadisticð and you  may  spend a  lot of  time on them before 
      realizing  that  the  solution  was  right  under  your  nose (I'm 
      thinking of that level where you have to kill yourself and óALLð the 
      ennemies by picking up an Atomic Bomb 8-).

          Once you've grown used to the controls, either on the keyboard 
      or Powerpad, and have learnt all the tricks about the ennemies and 
      bonuses you will have  to face a real  challenge ! As for me I got 
      so  addicted to  the game that  I had to play  it again  and again 
      until I  finished it ! It had  become such an  obsession, I had to 
      defeat this stupid ghosts and others freaks !

          On  a  technical  point of view, Crackman  comes with a òsmooth ð
      òmultidirectional scrollingð. I  just wish the  rest  of  the screen 
      wasn't simply black, I hate black  backgrounds !! Also in the main 
      game you won't be enjoying  lots of sounds, just a  boring sampled 
      sound when you eat some pills. Luckily  when you swallow a special 
      pill such as a speed-up  you are offered a  óreally cool jungle modð 
      done by Tinker, waouuuuuuuhh it rocks !!!!!! Between each level or 
      worlds some other cool  mods can be heard and let me tell you that 
      Tinker is really a  great musician ! As for the gfx, they are ñneat ð
      and look  ok. They are  not  stunning  but look fine and  are very 
      pleasant. The main  effort  was  done  on  the  ennemies  who look 
      definitely ògreatð ! What  else ? Well you may still be surprised by 
      Crackman because you never know how to play a new level...

          óBottom lineð : Crackman is a real great surprise ! I thought it 
          ó-----------ð   would be another  Pacman clone  but it is really 
      ñmoreð than that. The  original bonuses and  special items, added to 
      the loud music by Tinker bring Crackman into a new level. Also the 
      difficulty will offer a óreaðl challenge to  hardcore gamers (yet it 
      is not too  hard either !). Not to  mention the  forthcoming level 
      editor that will be yours as soon as you  have sent back your high 
      scores to Phenomenon. I just hope this compatibility bug on falcon 
      will òsoonð be fixed. Anyway I suggest you try crackman because it's 
      another kind of game, not just a clone...

          Want to get in  touch  with  * óTeenageð * ? Then just feel free 
      to contact Phenomenon at ñfenomeen@atari.orgð 

          or visit them at òtnh.atari.orgð
