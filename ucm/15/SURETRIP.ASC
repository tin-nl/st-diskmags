           ~ Hey WHere Did YOu Get ThIS Cool FalcON EmuLAtor FOr YouR ST ? ~

          The first thing to remember about Suretrip is that until ñErrorð 
      ñIn Lineð started there was nothing  SURE  about the release of this 
      demo. Secondly, don't try to  unscrew the  plastic box of your St, 
      yes this is a ST demo, not a Falcon  one !!! Thirdly : in spite of 
      the high quality demos presented at Eil, *ò Suretripð * couldn't but 
      come first and I'll tell you why in a few seconds...

          Before I forget, and I know I will because this demo is sooooo 
      huge, please take note that  it features at  least 7 chippy musics 
      mostly due to  ó505ð (one was done  by ñTaoð) and even though most gfx 
      were painted by òmOdð, some were  done  by ñBlazeð, òMoondogð and me (St 
      survivor). What else ? oh yes, this is a 49% version  of the final 
      version of the demo and that makes my flesh go all  weird 8-) Last 
      but not least I'll try to give you a  description of the fx of the 
      demo because most of them  have never be seen before, so I'm sorry 
      if I forget to mention some gfx, detail or transition... Also note 
      that like Evil/DHS Defjam decided to use a 160x100 resolution.

          Ok time to start it : put the  disk into  your drive  and wait 
      for  the feast to  start : first there  is not much to see, just a 
      black and white tunnel moving forward with some usual text such as 
      "Checkpoint  presents  bla bla..." but then  the tunnel  is filled 
      with a yellow texture. Hum  nice. Then the window that contains it 
      starts to move from one side to the other, then up and down and it 
      starts distorting and more. Of course  the tunnel itself  is still 
      in motion in the  meantime ! Then the tunnel  grows to the full ST 
      window... Gradually "holes" appear  in  it  and you  manage to see 
      something through but  what is it ? When finally you realize  that 
      you are actually watching a 320 x 200 moving  background through a 
      moving mapped tunnel, you can't believe your eyes. 

          The following effect gathers 3 colorful  blobs which meet each 
      other, merge and keep  going. After a while they  also zoom in and 
      out !! And it's  smooth ! A  new  tune  is  launched while  we are 
      presented with a nice girl's face : we go closer as in a slideshow 
      but then we suddenly zoom out with an incredible blurring effect ! 
      In other  words  Defjam  brings  us  a 320 x 200  rotozoom with... 
      antialiasing on a simple STf !!!!! Ok take a deep breath before we 
      go on because you'll  need it, trust me (and if  needed  read that 
      line again 8-).

          We now seem to be stuck into a 3D box whose  walls are covered 
      with a violet texture. The camera flies up to the ceiling and then 
      moves around for a while before the texture changes. This textured 
      environment is incredible and words fail to describe it.

         But if you are  feeling bored  we can even  offer you a better 
     menu with let's say a fullscreen mapped tunnel with sampled sound. 
     If I were you I wouldn't laugh because Defjam did it !! Ok he uses 
     a trick, displaying every  two  lines (but  in 320x200 !!) but the 
     result remains amazing, it strikes you  like a  baseball bat right 
     in the nose !! The tunnel's palette will  even change and give you 
     an other viewpoint on this effect. 
 
          Let's move to some bumpmapping : hum I can  see the texture in 
      the background but where is the traditional crew logo ? Instead we 
      are given a huge (maybe more than 64 pixels high) scroller. Waouhh 
      is the only word I manage to speak and that is before the scroller 
      starts zomming in and out and then  rotating... no need to add any 
      comment 8-)

          There is also a kind of vortex that swallows texture as in the 
      òBreathð demo by Mystic Bytes except that here it keeps changing 8-)

          The following effect must be among the  oldest because I don't 
      really like it : it's a  green tunnel in  which a camera is moving 
      in all directions but  due to the  low resolution there  is a time 
      when your brain stops understanding what's going on the screen...

          Another fullscreen effect  is coming up : first there is a one 
      plan Checkpoint logo that reminds us of the intro to Modulation 2. 
      Then it  scrolls  from right to  left and  likewise... But soon it 
      expands and becomes fullscreen and it is also  covered with a pink 
      fire !!! Waouh a fire effect in fullscreen with a digidrum music !
      The logo is then replaced by a cube and later by a wireframe torus 
      no need to say how impressive it looks like on a damm old Stf 8-)

          Let's wrap as another  brainblasting effect  is on : this time 
      it is a 320 x 200 face  distorter ! I cannot describe  the various 
      manipulations applied to the  picture, you'll see  it yourself but 
      as usual Defjam makes us  go almost insane  with exctasy !! Pfouuu 
      I'm getting tired so let's move to the final part...

          Hum some vertical  rasters appear  like curtains pulled out by 
      invisible hands. A small window (can't say how big it is ? 64 x 64 
      or maybe more ?) zooms in and  various  effect are displayed on it 
      one after the other : a mapped  tunnel, a  rotozoom, a  bumpmapped 
      Atari logo, a face distorter... then the windows slowly moves from 
      right to left. Yeah nice  but... hey  wait ! Something  strange is 
      happening : the window is... rotating : god damm it, it's a cube ! 
      And it features one  of the mentioned effect on each side (no need 
      to add that they are in motion 8-). What da fuck ??? A mapped cube 
      with  moving  motives on them ??? Later  even the background  will 
      start moving, rotating and  so on... In  the  end  it  looks  like 
      someone has vomitted on  your  screen but the  effort is  here and 
      still you cannot believe it... One last  transition and  the first 
      part of the demo ends up with  "to be continued"  accompanied by a 
      nice picture by mOd... I need to take a break now 8-)

          ñBottom lineð : maybe  I should stop  smoking  weed  because I'm 
          ñ-----------ð   having sort of hallucinations when inserting some 
      disks into my ST drive... You had dreams, Defjam not only realized 
      them but he went further !!! My review is quite incomplete because 
      it doesn't take many  elements into account such as nice gfx, many 
      different tunes, neat and original  transitions and  much more but 
      by now you should have  understood that with  this demo a new step 
      has been done forward... A small  step for man, a  great  step for 
      the ST ! What  more can  I say ? This demo  could have  been named 
      "impossible is not Defjam" ! It is such a  shock to  see  so  many 
      wonders on a simple  1040 STf !!!! If you like  your ST, then feed 
      him with this  inescapable demo which  will soon be  remembered as 
      òone of the best achievements  on STð, believe me, believe it, it is 
      unreal, it is  magic  ñonlyð Defjam  could do it... and he did ! Get 
      the demo or you don't deserve having a ST anymore 8-)
