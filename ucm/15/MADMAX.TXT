                ÒINTERVIEW WITH: ÛMAD MAX of ÚTHE EXCEPTIONS

================================================================================

Believe it or not but we really managed it to get in cotanct with the master of
the chippy tunes on ST itself... JOCHEN HIPPEL also known as MAD MAX from TEX!
After years of research and we finally managed to get in touch with a pioneer 
of our time... Let's see what he has to tell...



UCM:       Hi Jochen, or should I say MAD MAX?!? Well anyway... We don't have 
           to say that much about you, coz everybody on Atari should have heard
           who you are. Please tell me, how old are you now and what did you
           during the last 6-7 years? I think Amberstar was the last music you
           have released... am I right?

MAD MAX:   Yeah, I think Amberstar was my last project but I'm not sure coz
           it's so long ago now. In the meantime I worked on smaller projects
           like a player for Jaguar but I never finished it.



UCM:       After you have visited the Siliconvention in 1997, everybody thought
           that you are back in the business coz you added the sidvoice to your
           editor and copied some new and previously unreleased chiptunes to
           Llama of tSCc... Unfortunately this was the only sign of life from
           you since then. Have you worked on new tunes or new techniques to
           create sound on ST?

MAD MAX:   When I first heard some SID-Tunes, I wanted to try out how all the
           old tunes from Wings of Death or Jambala would sound like with a
           SID-Voice. That's why I modified my player and added a Sid-voice
           as test to the tunes. 
           Then I wanted to know if I still can compose "new" tunes. The 2
           Sid-tunes where the only ones I had finished at the time of the
           Siliconvention. I spent very few time at my computer and tried
           crazy sounds. Sid-Voice 1 modulated from Voice 2 or 3, for example
           "Modu" Sound with Sid-Sound at the same time. The results are
           extremely distorted. They absolutely doesn't sound like YM 2149.



UCM:       Well, you mentioned in your first Audio-CD 'GIVE IT A TRY' that you
           want to create a full Audio-CD out of the Soundtrack from the game
           Dragonflight. What happened to that?

MAD MAX:   Unfortunatly I have to say that nothing has happened in that 
           direction. I have done some tunes on my synth at home but nothing 
           was finished.



UCM:       Have still contact to the former guys from THALION? I mean ES, -ME-
           and all the rest? Why haven't you worked for Blue Byte or Eclipse
           after THALION went down?
           
MAD MAX:   I have lately again contact to -ME-. I haven't seen him for about
           7 years. I also have contact to Daryl. A very few times with ES.
           The others seem to be lost.
           I have sent Bittner a mail but he didn't react yet. Well, I'm not 
           that long on the net. Concerning the 2nd part of the question:
           After Amberstar I have started my civilian service and was fed up
           with all the computer stuff. That was the reason why nobody has
           heard anything from me then and why I haven't worked for other firms.



UCM:       Have you earned many money from all the music you did for games on
           the ST? I mean you started with early stuff from RAINBOW ARTS and
           later on THALION. Was it worth it?

MAD MAX:   I am not rich. In the beginning it was very few money but in the end
           it was worth while. It was a fantastic time and that's what counts.



UCM:       Can you imagine how many ST Chipsounds or 'Computer Musics' at all
           you have done during the years? 1000? 2000?

MAD MAX:   I'm sure I've never reached such a high amount. I really can't 
           imagine how many tunes I have made but there are never 1000 or 2000
           tunes by me. In the beginning I mostly did convertions and I did
           over 100 of them. 



UCM:       As I am chipsound-freak I also collect C64-SIDsounds and I have 
           some tunes in my collection where your name is given as author!
           Some friend of mine told me that it could not be the same guy.
           So I ask you. Have you ever done C64 stuff?

MAD MAX:   I started to rip Hubbard-sounds on C64. Later on I have written some
           tunes with his player but there was nothing worth to spread. The only
           tunes that I have written on C64 where some of the Dragonflight tunes
           which I later on converted to the ST, but I never spreaded them.
           I would say the C64-tunes you have are not from me.
           Maybe there is someone with the same name.



UCM:       Daryl once told me that you have converted your 7-Voice-Amiga-
           tracker to Jaguar. Have you ever tried to do stuff for the JAG 
           and what do you think in general about it?

MAD MAX:   Yes, that's true. I have converted my 7-voice-routine converted to
           the Jaguar. It was fascinating how fast the routine was coz of 
           16 Bit, Stereo and Balance function for each voice, compared to
           the amiga. It was a hard job coz I have to modify my routine for
           16 bit, but it only played in 8 bit... Unfortunatly I haven't 
           seen much more from the Jaguar so I can't say anything else 
           to that topic.



UCM:       It was again Daryl I think who told me that you got hold of a
           Falcon. Is that true? If yes, what do you think of this machine
           and what experiences have you made with it?

MAD MAX:   Daryl lend me his Falcon but I nearly haven't used it. I also had
           no Software or Documentations at all. I have only a normal ST+.



UCM:       There are lotsa different sound-formats from you, esp. on Amiga.
           For example the COSO-Format. Well can you give us a little 
           overview of this format-jungle? Why is there no general replayer
           on ST or Falcon for all your Amiga-formats? Maybe you could
           release such a thing someday?!?

MAD MAX:   Ok, wait a minute, let me think. It all started with the TFMX-format
           on Atari and Amiga. Those tunes where umcompromised pieces of music,
           which existed mostly of ZERO's and they needed many memory place.
           That's why I wrote a converter that converts the TFMX-format to the
           COSO-format. I still edited the tunes in TFMX-format (even today
           they do so!). Then I changed Vibrato and Portamento-routs coz they
           should sound also at high tones equally strong. The Atari-player
           recognizes the difference in the header ("MMME" or "TFMX") and
           sets the right replay. On Amiga I was to lazy to do it like on the
           ST. With the time I added some special commands to the sound-
           administration, for example "SDIV" for Sidvoice. Unfortunatly the
           newer players on Amiga are not compatible to the older versions.



UCM:       You told me before that you are working with synths on new music
           that is more non-computer-based. What synths are you using and
           how will this 'new' music sound like?

MAD MAX:   I have a D 20 and U220. A friend of mine has some better synths but
           don't ask me about the types. The tunes still sounds too much like
           "Computer" but I'm still working on it.



UCM:       What do you thing about the evolution of chipmusic on Atari ST 
           during the last years? For example TAO's new invention called 
           'Sync-buzzing'?

MAD MAX:   I don't know Syncbuzzer-tunes, but the songs from the new demos
           are a lot better than some years ago. There are more musicians.
           The Sidvoice is a brilliant thing.



UCM:       Please tell us your fave games and demos on Falcon and/or ST.

MAD MAX:   Bubble-Bobble, Lethal-XS, Supersprint, Amberstar.
           The games are pretty old, but that coz I haven't watched the 
           evolution of the software on atari until 1997. I played the
           above mentioned games like hell. The TCB-Demos where always good
           but that doesn't mean that I didn't like all the other demos.



UCM:       What was, in your eyes, the most important/impressive frontiers
           the ST/Falcon coders stepped through the years?

MAD MAX:   In general I like it when you do things with your computer that
           are a total difference from the standard, for example SidVoice,
           open borders, Sync-Scroller and so on. All the stuff the Amiga-
           freaks said: "That's impossible!"



UCM:       The best memory you have from your life in the atari-scene?
           (best party, etc...)

MAD MAX:   STNICCC



UCM:       Have you any future plans concerning the atari scene? If yes,
           what can we expect from you then?

MAD MAX:   [Not Answered]



UCM:       VR-SECTION. DUNGEON MASTER. You are one of the 4 characters in 
           Dungeon Master... which one would you choose (Magician, Warrior...)
           and what guys from the Atari scene would you choose to complete
           your party?

MAD MAX:   I'm sorry but I never played Dungeon Master.
