          No this is not going to be a late review of an early Sepultura 
      album, rather an overview of what's left (erm) of the  ST scene in 
      France. Do not  hesitate to contact the ones  who have an  email !  
      Hopefully you can  refer to the  usual email and  homepages  lists 
      given in each issue of UCM. By the way I'm very shocked to see the
      number of inactive Frenchies who are greeted in demos !! I'm sorry 
      if it looks like some personnal business but BouB/Popsy Team, guys 
      of Typhoon (esp The Beast 8-(, St Ghost and  Hello/Sector  One are 
      NOT what I call active people !

          As usual Hylst, the only real  active member, is still working 
      on his huge 5 disks JAPMO. Why as usual ? Well he first planned to 
      release it more than TWO  years ago so - once again - don't be too 
      impatient...

          A new Atari band that seems quite promising ! Most members are 
      coming from alternative scenes ie CPC or Linux. They have  lots of 
      projects and they're also  working on their  homepage (French only 
      so far). Projects include a boulderdash clone coded by CyberFranck 
      with gfx by St Survivor. Future will tell...

          A few weeks ago I  received a  letter  from Mic/Dune  with the 
      never released  PARADISE demo. You all know the rest. Does it mean 
      that we  can seriously expect  more cool  demos from DUNE ? Well I 
      don't know but I'd like to see * ILLUSION * released some day (but 
      Evil Metal is selfishly keeping it to himself ! lamer !).

          After 5 long years of delay, uncertainty, rumours... Keops has 
      finally completed VIRTUAL ESCAPE, not it's not a dream ! Of course 
      this is a very old school demo, as Keops  apologizes 8-) but it is 
      very very good !!! Great design and pics by Nova, incredibely fast 
      code by Keops and Starlion, awesome musics by Jedi  and Mad Max... 
      Honestly this demo is 10 times  better than the Nostalgic'o demo ! 
      You  must * ABSOLUTELY * get it and  say a little hi and thanks to 
      Keops who has also recently opened an EQuinoX homepage from  which 
      you'll be able to download more stuff. I'm not sure of the address 
      so you'd better check it from DHS. A BIG THANX TO KEOPS !

          Sorry, no the legendary  French band is  not kicking  again... 
      But we are still waiting for the never released demo : Phototro. A 
      few times I contacted HMD  members who told me they would do their 
      best to release it but nothing happened ! Again more a rumour than 
      a fact. Too bad... No address or email...

{*f1IDEMLINE{*f0
    
          Maybe the oddest  French  crew since  most of the  time I hear 
      from Sine the  only member through  magazines like  UCM or Maggie. 
      Yes he's French but strangely he's more like a "ghost" than a real 
      guy. Maybe you can meet him at some party held in France. No other 
      contact possibility known 8-( The only  sure  thing  about Sine is 
      that he's always  preparing loads of stuff for our machines !

{*f1OXYGENE{*f0
    
          The Nostalgic demo was released by  early '99 and it sure made 
      us have gooseflesh when we  read the names of the  involved people 
      but... It sure looks old school but smells like dust too with very 
      old and unfinished screens, fake screen by  TCB and so on. No news 
      has been heard since then about the famous add-on of screens ! You 
      can try to email Leonard but don't really expect any answer 8-(

          Even though Hello and St Ghost  cannot  be said to  be active, 
      the band is still  working on several things. First Exyl the coder 
      is completing Pie Bill Gates, a convertion from this great PC game 
      in  which you throw pies  at Gates  face. People who  attended Eil 
      may have caught a glimpse of this neat and funny game ! Also he is
      working with Frost and St survivor on a cool St intro.

          It seems the brave knights  have been swallowed  by the Dragon 
      of lazyness and so their RESURRECTION demo is  nothing but another 
      wasted dream !! I guess Jace should  have been more careful before 
      claiming  he  would  bring the most stunning demo ever 8->< Again,

          Maybe my biggest disappointment comes from  this crew. We have 
      known The Beast as main editor and great collaborator to toxic mag 
      and also coder of the  series of St  Collections but  the army has 
      changed him into a lazy guy... It means that no more St collection 
      will ever be released. Telsud was  to bring a few  improvements to         
      ~ TRACE ~ but he  preferred to lame around at the lousy Volcanic 5        
      party. too bad...

          The only active member now is Ptif who coded the intro KINETON 
      released at the Volcanic 5 CP. Nothing stunning but  still a funny 
      demo and he's now  working on another one  but no release date has 
      been given yet. 

      see review -->> KINETON <<--
      
      Contact : the best way to get in touch with The Beast is       
               surely using his email : Beast_typhoon@hotmail.com
      

    I cannot ensure you that these addresses are still valid as 
the Beast enjoys moving to another mailbox every month or so 8-(

      some facts or not be informed about others. I just try to give you
      the clearest view of the Surviving St scene in France. Up to today 
      most French demomakers seem to have lost contact between them...
