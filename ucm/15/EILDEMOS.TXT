          Here are the St/F030 productions released at the òError In Line 99ð that 
didn't take part to  any compo or were presented to the Wild compo or 4Kb and so 
on. In other words these are  not ó* major *ð  productions  but sometimes pleasant 
surprises.

          òCodinggggð by ñCheckpointð (all Ataris)
      >------------------------------------------------------- -- -    -          
      
      I remember when I (STsurvivor) had this chat with Defjam/checkpoint about 
the famous Torus in the ñAMOKð demo being  just  an animation. He  answered quite    
naturally : "lend me  your ST for a minute and I'll show you that". And hell he  
DID ! As he found it quite  amusing he also decided  to spend an hour coding on   
my ST (and he  surely  will remember how  hard it is to use a  French  keyboard      
instead of German) to produce some fake screen. 

      So here comes óCodinggggð the ASCII convertion of the so called torus ! Well 
what is there to add ? It's quite funny even though you're not going to watch it 
everyday ! But give it a try at least once, you could be surprised !

          òF6 v2ð by ñCreamð (all Ataris)
      >------------------------------------------------------- -- -    - 
      
      When we went to this great party we expected a lot of stunning prods and 
no doubt we were not disappointed ! Unfortunately óCREAMð  couldn't finish their 
new demo on time (we saw the preview that almost cause several heart attacks ) 

Instead they  released a funny screen  right after the party. It is  only 160 Kb 
big and consists of a raytraced animation of a guy standing by a toilet bowl. He 
bends over it, goes down on  his knees  and pukes... Yeah cool, it reminds me of 
some party I went to sometime ago 8-)
     
      The screen comes with a short credit text and also an information that 
their forthcoming ST demo òHEFTIGð will be out soon. Nothing more to say.

          òA LOT OF STARSð by ñEscapeð (all Ataris)
      >-------------------------------------------------------- -- -    -
      
      This is the óonly 4Kbð screen presented at Eil and also the first attempt of 
ñSpion / Escapeð in ASM. Once loaded the  screen displays an  horizontal starfield    
that is very smooth I must  say. After a while  the stars  change directions and 
move forward  and  backward  again and  again. When you're  fed up you can press 
space to get a short  info page with  the credits and  some greetings. Well it's 
nothing really great but it's far from bad ! Let's hope Spion will  go on coding 
and bring us more effects !

          òBIGSCROLLERð by ñNo Crewð (all Ataris)
      >-------------------------------------------------------- -- -    -
      
      Here is the only ó128 bytes screenð that runs on all Ataris. It was coded by 
No Brain and comes in two versions : one in  color and  low res and the other in 
monochrome and hires (dunno if the latter works on a normal ST though).

      Click the .prg and  you see... a big  scroller. How  amazing... Well it's     
quite fast but there  seems to  be a  mirror effect  right in the middle of the 
screen and also a buggy line keeps staying on top of the screen. Of course when 
you try to reboot you get nasty bombs as a reward. If I were youI wouldn't even 
waste time to download this uninteresting piece of code. òForget it now...ð

         òSONGS OF DISTANT EARTHð by ñCreamð/ótSCcð (all Ataris)
      >-------------------------------------------------------- -- -    -
          
     We end up this outlook of the small releases of Eil with the best of them : 
a chip collection brought to us by ñMC Laserð for the musics and óTaoð for the code. 
It all starts with a superb tScc logo  by òeDoð  soon  followed by  the Cream logo 
that was already to be found in the intro to "Do Things...". Recycling rules 8-) 
The next screen is  actually the main  screen, it  features a background picture 
that must have been scanned  from dunno where (it looks quite weird to speak the 
truth) accompanied with the names of the ó 10  chipsð included. Last but not least 
the usual horizontal scroller can  be seen at the  bottom. Among the useful info 
you'll read that  MC Laser  has now left .tSCc., in other words the band  can be 
considered to be ñdeadð quite a sad news especially if you remember the quality of 
their legacy...

      Anyway  this  collection  of chips  sounds good  even though  theses tunes 
cannot be compared with  some TAO's  compositions (and you surely  guess why but 
now that TAO's editor is available maybe MCL will bring us new sounds !). All in 
one this is a nice compilation in which you'll find chips used in UCMs, or demos 
(like the Sweetie soundtrack). A compilation that óall chip loversð should get !

         óIBIZAð by ñPoets of Bombayð (Falcon only)
      >------------------------------------------------------------- -- - 
     
     Crap graphics, dodgy music, it's a fake demo. If you know the general            
culture that all us Brits take their in the summer hols then you may find some        
of this amusing. 

      Rating: 37%

          ñ128 SCREENSð by óReservoir Godsð (Falcon only)
      >------------------------------------------------------------ -- -

     I'm no gonna give any of these a rating because personally I don't like 128 
byte or 4K demos, because although they do show how good the coder is that is 
about it.

ñAmnesiað - Damn, what I'm I doing, I've forgotten.... Oh yeah, this demo runs
under 640x200/240 2 colours and scrolls "There is not enough memory in your 
computer for the application you just tried to run". This demo runs... said 
that already, right err... whats next?

òHotð - A lot of red stuff floats up the screen in 320x200/240 TC. 

óWormholeð - A moving twisting quadrilateral (thing with 4 sides :) ) that 
changes colour goes around the screen. Again 320x200/240 TC.

         ñREVERSE PONGð EIL preview by òParanoiað (all Ataris)
      >------------------------------------------------------------- -- -
      
     Once again òParanoidð strikes back with a new lunatic game ;-) This one was a 
24 hour release at Error In Line . Well not that  much to say : if you know PONG 
(and if you  don't  get dead  right now !) you will understand how  óReverse Pongð 
works. First the game  starts with a  sober presentation  of  two  rackets and a 
bouncing ball (looks like  a square as in the  old days ;-). Then you get to the 
main menu but all options are disabled so better skip that.

     The aim of this game is quite original ñ(maybe too  much ?)ð as you will have 
to control both the rackets and  play pong  against yourself. But the main point 
is that  you  only control one racket  at  a time and  only the one the  ball is 
òbouncing from !!ð got it ? That's why it's called Reverse Pong !!! You'll have to 
calculate the route of your ball to make  sure it  will hit  the other racket. I 
found the idea quite refreshing and  the game gfx are ok, though lacking colors. 
Also the chippy  music is  pleasant but... After a while you  get terribly óbored ð
playing all alone and missing the point... Then you quit and never play it again 
unless you get really addicted and I sincerely doubt that 8-(

     Personally I would have preferred a nice PONG  clone like the one  that can 
be found  in the  ñM-DEMO3ð by ó An Coolð. The music was  so raving ! I hope someday 
Paranoid will consider changing the  game's goal to something more fun otherwise 
I'm afraid this game will be quickly lost...
