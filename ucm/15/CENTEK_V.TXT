This day, the CLASS 4 (CENTEK) team was very disappointed to read these
following sentences in an official email from TITAN :

CLASS 4 can't accept this free stupid attack from TITAN !
So, here is our official answer

- It is not the first time that Titan send some bad and false
information
about the CENTurbo 2 accelerator board !
- Never have we fight Titan !
- Never have we send an official email with such bad things like those
from Titan !
- We have nothing (I should speak in the past !) againt Titan :
where is a WEB link on our WEB site !
NOT in the other SENSE !!! Hum....

But if Titan wants fight, we are ready and have many things to tell
about
Titan products like NEMESIS by exemple !!!

Is Titan afraid by the CENTurbo 2 to sell the mighty TEMPEST ?
CENTurbo 2 is running and produced : 192 units were already sold !
And what about the Tempest card ?

Hum, firstly it was said to us it is a COLDFIRE 5102 board..
Great, but it was said to you it will be 100 % compatible...
Hum, a stupid affirmation when you know (like us since may 1997 at a
Motorola Seminar) that the 5102 is a 68EC040 body !
(the other familly 52xx,53xx,54xx are NOT COMPATIBLE with the 68000
instruction set !!!!  5102 was produced by Motorola to permit a
transition of the Motorola customers from 68000 builded hardware to
COLDFIRE builded hardware ! The 5102 is surely 'has been' now... ).
For people who don't know what do the letters EC mean, I have GREAT
PLEASURE to explain you what Titan forgot to tell You :

EC means NO PMMU AND NO FPU (COPRO) !!!
The consequence of using a 5102 on an Atari system is direct :
- NO MAGIC
- NO MINT (or MULTI-TOS)
- NO LYNUX
- NO OUTSIDE and all other virtual memory systems !!!
- in general, no MEMORY PROTECTION very needed for inteligent and
serious MULTITASKING OS !!

- NO COPRO --> no POV by example !

- Sure, now are you happy to know that the 5102 at 33 MHz is performing
36 MIPS that is superior to the 68EC040 that is performing only 27 MIPS
at 33 MHz too ??
Hum..... me not !

I continue the incredible story of TEMPEST :
Recently (I don't know exactly when because we have surely to never
remind what was TEMPEST before...) you stoped to hear about the stupid
idea of COLDFIRE on the TEMPEST ...

It is replaced by a POWER PC !
Great, good idea to do like on Amiga market (you should adapt an Amiga
card on the Falcon, it may be quicket to design !).

The only problem is that you need a software emulator to run the 'atarti
software and OSs.
And the worst is that the bad and old TOS and software are in general
bad programmed ! So, it may be an urgent necessity to develop and modify
the general 68000 code emulator to adapt special dedicated routs for a
specific old software ! Hum, great and very big job, guys ! Good luck !

Seriously, the radical change of CPU on the TEMPEST proove only one
thing :
This product is only a nice amazing project and no market, no technical
studies was previuosly done !!!
By example, ask to Titan why they didn't kept the 5102 ??

My long experince designing the PHENIX computer during the last 2 years
is that it is very important to perfectly know the offer of the
electronical componeent market to do the best choices corresponding to
the price, the market and the needs of the customers you have to follow!
And at last you have to take time to test 100 % the prototyped product
before to produce and sell.

If you don't do that, you go to a financial catastroph !
Ask to some reseller in UK like SYSTEM SOLUTIONS what they think about
NEMESIS card !?
And it is not a CENTEK  speech, it is an expenrienced, respectable
and honnesty distributor's speech ...

Keep this in mind each day you are waiting for a product that nobody has
never yet seen ! (take that in your figure, Titan !).

And now, you have to know that there is no probem with the expansion
connector of the CT2 because there is no more !
The CT2A had a 32-Bit expansion connector that is a extended version of
the Falcon expansion connector.
The presence of this connector was firstly to allow us to plug our
internal parts of the PHENIX future computer to debug and realize the
software drivers !
In the same time, a complete pin out and hardware documentation was
available on our WEB site to allow hardware developers to do something !
Hey Titan, you never saw this documentation ????!!!

Unfortunately, only one serious project arrived at CENTEK :
A TEXAS 32C40x DSP card using the full 32 Bit DATA bus of the CT2 !
But the author never terminated (an atari market speciallity !) this
nice project...
It is sure people spent more time to speak (bla bla bla) than to work to
produce hard and software on Atari !!!

At Centek, 3 cards where designed :
- DSP56301 100 MHz  to avaluate the DSP of the PHENIX computer.
This card was presented at NEUSS october 98 and SILICIUM mars 99 in
France.
- PCI/USB card to avaluate the PCI bus and the USB keyboard for the
PHENIX.
  This card was presented with a S3 DX VIRGE at NEUSS April 99.
  It was running with 1600*1200 16-Bit graphical mode and DOLMEN OS !
- FAST-RAM EDO card to develop the new EDO controler of the CT2B.

Hey Titan, explain to all people how it is possible to see on the stand
of CENTEK 2 cards running on the CT2A if "we have a problem with the
expansion connector" like you stupidely told, or would you prefer
English Justice asks you (we will nextly install a mother company in
your country !) ???

Finally we have removed the expansion connector on the CT2B because :
- we didn't need more longer to avaluate the parts of the Phenix AND
- no other hardware development were planned at CENTEK or outside CENTEK
AND
- we found an other solution to connect the 16-Bit card of the falcon
(EXPOSE, ECLIPSE, etc...) on the CT2 B :
  the card must be installed between the motherboard and the CT2.
  There is only a MAL/MAL connector to solder on the card and plug the
CT2 on it.

We tried that with a German graphical card. It works fine !

And if you have a problem with a such fitting, CLASS 4 resolves your
problem FREELY !
MORE INFORMATION ON THE WEB SITE OF SYSTEM SOLUTIONS (link on our WEB
site).

***********************************************************************
So, to do a conclusion :

You CAN buy a CT2 and buy an ECLIPSE card !
The Eclipse card has an expansion connector : so, you have nothing to
solder !

You have not to wait an other accelerator board !
**********************************************************************
If Titan wants again fight Centek, no problem ! Ready to receive...
But I'm sure they are not so stupid people and fairplay do to good
buiseness without to have to speak in a such bad/pitty manner about
EXISTING products !


And I apologize me for my bad english...
