          Before starting to review this  demo I would like to point out 
      that as I was * personally * involved in the  graphic part of this 
      demo I will let you only judges of my pixels skills. Maybe Moondog 
      or MC Laser will  have enough time to  comment on my gfx otherwise 
      you'll have to do it yourself 8-) 

          The demo starts  with a cool sound quickly identified as a Tao 
      creation  soon succeeded by a  white screen  with the words "Let's 
      buggin" whose meaning I'm  still trying to catch. After a few secs 
      a nice Mystic Bytes logo drawn by me - St Survivor - pops up. Then 
      credits follow up. Note that unlike Evil with the Sweetie demo, MB 
      coders have opted for another  resolution "trick" and only display 
      every two lines. The first  effect is a fast  blue tunnel. Credits 
      are displayed with a 1 plan white font  placed either on top or at 
      the bottom  of the  tunnel window. Looks well designed ! Next logo 
      is naturally the name of the demo : * ñBREATHð * . I wanted it to be 
      colorful and a synonym of happiness, so I hope  you will find I've 
      succeeded 8-) 

          The  following  effect is  now the wellknown mapped tunnel. It 
      comes with a nice texture and it is  not a classical  tunnel as it 
      seems to be seen  from  inside. Actually do you  remember the  way 
      dot tunnels used to be done on ST ? It's the same but with texture 
      instead 8-). Again a very  nice effect. Time  to stop by a strange 
      tree. I remember  when I  first  planned to  paint it : I had been 
      reading a special TIME issue on environment issues when I happened 
      to be watching  a cut rainforest  tree... in the shape of an ATARI 
      logo... You guess what I came up with then 8-)

          Next part is - already - dedicated to loads of greetings again 
      in a 1 plan font along  with a great texture  distortion. Erm hard 
      to describe, you'll have to see it yourself. Just remember that it 
      looks damm beautiful even  though some  people greeted there don't 
      deserve it (have a  look at my  article about  the French scene to 
      find out). The green vortex  is one of  my favourite : well it's a 
      flickering  moving  vortex, a  sort  of  hole  in the  ground that 
      swallows everything around (actually it rather seems to exhale it) 
      in 320x200 ! I love it 8-) More  texture  distortion for  the last 
      part of the greetings...

          A Japanese woman appears on the right side of the screen while 
      some text  fades in on  the screen. The sentences are  very poetic 
      like "I'm hanging on your  breath...". Right after we're presented 
      with a sort of rotozoom on a green texture, as usual fast and good 
      looking. A small  touch  of  humour  with a weird coyotee that may 
      remind you of the "roadrunner" cartoon even though it wasn't meant 
      to. Another texture distortion, again  undescribable and different 
      from its predecessor. You just have to know that it's great 8-)

          Another paragraph for  one of the * ómost originalð * effects of 
      this  demo : a water effect. Just imagine  watching a pool and see 
      small waves twisting on the surface. One word is enough. Awesome !

          One more picture by the lamer St Survivor, actually  the one I 
      prefer maybe and of course most people tend to dislike it 8-) Time 
      for the traditional bumpmapping screen with  MSB letters. Nice but 
      I personally prefer * ñDHSð * try. One last  picture  representing a 
      succuba (the picture I presented at the 16 color gfx compo of Eil) 
      and it's time for  the final  screen : again a nice  mapped tunnel 
      with a  camera moving  from left to  right with a plain THE END in 
      the now usual 1 plan  white  font on  the lower  right  corner and 
      after a while, you can reboot.

          Bottom line : like Evil * Mystic Bytes * has just walked their 
          ------ first steps on ST and we can only rejoice ! The demo is 
      damm good with unseen and  fast mapped effects, cool music by Tao, 
      lame gfx by me (8-) and sincerely I just think it's as good as DHS 
      demo, in other words you òMUSTð have it.
