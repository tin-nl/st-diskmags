          When they read the  title of this review  most  ST freaks must 
      feel they heart beat much much faster at once... Yet this is not a 
      dream or then it's ñthe most  beautiful dream everğ... One of the so 
      long awaited legendary demos is out, 6 years later !!

          Unpack the msa archive to a blank disk (ooh gosh why does this 
      stupid heart keep beating that strong in my head ?!) and reboot... 
      first there  is nothing  but  a small "crack  to beat this : third 
      part" then a nice vertical  òEQUINOXğ  logo appears. Everything goes 
      óvery fast rightğ after : a speedy chip is heard while a text in a 1 
      plan font  zooms  in, word  after  word, rotates, zooms out... the 
      framerate is so fast and  smooth ! A really  great  Virtual Escape 
      picture is displayed while tons of 3D objects succeed each other : 
      pyramids, spheres, spaceships and others... This is the end of the 
      presentation and you already feel the sweat run down your cheeks.

          Fortunately the rythm goes - a  little 8-) - slower (but still 
      as smooth as ever !!) in the  main part : from a small EQX writing 
      some dots  fly away  and  grow to big  white letters until you can 
      read the words : Full Steam Ahead. Then you notice  that the music 
      is another ócool chipğ  by Jedi. The first  effect here is two balls 
      filled with green and yellow rasters. They move around and mix and 
      then sorts of  worms replace  them, moving  again at an incredible 
      speed. Next are maybe 6 transparent balls that spin around. A cool 
      though classical  jelly ball with stars on it pumps on the screen, 
      followed by a pleasant picture.

          A dot  ball comes  zooming in, moves  around and  then changes 
      shape to a torus and other  objects. It's quite  big and  still so 
      smooth ! Next effect is something I have already seen... but in an 
      Amiga demo : it's  a  city  whose  buildings  are seen  from their 
      figures. Hard to describe but you have to see it because it's ñveryğ 
      ñoriginal !ğ A rotating text, stylishly  displayed, proudly anounces 
      a forthcoming glenz vector withò 192ğ faces and here it goes flanked 
      by two horizontal  ornemental bars. The text is  on again and this 
      time announces  11 independent  dot balls : here they are bouncing 
      against  the limits of the  ST window. Nothing  to add : it's neat 
      and very smooth !!!

          A set  of  moving  gear  wheels  serves as  background for the 
      credits. The names of the  differents persons involved come in and 
      bounce on a jelly cube. Nice idea ! More  to come like : dozens of 
      rotating  dot  balls  forming  complex shapes. As  complex as what 
      Zappy had done in his * JAPTRO *  demo but òeven smoother !ğ Various 
      stylish fonts are then used to give the name of all the members of 
      Equinox : again, in spite of the age of the demo the style is very 
      good !!!

          Next is  a cube  made of dots : it  moves  around, rotates and 
      even gets distorted  without any  slowdown as usual. A  pretty EQX 
      logo  is displayed on the right  side of the  screen while a paved 
      sphere keeps  rotating on  the left  with an astonishing  blurring 
      effect. The logo  slides to the  left while a window  opens on the 
      right to let a fireframe animated  bird fly its  way. It cannot be 
      said to be impressive but the  movements of the bird are òamazingly ğ
      òrealistic !ğ

          More text is on the way accompanied by a  huge paved ball with 
      a blurring effect. We can read  some info about the demo... A last 
      superb Equinox logo and we have reached the end... part 8-)

          The End part features a cool chip  by Mad Max  and a 320 x 200 
      starfield with a vertical interlaced blue font. Very well designed 
      and the only part of the demo that has been modified since 1992 !

         òBottom Lineğ : more  than the  Nostalgic'O demo,  Virtual Escape 
         ò-----------ğ  will make all St lovers shed a little tear because 
        it is pure old  school and at the same  time it is * ñincredibelyğ * 
        optimised : the musics, 3 in  all, sound really  great, the gfx by 
        Nova are  awesome  and the fx coded by Keops and Starlion run in 1 
        VBL. Everything is smooth oh yeah and *ó very veryğ * fast sometimes 
        even your eyes will strive to keep up with the pace of the demo. A 
        real master piece coming from another time.

          Last but not least as the tradition wants, the demo includes a 
      hidden screen that can be found if  pressing the adequate key when 
      the intro is loaded... You  just have to  consider the name of the 
      demo to know what key is the good  one. Also if you want to drop a 
      line to Equinox then you can reach them at : ñequinox@planet-d.net.ğ

          Also you can visit them at óhttp://equinox.planet-d.netğ

          I'm not sure these are the correct  addresses since I tried to 
      write  them down during the endpart  and that damm  scroller was a 
      little too fast.... Refer to  DHS news section if you cannot reach 
      them there and GET THIS STUNNING AMAZING AWESOME MASTERPIECE NOW !
