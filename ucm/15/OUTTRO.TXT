                            ò MOONDOG'S OUTROð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hmm... well... anybody knows  about this  fact and so I think  there aren't more
words to loose... or what?

Some months back I was angry  about everyone who was leaving the scene, and now,
I'm standing  on the same point. I wanted to lead the UCM to the next millenium,
but I failed...
The reality  has catched me up in  a very special way and some people know about
my reasons to end this part of life, my part as "moondog - poets of decay".
Errrr, false, I will  use this nick also after my UCM time, I will not leave the
scene at all, I'm just going to be an "inactive member", because my real life is
much more important at the moment and maybe forever.

And so it's up to me to find some words for this outro. With the UCM I will lose
a part of my life... back in 1993 I was one of the founders of this magazine and
now I'm the last one of the old staff and it's time to  hand it over to the next
generation, who is able to save the UCM for the future.

I will never forget the times, as I wrote  articles, swapped via snailmail a lot
of disx to get the latest  stuff for reviews, phoned  with the coders because of
some problems and so on. UCM was over years a part of my life and I will miss it
for sure. I was too much involved in this magazine, some people even said "I was
the UCM" as I can leave it without any thoughts about it's future.

But with the new formed staff it should have a future and with MC Laser at least
one of the "second generation staff" is  left on the  boat, which is filled by a
few enthousiasts who will go on with the mag, to give this scene some color.

My  thanx to  Stefan, Sebastien, Pieter, Peter, Michal  and  all the  others who
decided  to take  the future  of the UCM in their own hands  now because  you're
saving a part  of my life and a part of this scene as well. Furthermore you make
it easy to me to take a look  at my private life without feeling guilty  to have
stopped my work for the UCM.

Ok. I think  it's enough  of this. I will be here or there for sure, maybe we'll
met  on another  Atari party  or at least on the IRC sometimes and  maybe I will
write the one  or other destructive article for forthcoming  issues of  the UCM,
who knows? =)

Ok, go on reading UCM 15, the mega-delayed issue...

                                          yours, Eric aka moondog/poets of decay
