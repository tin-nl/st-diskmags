I. Let's Create Your Own Editorial. Hopelessness: Chapter One.

            4.30 p.m. The tube train draws to a halt. There is
            no  station in sight. Anxious  glances dart around
            amongst  the   passengers  as   they   acknowledge
            each other's presence for the first time.
             At the end of  the train, a young lady in a green
            trouser-suit  stands  up  in  the  centre  of  the
            carriage   and  proceeds  to  unbotton her jacket,
            which  she  removes and drops to  the dirty wooden
            floor. She also takes off her shoes, her trousers,
            her  blouse, her  brassiere, her  tights  and  her
            floral panties, dropping them  all in a neat pile.
            This leaves her  totally naked. She then moves her
            hands across  her thights  and  begins  to  fiddle
            around  in  between   her  legs.  Eventually,  she
            catches  hold of  something cold and metallic, and
            very slow she starts to unzip her body; working in
            a  straight  line  up  the  stomach,  between  the
            breasts, up the neck, taking it  right  on through
            the  centre  of  her  face  to  her  forehead. Her
            fingers  probe  up  and  down the  resulting slit;
            finally  coming  to  rest on  either  side  of her
            navel.   She   pauses   for   a   moment,   before
            meticulously working her flesh apart. Slipping her
            right  hand  into the  open  gash, she  pushes  up
            through her  throat, latching  on to  some  buried
            solid at  the top of  her  spine.  With tremendous
            effort,  she   loosens   and  pulls  out  a  thin,
            shimmering, golden rod. Her  fingers release their
            grip  and   her  crumpled  body,  neatly   sliced,
            slithers down the liquid surface of the rod to the
            floor.
                                  SPLAT!
                                  
             The  rod  remains hovering just off the ground. A
            flagpole without a flag.
             The  other  passengers  have  been totally silent
            but, at the  sound of the  body  dropping  on  the
            floor, a  large  middle-aged  lady, wearing a pink
            dress and  matching  poodle, stands up and shouts,
            "STOP THIS, IT'S DISGUSTING!"
             The golden rod disappeared,
             the  green  trouser-suit  was  left on a  hanger,
             with a dry-cleaning ticked pinned to the left arm.
            On the ticket was written:
            NAME.........................
            ADDRESS......................
            .............................

II. Let's Create Your Own Tetris-Clone. The Practical Bit.

Some month ago, I had the feeling  that  everyone in the scene has to  have his
own  Tetris-clone  and I felt  quite uncomfortable  when I saw  that neither my
former  group .tSCc. nor I had done  something like that. So  you might imagine
that I firstly asked the coders of .tSCc. to code one...  

But I should  have known  better. DYNACORE told me that it's more important for
him to  code a multi-xxx-picture viewer  for PC, featuring an undresser-option,
which is  able to undress dressed chicks on his pictures, LLAMA was honoured by
his  name as  lamer, doing  "nothing"  on PC and SCY  was a  bit confused about
the fact that Ataris  still exist. So it  was on me to do it myself and in this
part of the aRt fACtORy you'll read about the results of my tries.

I loaded  CrackArt (still  my favourite  gfx package!) and searched through its
zillions  of  options  and functions. But  Hell!  There  wasn't a  "Create Me A
Tetris-Clone"-function.  Does  CrackArt  suck  because  of  this?  Surely  not.
Because  when you're  quite clever in painting, you can even paint your Tetris-
clone by yourself.

Btw, a  big Hi! to  my artist-mate  a-t-. I guess  you think  that I am totally
mad, painting  Tetris-clones with CrackArt in pixel-style and you would like to
give  me  a  hint, concerning  the "Do  me  a Tetris-clone"-function  in  sucky
PhotoShop-package  on PC,  converting  it down  to  Atari  afterwards  and tell
people it's pixeled...

/grins

Well, so I sat down, chose a palette and entered the zoom. 

Two  seconds later  I realized  that it  will be  much harder than I originally
thought  it  would be. Big  problems  appeared, such as "How to make the little
Tetris-pieces move" or "How  to bring it to the people"? A Tetris-clone in PC1-
files wasn't there  before, but it  might  be quite  lousy as  well, don't you 
agree with me?

So I skipped the whole Tetris-project and called the tries I'd made...

"New technique in dithering."


Okay,  but now  we're  stopping  this chatting  around and going in medias res.
In the latest  aRt fACtORy  I taught you my "normal" dither-style which is good
for faces  and little  areas, but  also quite  boring or monotone in background
dithering works.  Maybe you remember, this dithering-technique looked like this
in its final state:

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 3 138 166}

It looks  a bit  like  Floyd-Steinberg  algorithm  and is maybe the best for 16
colors, because you blur the  area between two colors in a really good  way. In
more 64 colors this  one looks outstanding. But, as  I already  wrote above, it
looks  boring if  you dither a whole  picture with one style. This is also true
for the new dithering-technique I'm going to explain. Never use  it as the only
dithering style for a picture. Eventually I will go to explain you why.

But  before I  start to teach you  the single steps, we're gonna check out what
tools we need for this tutorial...

- A good painting  software, CrackArt is  highly recommended but  you can  also
  use 030er gfx-packages.
- A palette with a  bright and a  dark color. Make  it quite  contrastful, it's
  easier to paint that way. In the end, you can always turn the colors back.
- A zoom-option, set to middle magnitude. 
- The  most important  thing:  A pocketful of  patience. To  be  honest, you'll
  fall  into  deep  desperation when  you're gonna  dither a whole picture with
  it. But don't mind, you'll learn. At least even I did so.

Finally, we  need  some basic forms  for dithering. The new explained method is
not only a  wild "pixel"-orgy, but  built up  with different  pieces of pixels.
This might be  confusing, so  here's a little (ugly) sketch for you to see what
I mean with "pieces". (Don't wet your pants now.)

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 20 0 68}

Ahhhmm, well, the  "pieces" look quite tiny I guess, esp. on RGB-monitors. So I
think we should  pump 'em up to get  a better view  on them.  C'mon gimme  some
pressure....

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 20 67 137}

Wow, that's  quite  confusing, isn't it? But  don't  mind, in  the beginning we
will only need piece 1 to 6. If you are experienced, you  can implement piece 7
to 12 optionally.

So, the first  thing we need now is a bigger area in a picture where two colors
are laying right beside each other. This may look like this:

{*i artfact.pi1 m 3 6 138 166} 

When  I  am going to explain the steps now, I'll always use  this picture  from
above  as  the  original  picture. So  you  can see  my dithering  as a organic
process.


FIRST STEP

{*i artfact.pi1 m 6 9 138 166}

Paint  little  L's (pieces 3 to 6)  every now  and then  into this area. Please
always paint  as  much L's  on the  one side  as you've done on the other side.
Don't paint these pieces  only on one side. This would look crap, cause we will
dither the area to the bright _and_ the dark side, both.


SECOND STEP

{*i artfact.pi1 m 9 12 138 166}

Now  put some  of those  blocky pixeled  numered  as piece  number 1  into  the
picture. Paint  them  at  your free  will, but  always  check  in  the unzoomed
version if it looks okay.


THIRD STEP

{*i artfact.pi1 m 12 15 138 166}

Paint  some  single  pixels (piece number 2) close  to the pieces you've set in
the second step.


FOURTH STEP 

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 3 167 196}

Now  paint little  L's  again (pieces 3-6), just  as in  the second  step.  But
this time paint them a bit wider away from the others. 


FIFTH STEP 

{*i artfact.pi1 m 3 6 167 196}

Put some single pixels (piece number 2) CLOSE to the L's pf the fourth step. 


SIXTH STEP

{*i artfact.pi1 m 6 9 167 196}

Same as in  fifth step, but this  time you've gotta paint those pixels far away
from the pixels set  before. Please  note that the farer you  get away from the
area the two colors crush together, the less pixels you should set.


SEVENTH STEP 

{*i artfact.pi1 m 9 12 167 196}

Do some  optimizing, which  means improving  areas that look crap by correcting
the  set of  pixels. This really  cannot be explained in an  abstract way. Just
look at your dithering and ask yourself if it's clean or not.


EIGHTH STEP

{*i artfact.pi1 m 12 15 167 196}

So  your dithering  work is  ready? You  are  satisfied  with it? Then  put the
colors back  to their original  state. You will see that the less colors differ
from  each  other, the  better  the  result will look  like. Just check out the
little pic above...


Okay, this is the way "how" to dither in that style. But this  isn't the end of
my  explanations, cause  I think it's  also important to  tell  you  about  the
"when" of  its  usage. But before, please  let  me tell  you  that I personally
don't really use  algorithms like the explained above to paint my graphics. The
steps I described were only a  rough, abstract  way to  show you, the  readers,
how it works.  Personally, I  paint freestyle and don't think too much about my
way of getting to a result. It just happens.

So when you should use this method of dithering? This question is not too  easy
to answer, due  it may  depend on  what you're painting. With one colour-set it
could look  splendid whilst with the other it looks crap. But as rules of thumb
you may keep the following in mind:

"USE IT FOR LARGE SURFACES, ESP. FOR BACKGROUNDS."
This is the  best usage  of this dithering  method. It looks  cool in 16 and 32
colors  both. Don't  mind if the surfaces  you got to dither  are huge - you've
got nearly  all  time in  the world. (e.g. for dithering a 200x100 pixel square
box with  2 colors inside (with  strange lines etc.) I need  about half an hour
or so; don't despare if you're not that fast!)

"DON'T USE IT FOR HUGE FACES IN 16 COLORS."
That's what I  can tell  you cause I  made  the  test. I painted  a  fullscreen
women's  face in  320x240x16 (yes, 240 lines in y-range!), taking - as always -
7  colors  for the  face. The  dithering looked  quite crappy  there cause  the
several  color-surfaces  of the skin are pretty big and it is hard to modellize
with this  dithering-technique as  with the  other one I  explained  last time.
Btw, if you're interested in seeing the  picture I  mentioned above, just  wait
for CheckPoint's SURE TRIP demo  or take a look for a picture called "KISS ME!"
at my internet gallery, brought by you via the homepage of .tSCc. at

                  www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uno4/modart.htm


"JUST USE IT BY FREE WILL IN PICTURES WITH MORE THAN 32 COLORS."
Due to the fact that the colors in a bigger palette are  not differing too much
from  each other, you don't  see the blocky style  of the technique anymore and
you can modellize the surface by using colors, not dithering.


Well, that's  nearly all I can  teach you  about this technique. If  you've any
questions  about it, please  write me  emails (my address can be found right at
the end of this article), gimme a phonering or just ask me at EIL party.

Maybe one final sentence you always should keep in mind: "My tutorials can only
teach you technique  and stuff, but painting  means so much more then technique
and cannot be learned from one day to another."

Good luck!



III. Let's Paint Some More. Monochrome Antialiasing Explained! The Hidden Part.



















IV. Let's Play Buttkicker. The critical part.

Serious meant criticism is a way to improve skills, so let start the show 
with...

-CREAM: "do things."
The long  awaited successor-demo  of "STMYGH 2" also  featured  the latest (and
hopefully _not_ the  LAST) 16  color graphics by  a-t- since about four or five
years. There was a lot of  hype around this  production before it was released,
about its  technical brightness, outrageous graphic stuff and kewlish style. So
let's check if the rumours spread were true or false...

Because  THIS is the aRt fACtORy, we  are only going  to check  out the design-
and  graphical  bit. For  a full review, please  read the test  in this issue's
demo corner.

Firstly, we're  going to  check out  the positive  bit, which  prevails  in  an
extraordinary  manner. The  whole demo is held in one design style, which maybe
reminds  you of some  works a-t- did  for Poland's  MYSTIC BYTES. The design is
good, maybe  its coldness  bites a bit to the  warm colors of the graphics that
were used around it.

Btw, the colors.

Wow! I had  to say, expressing  a deep feeling of respect. The colors in a-t-'s
pictures are  quite wisely chosen and  he uses  them in an impressing  easyness
that  cannot be copied  too fast. Unfortunately I had to hear that the palettes
look crap on ST with its 512 colors, but I haven't seen  it myself, so I cannot
judge.

Furthermore  the scans in the slideshow-part are of extraordinary quality and I
wonder a bit about a.) which scanner  a-t- uses to get  such results or b.) how
much time  he  has  to  work  on  his  scans  after  he  scanned  them.  Really
outstanding quality, no doubts.

The  logo  in the  beginning  is  typically a-t- style,  looking  like a sip of
water.  Again, the colors  are great on STE. I really like the background stuff
in  the logo  which looks  a bit like using spraycan  with a  4x4  pixel brush.
Nevertheless,  the  logo  looks  like  the  logos  in  DEMENTIA  by  AVENA  and
IMMORTALIZE  by WILDFIRE,  maybe a bit  different in their colors, but the main
style is the same (=creativity?).

Finally, the  unethical  part of  using  down-calculated  PhotoShop/render-worx
from PC in  the first  picture of the  slideshow may suck (also in my opinion),
but the motive of  the cities' skyline is very  good  in  colors and  technique
both. Without  the head and the  white part  on the right side in general, this
would have been a real smasher. 

Okay, now the negative bits.

I struggled  a long time with me if I should also write about things I realized
which aren't too  clean in  technique  and style. I  decided to  do so, knowing
that it  would cause  troubles or something like that when  I am going to  meet
a-t- face  to face at EIL. On the one hand I know that it is really resumptuous
to critizise him due to  the fact he's the boss, no question and I should never
do anything like this with  artists that are better than I am. But on the other
hand it might  be interesting  for other readers  how some other artist's views
about a-t-'s graphics  are and that  even  he  is doing (lousy)  mistakes  that
reduces  quality  and respects  both.  As you  might see  now, I am  in a heavy
conflict with myself.

I hope you will forgive me, Kay.

So, about  the motives  of a-t-.  As loading-pic  we  can  see  a.) a  men, b.)
underwater,  c.) with  a lot of tubes and stuff around him and d.) looking kind
of dead. At this point I  wondered were  the compulsory  shark was  situated...
(Ohh, yes!  It is in  some forthcoming Swedish production... (Hehe.)) I realize
a big  monotony in a-t-'s  motives, always showing something with water, divers
and tubes. Fried Bits 3  gfx-compo,  Symposium '96  gfx-compo,  SiliCon render-
compo,  SONO's final pic and more. No question, the motives look brilliant, but
originality  suffers  a  lot  under  this.  At least  I  don't  understand  his
critizism about my everlasting girlie-style in this light.

The  dithering  of the  table  in the  decrunching picture and otherwhere looks
like  convert-dithering. I  got this  confirmed by a  member of the  producer's
group,  so it  not  only looks  like  this, it  really  IS  converted  machine-
dithering.  You  can get this result e.g.  by converting  some  images  into 16
colors  via CrackArt's  loader  option. In my opinion, that's not too much work
and unethical work as well.

Really  strange is  the second  hose from the left in the diver's-picture. This
one is painted in very dark colors to  give the impression of being really near
to the watcher. I realize  that it isn't  antialiased,  or at least antialiased
in a very bad way. There would have been the colors in  the palette  to stretch
the  blur over  the whole  range till the  next  pixel-step.  Very strange a-t-
didn't do this. It spoils the view a bit.

Finally  a point that  was also  mentioned  by other  people when I talked with
them about the  graphics: the  massive HYPE. After  reading weekly  news of the
forthcoming  CREAM production on their homepage, you could think that a-t- will
show up with hardcore  fullscreen  pictures  in 16 colors.  Even after checking
the realtime-article that was sent with the demo, you could be  looking forward
to real  fullscreen smasher  stuffs in  pixel technique.  So after this hype it
was  maybe a  little  bit (only  a really little bit) disappointing to see only
two  pixeled (?) halfscreens.  But  there  cannot  be any doubts that those gfx
belong to the best shown on ST during the last years.

Alright, that's it, you may call me sucker now, Kay. Anyway, keep on keeping ;)


-COBRA: "Generation Gap"
At  first  I wanted  to  write  "No  comment  is a  comment  as well". But this
wouldn't have been fair.

When  I see  "Generation Gap"  I realize a huge waste of skills. The music that
is played  to the  demo belongs to  the best  I've heard over the last years on
Falcon and even the (PhotoShop-) graphic by Orbital is quite okay.

But  the whole effects and  stuff don't fit  to  the music. The  vectors are so
sucky slow that a walz or something like that would have been  better. I really
wonder why  there was no  timing to  this crazy  sound!? Bass orientated vector
zooming, screen  flashes and  other things  would  have  brought at least a bit
design into this production.

You don't  know what  I mean?  Well, I  will give  you  an example.  Just check
the demo till it is  nearly over.  When you  listen to the  music, what do  you
hear then?  Yes, the  whole  music stops  and there  are  only  strange  noises
around.  But  what happens  on screen  at this  time?  There  is  no  change in
effects, nothing, just the oldschool borningness.

The  colors are  mostly  crappy  chosen,  but  I like  the  colors of  the very
first vector right in the beginning of the demo.

Move  the  mouse while the demo is running. Can you hear the greetings from Mr.
Keyclicker?

Black  backgrounds are  laughable, esp. in 1999.  I thought  the scene got over
them 5  years  ago  or so. Same goes for not using the left and right border on
Falcon.

People, start  to put some  design in  your demos! And  design  does  not  only
mean good colors or  timing effects  to the music, but some strange scan-gfx or
stuff. Even coders can scan, so I don't see the problem.

Besides,  I heard  that the demo  contained  the first  routs of COBRA's coder,
so we can only hope that the next demo (-released at EIL?) will get better.

Are seven years enough?
Who knows?
I will.
After the gathering.

VII. Let's Create Your Own End. Hopelessness: Chapter Two.


      There will be no
               loyalty.
                          Except loyalty to The Party.

      There will be no
                  love.
                          Except for love for Big Brother.

      There will be no
              laughter.
                          Except the laugh of triumph over the defeated enemy.


      If you want a picture of the future
      imagine a
      boot
      stamping on a human face.

      Forever.

The curtain's down. And no question's answered.
