                  ñClass 4ğ against ñTitan Designsğ.

The Atari scene is a small scene, but a cosy and cuddly scene. Usually,
almost everybody still doing something on an Atari is well-known and
welcome for what he does.
The òcommercialğ Atari market is not very much larger. The amount of
people left who use the Atari for everday work like óword-processingğ,
óspreadsheetğ, óimage processingğ or ódata-basesğ, is not very much
larger than the number of people in the so-called scene.
In the òsceneğ, this has a major advantage: Every demo released,
every game written is instantly being reviewed, looked at, taken serious
and mostly being appreciated. Additionally, there is very little
competition, just a sensible amount to support creativity. óDHSğ for 
example says in their newest ST demo, òSweetyğ, that without Cream
releasing òdo thingsğ, their ST demo would have never looked the way
it did. On the other hand, òCandymanğ of óCreamğ was carefully watching
the competitions on the ñEIL'99ğ to make sure that his newest demo 
does get along with the demos shown.

On the commercial Atari market, the little competition there is seems
to make people crazy.
Here is where the involved parties are today.

The names are óCore Designğ, formerly known as óTitan Designsğ,
óClass 4ğ, formerly known as óCenTekğ and óSystem Solutionsğ, which is
only indirectly involved in this war.
The rivalry between óCenTekğ and óTitan Designsğ did not exactly start
yesterday. While the people from óCenTekğ in France were busy working
on their ñCenTurboğ-Accelerator, óTitan Designsğ was developing ñNemesisğ.
Although very similar in basic construction, design and performace, the
producing companies did the best to seperate these products.
Both accelerators replace the original Falcon ñ32ğ MHz clock with a
ñ50ğ clock, resulting in a ñ25ğ MHz BUS and CPU speed, optionally in
a ñ50ğ MHz DSP and FPU.
Both accelerators have been reported to have problems, some similar, some
different. Both for example have problems with the òDMAğ, causing Audio-
replay to crackle and SCSI- and Diskaccess to fail once in a while.
Additionally, òNemesisğ sometimes causes problems with some IDE drives
and some memory cards while the òCenTurboğ is known to have problems with
the driver software and the serial and parallel-port.
óTitan Designsğ tried the best they could to get the problems worked out
and offered an excellent user support as well as rather well planned
ñmarketingğ campaign, resulting in òNemesisğ being awarded with ñAtari
hardware-upgrade of the year 1997 and 1998ğ by the ñAtari Timesğ and
óTitan Designsğ being awarded with ñbest Atari supporting company of
the yearğ.
óCenTekğ on the other hand hardly did anything to get their òCenturboğ
sold outside France. Hardly anyone in the UK or Germany saw this speeder
while òNemesisğ was widely available.

Additionally, óSystem Solutionsğ got angry as well. òNemesisğ after all
was a low-cost accelerator that offered some kind of reliability, that
the òBlow Up FXğ card didn't offer for a much higher price. Since
òNemesisğ was a óTitan Designsğ development and óSystem Solutionsğ
therefore couldn't sell the óFX cardğ anymore in large numbers.
Another rivalry comes up.

It wasn't very long after òNemesisğ that óCenTekğ announced the òCenTurbo 2ğ.
My french is not very good, but as far as i can see it, the first 
announcement of the òCenTurbo 2ğ was intended to have a ñ75ğ MHz CPU and
i also assume it was intended to be an ñ68040ğ-system. It was supposed to
run ñDolmenğ and early ratings with the ñDolmen VDIğ, that could be run
under TOS, were displayed.
After all, when the òCenTurbo 2ğ came out, it was a ñ50 MHz 68030ğ system,
offering up to ò32 MBğ FastRAM, including an ñFPU-socketğ as well as a
ñCombelğ and an integrated ñCenTurbo 1ğ.
This basically is a computer in itself on the Falcon port and can therefore
speed the system up to ó4 - 9ğ times, depending on what application you run.
The òCenTurbo 2ğ was advertised in the rest of europe this time as well with
óSystem Solutionsğ selling it in the UK and óSeidelğ and óAG Computertechnikğ
distributing it in Germany.
So far, 192 units have been sold and with people still ordering them, it 
looks like the Revision B of the òCT2ğ, that even accepts up to ñ64 MBğ
FastRAM, is going to be a full success as well.

óTitan Designsğ had no answer to that yet.
The òAfterburner040ğ, a CPU-replacement that also offered FastRAM, was sold
out and could not be produced anymore. Besides, it was very expensive and
without an additional busspeeder like òNemesisğ, it only offered a speedup 
of the factor 4 as well - if the software ran at all, because the òAB040ğ,
was not very compatible at all.
Luckily, óTitan Designsğ joined forces with óIstari Softwareğ in Sweden
to start a new series of hardware-add-ons for the Falcon: ñF-Maxğ.
The first project, òEclipseğ, is basically a ñPCI-Adapterğ for the Falcon.
PCI-Graphic cards like being used in the Milan could be driven on a Falcon
then as well as Ultra-SCSI cards or network cards.
òTempestğ is another long-term project, that will probably introduce the
Motorola ñPowerPCğ technology into the Atari market as òTempestğ is equipped
with a ñ100ğ MHz or optionally even a ñ266ğ MHz ò603e PPCğ and up to ñ256 MBğ
FastRAM.
Nevertheless, òEclipseğ is currently being produced and òTempestğ is in
Prototype state.

All those accelerators and upgrade-cards have one thing in common:
They all plug into the òFalcon-extensionğ port, located around the CPU.

And this is where the problems arised.
The òCenTurbo 2ğ does, in contrast to every other speeder so far, no
expansion through port that allows connecting another card into the
Falcon extension port.

And óBang!ğ they all go crazy.
In the latest press release, óCore Designğ announced that they changed
their name from òTitan Designsğ to óCore Designğ and also the lack of
an expansion through port of the òCenTurbo 2ğ-card would make the usage
of òEclipseğ impossible since òEclipseğ has definetly no expansion through
port. Additionally, òTitan Designsğ assumed problems with this port and
that óCenTekğ now skips it because of these problems.
óCenTekğ reacted in a very offended/offensive way. First they renamed 
themselves to óClass 4ğ, which sounds a little too close to óPhase 5ğ
in my eyes, a german company that made the first PowerPC accelerator cards
for the Amiga and is famous there, and wrote a long and very offensive ñreplyğ
to óTitan Designsğ' press release.
The basic points of the reply was
- there is no problem with the expansion through port, òClass 4ğ never had
  any problems
- óTitan Designsğ sucks because
  - òNemesisğ had a lot of problems, affirmed by neutral and very reliable
    dealers in europe
  - óTempestğ, based on a Coldfire 5102 would be totally incompatible, not
    allow to run MiNT, MagiC, Linux because of the lack of PMMU and not 
    POV-Ray because of the lack of the FPU
  - òTempestğ, based on a PowerPC would be even more totally incompatible,
    and besides almost impossible because óTitan Designsğ does not know
    anything about developing hardware
  - It is possible to use òEclipseğ together with the òCenTurbo 2ğ as
    òEclipseğ should have an expansion through port the óct2ğ can be
    put on
  - òTempestğ and òEclipseğ are being advertised as "under development"
    for so long now
- Get your facts right, óCore Designğ

In a rather insulting way, óClass 4ğ rants about óCore Designğ not knowing
anything about hardware, not doing any sensible research, spreading lies
in objection to obvious facts and so on ...

It took óCore Designğ more than a week to reply to that.
Nevertheless, it was a typical ñDavid Encillğ-press release. In a 
distincive, noble, slightly insulted manner, óCore Designğ takes point for 
point of the óClass 4ğ press release and comments on it.

The basic points of the reply were
- òCenturbo 2 Rev.Bğ does not have an expansion through port, this is a 
  fact, not a lie
- òNemesisğ was received well by the public and most problems occured
  because of improper installation
- The reliable dealer that óClass 4ğ mentions to affirm the òNemesisğ-
  problems is óSystems Solutionsğ, which is - of course - not happy about
  not being able to send the òFX cardğ anymore.
- All debates of the ñColdfire 5102ğ as a replacement CPU are outdated
  since this project is skipped, nevertheless
  - No PMMU just means that MiNT does not run in protected mode while
    MagiC, Geneva and SingleTOS run, Linux being currently developed for
    Non-PMMU machines
  - No FPU just means some programs slow down because software emulation
    of the FPU is possible
  - The Coldfire 5102 is cheaper and faster than an original 68040
- A lot of research has been done on the usage of a ñPowerPCğ in an Atari
  and a prototype is running
- Is there a Phenix prototype running ?
- Doesn't óClass 4ğ advertise the Phenix as "under development" for 2 years
  now ?
- òEclipseğ does not have an Expansion through port as graphic cards never
  do. Accelerator on the other hand are supposed to.
- Get your facts right, óClass 4ğ

Here ends the live report from the battle-field.
But this wouldn't be a ñParanoidğ-article without a very subjective and
personal comment on these quarrels. ;-)

I wonder why everybody dislikes óCore Designğ.
óClass 4ğ obviously dislikes them, because if not, a simple
"Centurbo 2 does not feature an Expansion through port anymore as there
is now hardware available anymore to use it with. If Eclipse does feature
an Expansion through port, the usage of them both is of course possible."
would have done it.
But they didn't reply this way.
They wrote a 6 page letter about what óCore Designğ has done wrong in the
past, what they are doing wrong now and what they will do wrong in the near
future. About their superior knowledge about hardware, processors and
accelerators and about the lack of this knowledge on óCore Designsğ side.
About that óCore Designğ only advertises products that are not available
yet while óClass 4ğ products are available.
So either óClass 4ğ's marketing division is extremely bored and in a bad
mood or they dislike óCore designğ.

óSystem Solutionsğ does not seem to like óCore Designğ much either.
Some of the people working for óSystem Solutionsğ miss no opportunity
unpassed to throw mud at óCore Designğ, complaining that they sell their
hard- or software too cheap and therefore ruining the prices on a market
where every penny is extremely hard to earn, moaning that óCore Designğ
imports hardware from europe they are not allowed to distribute in the UK
and so on ...

I admit that my view is not objective, as óCore Designğ surely has its
bad sides as well. For example, most of the hardware or software they
sell is still quite expensive for the german market. They announce
products - like every company does - and in the end can't deliver yet or
probably not at all (Expose and Nemesis for example are no longer made).
User support is sometimes a bit "edgy", when for example harddisks are
being sold that are not capable of being booted on a Falcon and can 
therefore only work as a secondary drive.
I also admit that i am a little involved into their doings as i usually
translate the manuals, beta-test the soft- and hardware and negotiate
between the german master-distributor óAxel Gehringerğ and óCore Designğ
directly.

Nevertheless, óCore Designğ has not deserved this kind of treatment in
my eyes. Because, when looking back in time a little, óTitan Designsğ
was always good for a surprise.
When for example the Falcon was released, it was òApexğ from óBlack Scorpionğ
and óTitan Designsğ that displayed the abilities of the Falcon well and
got it mentioned in magazines that ignored it so far - òApexğ still is
one of the most popular art packages on the Falcon.
When òScreen eyeğ turned out to be a flop and was only shipped in very
small scales, it was óTitan Designsğ that developed òExposeğ, a real-time
video-digitizer for the Falcon.
When the òFX-cardğ showed how hard and expensive it is to accelerate the
Falcon, it was óTitan Designsğ, whose òNemesisğ accelerator was quick,
cheap, and relatively reliable.
When the òAfterburner040ğ was finally shipped and not very compatible at
all, it was ñDoug Littleğ of óBlack Scorpion/Titan Designsğ that sold it
with a set of patches that increased compatibility a lot.

Of course, óClass 4ğ has done an excellent job as well. The òCenTurbo 2ğ
is a very capable accelerator, that remains at a very high compatibility
level along with relatively high performance.
The òCenTurbo 1ğ was probably neither worse nor better than ñNemesisğ,
just a little different, with differents pros and different cons.
Finally, the òPhenixğ will probably be the best computer ever built
based on a ñMotorola 680x0ğ and therefore suit a lot of Atari programmers 
and users.

In the same way, óSystem Solutionsğ has done a lot of good things to
support the Atari platform. Most important, they support the english
magazine ñAtari Computingğ heavily. They translate and distribute the
software of ñApplication Software Heidelbergğ in the UK along with
the òSoundpoolğ hard- and software.

But the argument brought up by óClass 4ğ now is ridiculous.
Do they have to waste a lot of energy for accusing óCore Designğ of 
something which is of no importance ? What does it matter if the 5102 is 
compatible or not ? It has been skipped anyway. And what does it matter
if Nemesis has had some problems ? It's not a product currently being
released and advertised. And what does it matter if Tempest containing
a PowerPC might be less compatible ? It is not being shipped yet, changes 
can still be done, and after all, it's óCore Designğ's problem, not
óClass 4'sğ.
This whole argument is silly, pointless and leads nobody anywhere.
It's a waste of time.
Obsolete.
Senseless.
Totally unnecessary.

Even my whole article about it is completely senseless and unnecessary. ;-)

Therefore i stop it here with a request:
Stop that stupid flame-war.
Concentrate on your projects, óClass 4ğ and óCore Designğ. 
That's where your strong points are. The guys from óClass 4ğ obviously
displayed that they are not very good at taking criticism. óCore Designğ has 
displayed that they can defend themselves very well.
But this is óNOTğ what i expect from those 2 companies.

I expect hardware to be devloped.
So instead of arguing about unfinished projects and their specs, let the
customer argue about finished projects. Finish the Phenix, release Eclipse,
hurry up with Tempest.
Because only when these projects are finished, produced and being shipped,
arguments of this kind are objective and based on facts, and then, the 
competition will be a fair one.
Then the people will tell you if Tempest is too incompatible, if the Phenix
is worth its money, if Eclipse is usefull or not.

Anything else is talking about "unlaid eggs".
And we could as well debate about the Atari Microbox040 or a hypothetical
Atari Vulture 080 ... It would make as much sense as all this.

I'm out of here, and i still support óCore Designğ as far as i can. :-)
