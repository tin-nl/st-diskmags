                  ñClass 4ð against ñTitan Designsð.

The Atari scene is a small scene, but a cosy and cuddly scene. Usually,
almost everybody still doing something on an Atari is well-known and
welcome for what he does.
The òcommercialð Atari market is not very much larger. The amount of
people left who use the Atari for everday work like óword-processingð,
óspreadsheetð, óimage processingð or ódata-basesð, is not very much
larger than the number of people in the so-called scene.
In the òsceneð, this has a major advantage: Every demo released,
every game written is instantly being reviewed, looked at, taken serious
and mostly being appreciated. Additionally, there is very little
competition, just a sensible amount to support creativity. óDHSð for 
example says in their newest ST demo, òSweetyð, that without Cream
releasing òdo thingsð, their ST demo would have never looked the way
it did. On the other hand, òCandymanð of óCreamð was carefully watching
the competitions on the ñEIL'99ð to make sure that his newest demo 
does get along with the demos shown.

On the commercial Atari market, the little competition there is seems
to make people crazy.
Here is where the involved parties are today.

The names are óCore Designð, formerly known as óTitan Designsð,
óClass 4ð, formerly known as óCenTekð and óSystem Solutionsð, which is
only indirectly involved in this war.
The rivalry between óCenTekð and óTitan Designsð did not exactly start
yesterday. While the people from óCenTekð in France were busy working
on their ñCenTurboð-Accelerator, óTitan Designsð was developing ñNemesisð.
Although very similar in basic construction, design and performace, the
producing companies did the best to seperate these products.
Both accelerators replace the original Falcon ñ32ð MHz clock with a
ñ50ð clock, resulting in a ñ25ð MHz BUS and CPU speed, optionally in
a ñ50ð MHz DSP and FPU.
Both accelerators have been reported to have problems, some similar, some
different. Both for example have problems with the òDMAð, causing Audio-
replay to crackle and SCSI- and Diskaccess to fail once in a while.
Additionally, òNemesisð sometimes causes problems with some IDE drives
and some memory cards while the òCenTurboð is known to have problems with
the driver software and the serial and parallel-port.
óTitan Designsð tried the best they could to get the problems worked out
and offered an excellent user support as well as rather well planned
ñmarketingð campaign, resulting in òNemesisð being awarded with ñAtari
hardware-upgrade of the year 1997 and 1998ð by the ñAtari Timesð and
óTitan Designsð being awarded with ñbest Atari supporting company of
the yearð.
óCenTekð on the other hand hardly did anything to get their òCenturboð
sold outside France. Hardly anyone in the UK or Germany saw this speeder
while òNemesisð was widely available.

Additionally, óSystem Solutionsð got angry as well. òNemesisð after all
was a low-cost accelerator that offered some kind of reliability, that
the òBlow Up FXð card didn't offer for a much higher price. Since
òNemesisð was a óTitan Designsð development and óSystem Solutionsð
therefore couldn't sell the óFX cardð anymore in large numbers.
Another rivalry comes up.

It wasn't very long after òNemesisð that óCenTekð announced the òCenTurbo 2ð.
My french is not very good, but as far as i can see it, the first 
announcement of the òCenTurbo 2ð was intended to have a ñ75ð MHz CPU and
i also assume it was intended to be an ñ68040ð-system. It was supposed to
run ñDolmenð and early ratings with the ñDolmen VDIð, that could be run
under TOS, were displayed.
After all, when the òCenTurbo 2ð came out, it was a ñ50 MHz 68030ð system,
offering up to ò32 MBð FastRAM, including an ñFPU-socketð as well as a
ñCombelð and an integrated ñCenTurbo 1ð.
This basically is a computer in itself on the Falcon port and can therefore
speed the system up to ó4 - 9ð times, depending on what application you run.
The òCenTurbo 2ð was advertised in the rest of europe this time as well with
óSystem Solutionsð selling it in the UK and óSeidelð and óAG Computertechnikð
distributing it in Germany.
So far, 192 units have been sold and with people still ordering them, it 
looks like the Revision B of the òCT2ð, that even accepts up to ñ64 MBð
FastRAM, is going to be a full success as well.

óTitan Designsð had no answer to that yet.
The òAfterburner040ð, a CPU-replacement that also offered FastRAM, was sold
out and could not be produced anymore. Besides, it was very expensive and
without an additional busspeeder like òNemesisð, it only offered a speedup 
of the factor 4 as well - if the software ran at all, because the òAB040ð,
was not very compatible at all.
Luckily, óTitan Designsð joined forces with óIstari Softwareð in Sweden
to start a new series of hardware-add-ons for the Falcon: ñF-Maxð.
The first project, òEclipseð, is basically a ñPCI-Adapterð for the Falcon.
PCI-Graphic cards like being used in the Milan could be driven on a Falcon
then as well as Ultra-SCSI cards or network cards.
òTempestð is another long-term project, that will probably introduce the
Motorola ñPowerPCð technology into the Atari market as òTempestð is equipped
with a ñ100ð MHz or optionally even a ñ266ð MHz ò603e PPCð and up to ñ256 MBð
FastRAM.
Nevertheless, òEclipseð is currently being produced and òTempestð is in
Prototype state.

All those accelerators and upgrade-cards have one thing in common:
They all plug into the òFalcon-extensionð port, located around the CPU.

And this is where the problems arised.
The òCenTurbo 2ð does, in contrast to every other speeder so far, no
expansion through port that allows connecting another card into the
Falcon extension port.

And óBang!ð they all go crazy.
In the latest press release, óCore Designð announced that they changed
their name from òTitan Designsð to óCore Designð and also the lack of
an expansion through port of the òCenTurbo 2ð-card would make the usage
of òEclipseð impossible since òEclipseð has definetly no expansion through
port. Additionally, òTitan Designsð assumed problems with this port and
that óCenTekð now skips it because of these problems.
óCenTekð reacted in a very offended/offensive way. First they renamed 
themselves to óClass 4ð, which sounds a little too close to óPhase 5ð
in my eyes, a german company that made the first PowerPC accelerator cards
for the Amiga and is famous there, and wrote a long and very offensive ñreplyð
to óTitan Designsð' press release.
The basic points of the reply was
- there is no problem with the expansion through port, òClass 4ð never had
  any problems
- óTitan Designsð sucks because
  - òNemesisð had a lot of problems, affirmed by neutral and very reliable
    dealers in europe
  - óTempestð, based on a Coldfire 5102 would be totally incompatible, not
    allow to run MiNT, MagiC, Linux because of the lack of PMMU and not 
    POV-Ray because of the lack of the FPU
  - òTempestð, based on a PowerPC would be even more totally incompatible,
    and besides almost impossible because óTitan Designsð does not know
    anything about developing hardware
  - It is possible to use òEclipseð together with the òCenTurbo 2ð as
    òEclipseð should have an expansion through port the óct2ð can be
    put on
  - òTempestð and òEclipseð are being advertised as "under development"
    for so long now
- Get your facts right, óCore Designð

In a rather insulting way, óClass 4ð rants about óCore Designð not knowing
anything about hardware, not doing any sensible research, spreading lies
in objection to obvious facts and so on ...

It took óCore Designð more than a week to reply to that.
Nevertheless, it was a typical ñDavid Encillð-press release. In a 
distincive, noble, slightly insulted manner, óCore Designð takes point for 
point of the óClass 4ð press release and comments on it.

The basic points of the reply were
- òCenturbo 2 Rev.Bð does not have an expansion through port, this is a 
  fact, not a lie
- òNemesisð was received well by the public and most problems occured
  because of improper installation
- The reliable dealer that óClass 4ð mentions to affirm the òNemesisð-
  problems is óSystems Solutionsð, which is - of course - not happy about
  not being able to send the òFX cardð anymore.
- All debates of the ñColdfire 5102ð as a replacement CPU are outdated
  since this project is skipped, nevertheless
  - No PMMU just means that MiNT does not run in protected mode while
    MagiC, Geneva and SingleTOS run, Linux being currently developed for
    Non-PMMU machines
  - No FPU just means some programs slow down because software emulation
    of the FPU is possible
  - The Coldfire 5102 is cheaper and faster than an original 68040
- A lot of research has been done on the usage of a ñPowerPCð in an Atari
  and a prototype is running
- Is there a Phenix prototype running ?
- Doesn't óClass 4ð advertise the Phenix as "under development" for 2 years
  now ?
- òEclipseð does not have an Expansion through port as graphic cards never
  do. Accelerator on the other hand are supposed to.
- Get your facts right, óClass 4ð

Here ends the live report from the battle-field.
But this wouldn't be a ñParanoidð-article without a very subjective and
personal comment on these quarrels. ;-)

I wonder why everybody dislikes óCore Designð.
óClass 4ð obviously dislikes them, because if not, a simple
"Centurbo 2 does not feature an Expansion through port anymore as there
is now hardware available anymore to use it with. If Eclipse does feature
an Expansion through port, the usage of them both is of course possible."
would have done it.
But they didn't reply this way.
They wrote a 6 page letter about what óCore Designð has done wrong in the
past, what they are doing wrong now and what they will do wrong in the near
future. About their superior knowledge about hardware, processors and
accelerators and about the lack of this knowledge on óCore Designsð side.
About that óCore Designð only advertises products that are not available
yet while óClass 4ð products are available.
So either óClass 4ð's marketing division is extremely bored and in a bad
mood or they dislike óCore designð.

óSystem Solutionsð does not seem to like óCore Designð much either.
Some of the people working for óSystem Solutionsð miss no opportunity
unpassed to throw mud at óCore Designð, complaining that they sell their
hard- or software too cheap and therefore ruining the prices on a market
where every penny is extremely hard to earn, moaning that óCore Designð
imports hardware from europe they are not allowed to distribute in the UK
and so on ...

I admit that my view is not objective, as óCore Designð surely has its
bad sides as well. For example, most of the hardware or software they
sell is still quite expensive for the german market. They announce
products - like every company does - and in the end can't deliver yet or
probably not at all (Expose and Nemesis for example are no longer made).
User support is sometimes a bit "edgy", when for example harddisks are
being sold that are not capable of being booted on a Falcon and can 
therefore only work as a secondary drive.
I also admit that i am a little involved into their doings as i usually
translate the manuals, beta-test the soft- and hardware and negotiate
between the german master-distributor óAxel Gehringerð and óCore Designð
directly.

Nevertheless, óCore Designð has not deserved this kind of treatment in
my eyes. Because, when looking back in time a little, óTitan Designsð
was always good for a surprise.
When for example the Falcon was released, it was òApexð from óBlack Scorpionð
and óTitan Designsð that displayed the abilities of the Falcon well and
got it mentioned in magazines that ignored it so far - òApexð still is
one of the most popular art packages on the Falcon.
When òScreen eyeð turned out to be a flop and was only shipped in very
small scales, it was óTitan Designsð that developed òExposeð, a real-time
video-digitizer for the Falcon.
When the òFX-cardð showed how hard and expensive it is to accelerate the
Falcon, it was óTitan Designsð, whose òNemesisð accelerator was quick,
cheap, and relatively reliable.
When the òAfterburner040ð was finally shipped and not very compatible at
all, it was ñDoug Littleð of óBlack Scorpion/Titan Designsð that sold it
with a set of patches that increased compatibility a lot.

Of course, óClass 4ð has done an excellent job as well. The òCenTurbo 2ð
is a very capable accelerator, that remains at a very high compatibility
level along with relatively high performance.
The òCenTurbo 1ð was probably neither worse nor better than ñNemesisð,
just a little different, with differents pros and different cons.
Finally, the òPhenixð will probably be the best computer ever built
based on a ñMotorola 680x0ð and therefore suit a lot of Atari programmers 
and users.

In the same way, óSystem Solutionsð has done a lot of good things to
support the Atari platform. Most important, they support the english
magazine ñAtari Computingð heavily. They translate and distribute the
software of ñApplication Software Heidelbergð in the UK along with
the òSoundpoolð hard- and software.

But the argument brought up by óClass 4ð now is ridiculous.
Do they have to waste a lot of energy for accusing óCore Designð of 
something which is of no importance ? What does it matter if the 5102 is 
compatible or not ? It has been skipped anyway. And what does it matter
if Nemesis has had some problems ? It's not a product currently being
released and advertised. And what does it matter if Tempest containing
a PowerPC might be less compatible ? It is not being shipped yet, changes 
can still be done, and after all, it's óCore Designð's problem, not
óClass 4'sð.
This whole argument is silly, pointless and leads nobody anywhere.
It's a waste of time.
Obsolete.
Senseless.
Totally unnecessary.

Even my whole article about it is completely senseless and unnecessary. ;-)

Therefore i stop it here with a request:
Stop that stupid flame-war.
Concentrate on your projects, óClass 4ð and óCore Designð. 
That's where your strong points are. The guys from óClass 4ð obviously
displayed that they are not very good at taking criticism. óCore Designð has 
displayed that they can defend themselves very well.
But this is óNOTð what i expect from those 2 companies.

I expect hardware to be devloped.
So instead of arguing about unfinished projects and their specs, let the
customer argue about finished projects. Finish the Phenix, release Eclipse,
hurry up with Tempest.
Because only when these projects are finished, produced and being shipped,
arguments of this kind are objective and based on facts, and then, the 
competition will be a fair one.
Then the people will tell you if Tempest is too incompatible, if the Phenix
is worth its money, if Eclipse is usefull or not.

Anything else is talking about "unlaid eggs".
And we could as well debate about the Atari Microbox040 or a hypothetical
Atari Vulture 080 ... It would make as much sense as all this.

I'm out of here, and i still support óCore Designð as far as i can. :-)
