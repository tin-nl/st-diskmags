          Most of us had been waiting for this sound disk without really 
      believing it would eventually come out one  day... Also, as the ST 
      fanatic I am I kept wondering what a soundtrack by 505 could sound 
      like 8-) Hail Checkpoint then, because  after Modulation 1 and 3 - 
      released on Falcon - Modulation 2 hits the ST scene ! 

          Over the last months Defjam has been incredibly productive and 
      so we could expect high quality as ever. Ok I can  tell  you right 
      now : the intro is explosive !! It starts with a nice soundchip by 
      505 while a 'M' letter is zooming in. It features gouraud shading, 
      maybe another sort  of texture because it  looks strange. Also the 
      colors  range from blue to  pink (??). The object then  rotates in 
      different ways, always with the texture of course. A 'II' comes to 
      complete the scene and dance with the 'M'. The window is small but 
      the effect looks great. There  are also two  vertical bars on each 
      side of  the  screen > dezign rules 8-) To add  more complexity, a 
      'MODULATION 2' is displayed at the bottom of the screen zooming in 
      and out and distorting too. The mapped letters vanish and the bars 
      are deleted in rythm  with the music. A few flashes and we move to 
      the second part which is really òINCREDIBLE !!!!!!!ğ

          Ah I can breathe again... On a blue background cells (yes like 
      human cells, remember biology lessons ??) appear and mix together, 
      but they're not just normal cells because they're made of ñFIREğ !!! 
      They mix  thus creating  light effects... It goes so fast !!! Much 
      faster than Drooling  or Birthtro which were already amazing ! And 
      it's not over yet. They gather into weird shapes fly apart  again. 
      The a CHECKPOINT logo zooms in, in fire too, the cells mix with it 
      too and it  rotates while  zooming in even closer and then back... 
      Pfouuu  enough please !! It is also deformed by a sort of * ówaveğ * 
      effect but it's hard to describe... Gradually the cell get smaller 
      and  finally disappear. A  small 'please wait' is  displayed while 
      the main part is loaded.

          The main menu appears with color flashes and a nice CHECKPOINT 
      logo painted by Moondog/pOd appears in an  original way. The lower 
      part  of  the screen  features a nice 'M2' mapped rotating letters 
      (reminds me of some MTV jingles) and a box with  info, options and 
      a list of soundtracks to  choose from. In the middle of the screen 
      are  classical  but  nice  spectrum  analizer lines. I  forgot  to 
      mention the unescapable horizontal scrolltext at the bottom of the 
      screen.

          Nothing special to be mentioned  about the credits and options 
      boxes. You can get info about  the songs such as  size, length and 
      messages from 505. We learn  in the config  box that there are two 
      players : one  for  ST and  the  other for  Falcon. But  we deeply 
      regret there is no player for STe because the ST replay quality is 
      rather low - about 14Khz -..... Too bad !

          On the good side  of news I can  tell you that  this sounddisk 
      features not  less than * ó12ğ *  soundtracks : among them Blockade, 
      Exploding, Such Hate, We  are  Here, Always, Jassi, Frozen  Dreams 
      and others. Of course giving you the names is useless so let's try 
      to get a closer  look at  them. Some  tunes like * Frozen Dreams * 
      are  fairly  quiet  while  others  like * Jassi * are  more  tekno 
      inspired melodies but they all have one thing  in common : they're 
      * òGREATğ *. No doubt 505 shows us he's as good a chip musician as a 
      soundtrack composer ! What could  I say more ? Even  though I'm no 
      tekno fan I must  say I often run the demo to feel the calmness or 
      hardbeat  feeling of  some or  other tune, in other  words another 
      sounddisk * with óDO THINGSğ * that you ñMUSTğ get !


          òBottom Line :ğ
          ò-------------ğ

          The only negative point  is surely the  average quality of the 
      STf replayer, esp when you run the demo on your beloved STe 8-(((( 
      But the intro is a typical Checkpoint  production > butt kicking ! 
      And when we listen to the numerous  musics  composed by the highly 
      talented 505 we  just forget  about the replay  quality and simply 
      say... òThank You !ğ
