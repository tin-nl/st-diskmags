          Here is - at last - the last ST contribution  presented at the 
      compo of Error In Line. I dont' want to seem disrespectful or what 
      but I think there was a lot of * òundeservedð * hype surrounding the 
      release of this 1993-94 production... And I don't get why the hell 
      it was considered  better than * ñSweetieð * by DHS (maybe some guys 
      were too  tired when they voted 8-) but it  doesn't mean this demo 
      is crap either.

          So this is an old unreleased demo by óSTAXð. It was presented at 
      Eil but for some reason it wasn't  released until April 19th which 
      means that Stax òdidn't respect  the deadlineð... Anyway let's focus 
      on the review instead.

          Once you've run the small prg (150 Kb only 8-() you're given a 
      typical oldschool screen with a white  horizontal split on top and 
      a blue one at the bottom. Besides the design thing it implies that 
      all fx are displayed in a ñsmall windowð... The music is an old chip 
      by Scanvenger who was a great  chip musician, yet the music sounds 
      buggy and sometimes you really feel like turning the volume down.

          The demo is divided into 3 parts as follows :

          òPart oneð : ñVectorsð
          ò--------ð

          Nothing really stunning just a few 3D objects such as a yellow 
      pyramid, a red cube, a green star, a starship rotating over a STAX 
      logo... It's smooth but  the objects aren't that  big and when you 
      remember * òSynergyð * last demo  you cannot but  be disappointed by 
      this part. The last effect here is a gouraud shaded pyramid. Nice.


          òPart twoð : ñbitmapsð
          ò--------ð

          First comes a scroller zoomer  that looks like the effect that 
      can be found in the sooo rich multipart of the * óFroggies Over theð 
     óFence ð*. It quickly fades away replaced by a cute mapped cube with 
      Penguins (the Linux mascot 8-) on all the faces. The resolution is 
      pretty crappy  and the cube not  so big. It  ends up with a plasma 
      tunnel that also looks damm old !

   
          òPart threeð : ñmoving worldsð
          ò----------ð

          Surely the most  interesting part  of this  definitely antique 
      looking demo... First we're  presented with a óWolfenstein worldð in 
      a small window. All the walls are covered with the Penguin motive. 
      It looks cool and you can  even use the directional keys to choose 
      your destination. The following  screen is another valuable effort 
      as it features a óMode 7 demonstration !ð Remember the Super Famicom 
      (or Super Nintendo depending on  your country) capability to use a 
      mode 7 for games like F-Zero or Mario Kart ? Well then you'll feel 
      familiar with this version of Mario Kart on ST ! You can drive and 
      control your small car  using a joystick. Obviously this technical 
      effect suffers  from  one thing : a very small window size... Last 
      but not least is a voxel wolrd with  mountains and meadows. Though 
      it pixellises a lot it still looks great !

 
          The very last screen  features a green vector ball object with 
      some confusing credits (I'll never manage to know who did what). A 
      clown is shown, he says bye and you're back to the gem. The End...

         ñBottom lineð : I remember seeing  this demo at Eil on the giant 
         ñ-----------ð   screen and I  liked it a lot  but I was terribly 
       disappointed  when I watched it again on my St monitor. Looks damm 
       old and unfinished. Better than nothing but it  òcannotð be compared 
       with the three other ST releases of Eil. But if you're an addicted 
       nostalgic get it - even if in my opinion * ñVirtual Escapeð * is THE 
       nostalgic demo - otherwise don't bother downloading it.
