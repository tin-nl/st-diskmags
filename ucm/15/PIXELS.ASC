          Since mOd had left - not for long  hopefully - the position of 
      Graphic Advisor, I've been asked to write a little something about 
      my painting methods and  tricks. Well you'll see  that there is no 
      miracle to improve but to keep  working and  to speak the  truth I 
      don't consider myself such a great artist...

          And as I write this I  realize that  this article  will surely 
      look dull without any ñAsciið òartð ódecorationsð, esp compared to mOd's 
      articles, but erm sorry guys I've  never  been familiar with using 
      Ascii characters to  paint things 8-( But if everything is ok this 
      article should be illustrated with several graphic examples.


      ñLet's have it started !!ð
      ò------------------------ð

          The first and òcompulsaryð step of any kind of work is of course 
      done in  your mind and  heart. What  I mean  is that  before doing 
      anything you must  have an  idea  about what  you are going to do. 
      Personnally I often start with  drawing  on plain  paper or try to 
      imagine what I could paint (when I  am not simply trying to copy a 
      picture). I think it  is always easier than  running your favorite
      painting programm and  wait  for a  great idea  to pop up 8-) Then 
      it's up to you to spend minutes or hours designing  your vision on 
      paper but I think it often helps to design a picture. Also you can 
      already think about the colors you are going to use.

          Ok you've got it now ? Oh and by the way ówhich programð are you 
      familiar with ? About four years  ago I started  with Deluxe Paint 
      when I came up with the great Crack Art I quickly changed my mind. 
      I don't think there're just * ñcrappyð * softs and * òawesomeð * ones, 
      they're  quite all different and you  sure have to  try a few ones 
      before making your decision... I  think classics are Deluxe Paint, 
      Neochrome, Degas Elite for the "old" ones and also Synthetics Arts 
      or Crack Art for more recent ones. These 5 softs are enough to get 
      what YOU want from your mouse. I work with Crack Art v1.36 because 
      it features a cool  realtime  "magnifier" (more friendly than most 
      others) and loads of options  like  dithering, distortion  effects 
      and many more. It also offers an automatic antialiasing option but 
      never let your computer do that kind of job for you !!!!


           ó1. Turn your Computer Onð 
           ñ------------------------ð

          Ok we're ready : we've got the idea and the  adequate software 
      whose various  options you know by heart 8-) Then get prepared for 
      the most important step : óthe first try !ð 

          After years of tortures I have adopted the  following method : 
      using lines, circles and  different sizes  of squares,..., I first 
      design the ñvery basic  shapes of my  future pictureð. As an example 
      I'm going to use an unused  SYNTAX logo (I  have changed the shape 
      and used it as a logo for another  band, we'll see  if some of you 
      can recognize it when it is released by early April ;-).
 
 
  {*i example1.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}
  
 
          As you can see the first try only features ò1 colorð and believe 
      me it is far enough ! Once you've got  the basic shape you have to 
      delete all the lines that are not needed and correct the others. I 
      also suggest you start  correcting a  few curves now. The shape of 
      your picture will mainly be  determined during  this step so don't 
      panic if you spend 2  hours only  working on it ! This is when you 
      are going to  build up your picture therefore  make sure that most 
      proportions are ok. This is a very long and sometimes  boring work 
      but  it  proves  óvery  useful laterð. Once you  are satisfied  with 
      the result you can start painting and move to step 2.


           2. òColorsð ñIn Yourð óEyesð
           ó--------------------------ð

          Even before trying to  correct these  nasty pixels you have to 
      choose your  palette. I often  start with  deciding whether I will 
      use the full palette or just 8 colors and so on. I like to do both 
      types  of pictures, smaller ones can be  displayed along with a fx 
      and so you have to  try and save as  many colors as possible. Also 
      as a challenge I  sometimes try to  paint logos with  only four or 
      five colors (old issues of Toxic Mag feature midres logos I made). 
      the first color to be chosen is the background - aka color 0 - and 
      please don't be amazed because I'm telling you that the background 
      doesn't have to be ñblackð !!!

          Oh and by the way, even though I have an STe, I only work with 
      STf palettes. You could argue that Crack Art  doesn't allow to use 
      the extended palette  of the STe and... you are right ! But I have 
      grown used to  working like this and  with a little experience you 
      can - more or less - easily forget this  limitation. On this point 
      too Crack Art is very helpful  since it comes  with 20 preselected 
      palettes. Not that you have to work with them but it shows you how 
      to arrange colors to obtain a smooth dithering.

          Back to the palette : once  you  have  chosen the 0 color (and 
      once again try to forget this òstupidð ñdumbð black tradition !!), you 
      can reserve the second color. It  will have to be quite similar to 
      the background, let's say a little brighter only. This way you can 
      be sure your painting will < naturally > integrate the background. 
      Then of course you  make your  own choice  of colors. You can move 
      each component by one (ie +1 red, +1 green and +1 blue) and that's 
      enough ! You can also pick up closer colors with the same "amount" 
      of red, green or blue. 

      Here is my detailed palette which uses ó10 colorsð (background incl)

                 Red  | Green |  Blue
      * color 0 :       1       0        2
      * color 1 :       1       0        3
      * color 2 :       2       1        3
      * color 3 :       3       1        4
      * color 4 :       3       2        4
      * color 5 :       4       3        5
      * color 6 :       5       4        6
      * color 7 :       5       5        6
      * color 8 :       6       5        7
      * color 9 :       6       6        7


          Back to my messy explanation : some colors, like color 5 and 6 
      have  increased  by  one (ie from 324 to 435  and from 435 to 546) 
      while others have only seen one  of their  component go  up by one 
      (eg from 102 to 103 or 657 to 667). Oupf, not easy to explain !!!! 
      But I hope you get it. It  shows that with  an STf palette you can 
      get nice colors provided you  chose them carefully. Again there is 
      ñno  miracleð  you  will  have  to try  many different combinations. 
      However you can note that you  get smoother  colors when  you only 
      modify  the  blue  component. Obviously it  won't  work  with  all 
      colors. So how can the magic work ??? Haha welcome to step 3 !


           ò3. My Eyes Areð ñKillingð óMeð
           ñ-----------------------------ð

          This step is for tough pixel warriors only !! Actually you are 
      going to kill your  eyes, sitting  in a  dark room, tracking  down 
      every little pixel that doesn't fit. it takes  time  and patience, 
      so don't expect to have a social life anymore 8-)

          I would say that the * ñmostð * difficult thing when it comes to 
      dithering and antialiasing is to generate * òorganized chaosð * : an 
      ordered dithering would be horrible as if... the whole picture had 
      gone through a  mechanical, heartless  process. This is the reason 
      why - even though it often seems practical - you should definitely 
      ban automatic antialising from your painting habits !!!

          That's also now that you will realize how useful it is to have 
      corrected  a  few  curves  before. You  will  also curse this lame 
      320x200 low resolution ! So I suggest you are careful when chosing 
      your "main" color, in other words you should óALWAYSð  be aware that 
      to "antialize" the edges of your picture  you will need at least 3 
      colors. Then  do  not  hesitate  to  mix  them wildly ! Avoid, big 
      blocks (more than 3 or 4 pixels) and try different  things. Here I 
      guess I can't tell you more  since  each gfxman  has techniques he 
      couldn't even describe !

          To have a closer  view of my  technique refer to the following 
      example :

 colors are :
 
 102  103  213  314  324  435  546  556  657  667

{*i example2.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}


          Sorry if I can't give you any  magical formula  but I'm afraid 
      there isn't any but patience and motivation. 


           ñ4. Well It's Your Turnð óNowð
            ò---------------------------ð

         What else could I say ? Well as you surely noticed the shape of 
      my letters has sometimes be modified between two steps. Surely you 
      will realize that  some details are to be dealt with only when the 
      picture is colored (hey it looks like shit  is my fave saying 8-). 
      the color 1 (remember ?) can be óveryð ñusefulð òin the endð : use it to 
      paint twisted motives. Since  this color  is  very  close  to  the 
      background color it will  only create  a slight change to the full 
      picture but it will also bring  diversity, a little something more 
      to avoid a sad 1 color background 8-)
