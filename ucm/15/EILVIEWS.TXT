Finally the EIL, the event we all have waited for so long, is over. It was 
vanished in a second. Another second in life. Another second in all the lifes of
the approximitely 80 human beeings who attended the party. This article is a
personal roundup of my impressions and of what is left in my memory bank from
the event.

tSCc - After our crusade through the east of germany: "Per Sachsen-Anhalter 
durch die Galaxis" we arrived at the catacombs of doom. :-) Well, one of:the 
first things we did was to raise our big banner (I hoped that could at least 
motivate one of the coders to kick ass again, but I was so wrong). All the rest
of the party the coders only played around with their lame PC's.       ::
Goodbye... and thanx for all the fish!                                 ::

Earx - With his 50% shaved head he looked to me like a TRUE CYBERPUNK coming out
of the dutch underground coding lotek machines. It was a pleasure to meet him
again.                                                                 ::

Havoc - Never talked to him but his picture for the compo was nice (it also won
the competition, although when I personally prefered other pics). Havoc:also 
looked to me like a hooligan in some way :-) No offense mate :-)       ::

Deez - After some smalltalk I recognized that he was wearing a necklace with
the atari:symbol. Cool. He told us that a friend of him made it. The rest of the
vikings,:eh swedes, where a bit strange and some of them always cried:
"walross!" Dunno if they where talking about themselves or what... and they 
didn't even looked like that, they even ate like a walross. For example Baggio 
ordered a:pizza that was as big as a table :-)
        ::
The Creamies - Those happy dudes from Hamburg arrived very late. They left their
home when:we arrived in Dresden. They tried to finish their ST demo but failed.
A.-t- was:rapping around about his 'schlimme Jugend in der DDR'. Funny stuff 
that is :-) I talked a lot with the guys and TAO finished my music demo that
I have released there. Special hellos to you guys!
        ::
Drizzt -:Uh what's that. Drizzt the Rastaman! I missed the Ragga-Music, the
THC-cigarettes and good releases! Inna Dancehall-styleeee!
        ::
Mike - Rumpelkammer rules. I never thought about that! They released some kind
of old-stuff-put-together-demo that really rocks. Congratulations to STAX!
...and MATT said that there will be NO EIL-Demo for sure from STAX... hehehe...
        ::
Energizer:- I really was surprised to find somebody from the old-school 
independent group LAZER at the party. After a long chat with Engergizer he told
me about Wild element, a music-project his is doing together with STAX/LAZER. He
also told:me that they are doing the complete soundtrack for IRON SOLDIER for
the Playstation (produced by Eclipse (who else?)).

Norman - The wild competition brought something really interesting with it. The
Virtual Light Machine by NO/ESCAPE. It's a nice conversion:from the VLM by
Jeff Minter that is included in the Jaguar.              ::
                                                         ::
MSG - HEY! He surely was one of the coolest dudes at the party. Whenever you 
have heard a loud "HEY!" you could be sure it's MSG crying. Also the Poets of
Bombay rocked a lot... another fake demo band OUTED! ;-) ::
                                                         ::
mOd - Ex-groupmate mOd or now mOdmate was still talking about that STUPID
prostitute shit! Anyway it was nice to meet him again.   ::
                                                         ::
moondog - HEY! The other poet of decay brought his PC... what should I say
ehm my name is slim shady, or what!? Anyway the BOMB demo:ruled a lot. 
Unfortunatly this Issue of UCM wasn't finished at the party... 
Egal, wir werden den Planeten in die Knie zwingen!       ::
                                                         ::
UDM - I got hold of a copy of the Undiscovered Mangascene:and I think those
guys are assholes and I nearly quitted the scene coz of such a shit.

So I:end up this little roundup here. Don't forget that this is no party report!
It's:only a personal little view and please don't be angry if you are not
mentioned at all. The party was fucking great and this was only possible by the
fact:that you all attended the event... You all are:
