As I surfed through the net some time ago I was very surprised as I found on the
homepage  of òCUNNING & DEVIOUS GAMESð the  information  that  the full version of
their 3d shooter, called ñ"DESTRUCTION IMMINENT"ð was released for free!
ó"So what? Just leech it!"ð I thought and so I did.

The file  was packed with  the tool ñ"MAKEDISK"ð which is mainly thought for using
games with emulations on PC systems just like ñ"WINSTON"ð or ñ"PACIFIST"ð. Because I
don't had this little thingy I had to surf through the net once more to find and
download it  too, because  I wasn't interested  in leeching a game I  can't play
because I can't depack it.
So my (dumb) PC did  a nice job too in converting the file back to ST format and
there I checked that the  data's on the disk are encoded. So this was the reason
to use ñ"MAKEDISK"ð instead of a normal packer.

Ok. I kicked my PC to  get the  disk back  and switched my STe on... loading the
game. After a  short loading time  the logo of òC&D GAMESð appeared on the screen,
showing up the credits as well. Remembers me to the good old days of selfbooting
ST games... yawn... where are these times?!
Then the  first option  appeared: fastloading or not... I kicked 'yes' and so my
machine loaded  a while and  then nothing more happened. Errr. I WANNA PLAY THIS
GAME, HELL!

So I repeated the whole  procedure, reset, loading, òC&Dð logo, fastloading yes or
not... NOT ofcourse! And guess what? It runs!
After  a while  the title  screen  appeared, showing a  not so good ñ"DESTRUCTION
ñIMMIMENT"ð logo  acompanied  with some  lightspots and a tracker music.  Also the
story of the game is  displayed in this intro and you can  read some stuff about
your plans and goal, escape of a prison and killing monsters.
Sounds  very similar  to the most  3d-shooters at all... just run around, search
some keycards  and  KILL KILL KILL! In fact ñ"D.I."ð is one of the first  3d first
person shooters  on the ST  at all (if I think) which can compared  with all the
popular  games on  Amiga or PC it doesn't matter that there is no  special story
behind the game. Of my knowledge just two other game of  this kind exists on the
ST/e  range of  computers, ñ"SUBSTATION"ð by òUDSñ, released  back in  late 1995 and
ñ"HELLGATE"ð by òSMARTSOFTð, released in early 1998.

Anyway... back to ñ"D.I."ð. After presenting the  story you get informed about all
the enemies waiting in the dungeons of the prison. So you get a picture of every
mad creature and informations about their strenghts and weaknesses and some tips
how to kill them as well. There are the following enemies òknownð...
Robots, Stone  Monsters, Beetles, Gun  Turrets, Giant  Bats, Mutants  and Energy
Lifeforms... The last ones can only killed with plasma guns.
The point òknownð monsters brings a bit more tension  into the game... maybe there
are much more enemies around, no one knows really?!

Furthermore  your objects  and weapons  are listed too... so you can  find stuff
like  medikits, machine guns, rocket  launchers, grenades and plasma guns in the
dungeons, as well as radars to find monsters.

Ok, after you have checked out all the stuff you can enter the game with hitting
space. Now  you get the  possibility to  enter a password for a higher  level or
just to hit return to enter the first stage.
Before starting you get a mission briefing with the thing you have to do now and
short information about the monsters who are awaiting you there.

Ok... now you can press fire... this means "CONTROL" and go...

ñ"D.I."ð is, as  written  above, a  first  person 3d  shooter. So  you're  running
around  in large dungeons, seeing  the whole  area in the view of your hero. The
walls featuring textures this time (in comparison with ñ"SUBSTATION"ð where 'just'
gouraud shading was used to gave the rooms some tridi look.
Ok, the  grafix aren't  very brainblasting, the  colours aren't smashing and the
whole screen  is dominated by grey and brown colours. But remember, it's just an
Atari ST/e  and with just  16 colours it isn't easy to fulfill the screen with a
lot of colours. The  walls and floors  are shaded as well and in the deep of the
the rooms they're lost in darkness. But I have to admit that esp. the shading of
the floor isn't very nice looking.

The sound consists  of several sound tracks for the mission briefings, the level
complete  screens and so  on. In the game itself you can hear just some fx, just
like the screaming of the  monsters, your shot's or a voice which tells you what
item you have picked up.

Besides the 3d window which is about 25o*15o in size you have control bars where
you can see your weapons, ammo, energy, medi-kits and the timelimit.
If you have picked  up the radar it shows you all items and enemies  around. The
different items were displayed with green points and the enemies with red points
(as you too...).
The map shows all the rooms you're checking up, it's some kind of automap and so
the places you already met before getting the map aren't displayed.

The game is very easy  to play. Using the  keyboard is for me still the best way
to play a 3d shooter  at all. The controls are easy to handle, the function keys
activating different weapons or medi-kits or keys.
You must not open the  doors, because they're opening automatically, if they are
not locked ofcourse.

So what? The game  starts really  easy because  the first levels aren't very big
and complicated. At  the beginning there are just "easy" monsters to kill and so
there isn't more to do, just kill and search the exit.
The level of difficulty grows level by level, but without going unfair. Just for
example if  you enter the  third level, the Higher Security Area, which is a bit
more complex you will find radar and mapper as well  who will give you much more
overview about the level and help you to survive it.

At next, the  time limit  isn't very  hard, if I  remember to ñ"SUBSTATION"ð where
in some levels  the limit was a bit too hard, in ñ"D.I."ð it isn't hard at all and
you can explore the levels without going out of time too fast.

Furthermore the monsters, at least the ones I met, were very easy to kill, maybe
to easy. In the first 5 levels just the Robots and gun Turrets are able to shot,
but they are  not very fast in  checking up from where you're shooting  them and
because they don't  have too much hitpoints  at all they're  killed after two or
three shots.
The  Giant Bats  are dying  after just one hit... The  hardest  monsters  at the
beginning  are the Stone Monsters  and the Mutants. Even if they're dying  after
three or four  hits, they're causing a lot of damage (every hit 1o%!) and so you
should avoid to get in touch with them, esp. with more than just one.
A big help for you is the small intelligence of ALL monsters (at least  the ones
I met so far). So if  you're standing  behind a  corner, they're stoping on  the
corner, without  making a step  to the side to go on. So there is no problem for
you to kill them.

And to  show you how easy the game is: I played up to the 5th level with the 1st
try. So  after all the game  should be not too hard  at all, even for people who
don't have any experience in 3d shooters  at all. If you're carefully you should
be able to finish the  game with one try, because  there is only one monster (at
least of the known?!) which seems to be hard to kill, the Energy Lifeforms. They
can just be killed with the plasma gun, draining your energy while touching them
and they can  move through walls! So this is a special monster, of a kind I even
haven't checked out on the 3d shooters I played on my PC in former times.

Anyway, before I come to my conclusion here are some hints for the first levels,
giving you information about the things you have to do and the monsters you will
meet there... not to forget the passwords too.

Mission o1: - Escape from your cell and find the elevator to leave this zone.
            - Enemies: Beetles and Robots
            - Password: none

Mission o2: - In this level are the barracks of the Stone Monsters  located, who
              are protected by Gun Turrets.
            - Enemies: Stone Monsters and Gun Turrets
            - Password: BARRACKS

Mission o3: - Higher Security Area with locked doors - so you have to search for
              keys as well as just killing monsters.
            - Enemies: Beetles, Gun Turrets and Robots
            - Password: SECURITY

Mission o4: - Try to escape through the ventilation system.
            - Enemies: Beetles, Bats and Robots
            - Password: COOLING

Mission o5: - Next level is the Mutant Enclosure...
            - Enemies: Mutants, Gun Turrets, Bats and... dunno, was killed.
            - Password: EXPERIMENT

Ok... hope it will help you to jump over the too easy levels.
Let's go on with the...

óCONCLUSION:ð ñ"D.I."ð is without any doubt a nice  game, presenting  some very rare
            technics on  the ST/e, but with the problem that the capabilities on
            the ST/e are  used at all. It's  a texture mapped 3d shooter and the
            first with textures at all, if you don't count games like ñ"LEGEND OF
            ñVALOUR"ð which isn't a shooter at all. ñ"D.I."ð is at least as fast on
            a simple  ST as ñ"SUBSTATION"ð and this saves the fun to play the game
            because no one is interested in playing a slooow shooter.
            The grafix  of the  game are  a bit  simple, the  animations of  the
            monsters not the best, the textures boring with the time.
            The sounds in the intro and break screens aren't bad at all and they
            are matching to the game a bit too.
            The controls  are easy, even if  it sucks some times if you're stand
            in front of a door but can't  go through  because you have to make a
            small step of 2 pixels to the side... ehh.
            Another good feature, which saves  the motivation, are the passwords
            and ofcourse the point that the game isn't to tough at the beginning
            and the first levels at all... For crack's it is too easy...
            Final words: a ònice gameð! Good to see it free released now!
