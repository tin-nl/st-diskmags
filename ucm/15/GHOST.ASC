          When you read this  title you start  thinking about it : where 
      have I seen this name ??? Actually you can have at least 3 reasons 
      to know it and that's what  we are going to  discuss today. I want 
      to add that I'm  not a  specialist, just a fan and if this article 
      captures your curiosity and makes you want to learn more about one 
      the greatest manga story ever  then I guess I would have succeeded 
      in my task !


          ñ1. The Mangað
          ñ------------ð

          I won't be able to tell you  much about it since I  have never 
      read it myself 8-( It was painted by  Masamune Shirow who was also 
      responsible for the famous * APPLESEED * series initiated in 1985. 
      One can also note that he  was of the rare Japanese mangas authors 
      who managed - just  like Katuhiro  Otomo, creator of the worldwide 
      popular * óAKIRAð * manga - to become renowned beyond  the limits of 
      Japan !!

          The  style  of  the manga  is very  close to  Appleseed in the 
      graphical design but it  is more deeply impregnated with Cyberpunk 
      culture (remember Bladerunner ?) and mixes 'real' and 'artificial' 
      human beings in  intricate stories. Of  course you will find a lot 
      of mechas (ie robots) but the whole story is a lot more than about 
      gang wars or titanic fights  between them. It is (mainly ??) about 
      consciousness, in other words can a humanoid machine be considered 
      as 'human' when it  starts  thinking like  one ? But here stops my 
      exploration  of the manga since I'm not a professional, as I first 
      told you.

          A  last  word  to  inform  you  that  * Ghost In The Shell 2 * 
      started publishing in 1995 right when  the movie - let's say Anime 
      to use the correct term - came out in Japan.


          ò2. The Animeð
          ò------------ð

          This is actually  when I got to  be interested in  this story. 
      For years I have felt attracted to high  quality Animes and when I 
      saw the first pictures of * Ghost In The Shell * and heard that it 
      would be out on the big  screens soon  I didn't  hesitate long ! I 
      know some of you are already  mistaking Animes with Dragon Ball or 
      kids stuff like that. But if you  like real animation you'd better 
      take a closer look at some  master pieces such  as * Porco Rosso * 
      or * Akira *. It  is no  fucking  dollar  making Disney  raytraced 
      blockbuster ! These  movies  deserve  much more than  being simply 
      labelled "manga convertion for dumb kids".

          The movie is  said to be a  little * òtooð * different  from the 
      original story and I  can agree with that at  least on a graphical 
      point of view : here there are no  faces with 2 dots as a nose but 
      detailed  characters and  respected human  proportions (if you see 
      what I mean 8-). Also  like many Animes  Ghost profits by a lot of 
      cinematographic  techniques  such as  parallaxes, blurring effects 
      and many more I just  can't  name. It makes  of Ghost a real movie 
      that's worth seeing for both its story and technical features.

          The story is really  complicated  but I'm trying to give you a 
      comprehensive  summary : in a futuristic  Japan, AI (understand it 
      as Artificial Intelligence) has  become as common as  getting your 
      PC crash when you start Winshit. People bear chips in their brains 
      or artificial legs and so on... We  are at the Police Department : 
      section 9 is trying to work  without having to face section 6, the 
      one is dealing with terrorism while the  other is more "diplomacy" 
      oriented. But  of course, one  day  they  run  into  each  other's 
      business. Rapidly section 6 is going to find out that the computer 
      terrorist they're  tracking  down is  nothing more  but a "failed" 
      experiment  of Section 9 (I may be confusing both sections. Try to 
      forgive me for that but I'm too lazy to  watch the movie again and 
      take  notes for  this  article 8-(. First  due to  be a mere smart
      virus, the * Puppet Master * (so is the name  of this project) has 
      developped his own 'shell' (undestand 'soul') and now he's willing 
      to escape his creators and get a real life. This is a really basic 
      summary  but  believe me, telling  you the  full story  would have 
      uselessly tortured your mind, don't doubt it !!

          The Anime  quality is really  amazing, maybe superior to Akira 
      if I dared say that. Fans of  animated movies  surely know that in 
      this field no one can teach the Japanese creators a lesson !!! The 
      animation, colors and original ideas  added to a complex storyline 
      make of  this  Anime one  of the  best, maybe * óTHE BESTð *, I have 
      ever seen. Also the music that combines  tekno rythms and Japanese 
      classic instruments is absolutely marvellous !! And when you reach 
      the end  after about 70  minutes you'll  need a little time to get 
      back to reality (and you'll  need something  for your headache too 
      8-).

          ó3. The Gameð
          ó-----------ð

          Once you've seen the movie you just want one thing : be a part 
      of it ! It's possible  thanks to  the  Playstation game : Ghost In 
      The Shell. The game is said to be closer to the manga that was the 
      Anime and for sure you  get the same  type of  gfx  in the various 
      sequences of the game. It all starts with  a superb animated movie 
      that shows you 2 mechanical spiders trying to destroy one another. 
      Soon you realize that they're both  manipulated from VR helmets... 
      The music is heavy tekno and it sounds damm good ! 

          In  the game you  are * Fuchikoma *, one  of these intelligent 
      spiders. Even though it's a robot it also has its own thoughts and 
      you won't be surprised when you see it talk to human beings in the 
      animated sequences 8-)

          The game is composed of 10 levels of training and 12 missions. 
      Too bad you don't HAVE TO start with the training because once you 
      start the game you  forget about these 10 levels and then the game 
      seems a little short. Anyway  you will  be given  various missions 
      but most  of  the  time your  objective  will be  quite the same : 
      destroy various targets. You can  pick  up smart bombs  and energy 
      packs. So far we've seen that  a hundred times  before but... your 
      nice red spider  enjoys the ability to walk  upside down, in other 
      words indifferently on the floor, the  ceiling or the walls and it 
      makes one  hell of a  difference ! Sometimes  you will even wonder 
      where you are until you catch a glance of the sky... beneath !

          The playability is perfect, you can  walk, run, slide left and 
      right, jump all the needed moves are  here. The levels  are neatly 
      constructed : there is  a town, the  sewers, the  highway, a tower 
      under  construction... You enjoy an almost complete  freedom to go 
      anywhere. There is a nice animated sequence  between most missions 
      and often a boss is awaiting you at the end of the same missions !
      Even though I've told you it was mainly about shooting you'll have 
      to be a little more clever than a Quake2 freak : some ennemies are 
      invisible (stealth camouflage like in the movie) and some passages 
      are very tricky with mines or detonators.

          All in one, the game is  * ñreallyð *  captivating !!! Its major 
      positive point, besides being adapted from the manga of course, is 
      this possibility to walk almost on any surface ! It will sometimes 
      drive you crazy (where is  that bastard  shooting me from ???) and 
      the missions are  quite original, they include  chase sequences on 
      the water or the highway. The 3 dimensional universe is rather big 
      and very realistic ! 

          And you must not forget  the great  musics  composed by "real" 
      bands such  as Westbam, Dave  Angel, Scan  X and many  others. But 
      read about them a little farther.

          Once you have finished the game you just have one regret : why 
      didn't the creators force us to start with the training ?? You can 
      pratice now if you want  but shooting fake targets isn't the same, 
      is it ?

  
          ñ4. The Soundtrackð
          ñ-----------------ð

          As I  briefly  mentioned it, the  game  benefits  from a  real 
      soundtrack like the unbeatable WipEout episodes. Of course in this 
      cyberpunk setting it couldn't  have been  lousy country music (and 
      fortunately  because country sucks) but it is also a nice surprise 
      to enjoy such tekno tracks, I mean not like some  fake tunes heard 
      in some other games... This is * real * tekno and it also combines 
      Japanese instruments or inspiration ! It really fits  the game and 
      the Anime, so fans will undoubtly enjoy them !

          Of course, as many PSX gamers have observed over the years, it 
      is now impossible to read the musics from your cd player ! Fucking 
      business. I eventually  found the  musics of the  game (though I'm 
      still looking for the Anime  soundtrack. If any of you has it then 
      do  not  hesitate to  contact  me !!!!). Unsurprisingly this cd is 
      pubished by Sony (business is good for u lamers !) and it features

      about 30cmx30 large and makes a nice and colorful poster !

          That's it. Here is  about all I know  of Ghost  In The Shell ! 
      Maybe you don't care or maybe it starts tickling your imagination. 
      I don't know. Anyway I hope you have enjoyed this long informative 
      text about it. See you next time then...
