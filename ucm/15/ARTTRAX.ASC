          This is a small sound disk released last year by a French band 
      called Queen Meka. I can't tell you  much more  about them. I know 
      they are an  association of ST users and that they  wrote a couple 
      of articles for previous issues of * ToXic Mag * but that's all. I 
      can't even remember who the hell sent me this disk ??

          Anyway this is their first music compil named * Elysium *. The 
      short intro is very poor since it is  composed of a violet line at 
      the top of the screen on which letters slide from the right. There 
      is a 1 plan gothic font and letters are painted yellow or green... 
      After a  very  short text a 'See  you soon' tells  you that  it is 
      already over. The soundtrack here is maybe the most interesting of
      the compil but anyway it's time to oress space...

          Hum the GEM : what's next ? Oszi player ???? Hum reminds me of 
      tSCc's Mods  Compils ! But there is  absolutely * no * textfile on 
      the disk and nowhere the  name  of tSCc is mentioned ! I  hope our 
      German fellows have been asked for this before... I doubt it...

          Ok you all know  this  player : as  usual  it features volume 
     control as well as true 50Khz sound and so on. The compil contains 
     five mods, yes it's not  much and  they are : Devil Dream, Koland, 
     Papillon, Director and Shiptrack (very original). Devil  Dream and 
     Shiptrack (you have surely guessed the  nature of the music by its 
     title) are rather slow and quiet  while the others are more in the 
     mood of the tekno wave. All  in all  they are  not bad, that's for 
     sure but they're * not exceptional * either ! I mean I surely keep 
     this stuff on my harddrive but I wouldn't waste a disk for it.


          ñBottom Line :ð
           -------------

          It all sounds like something you've already heard before ! The 
      intro is very basic (but I  can understand that if it was coded by 
      a musician) and the whole thing isn't  really unforgettable. There 
      is  still a little something that makes me uneasy : it is to think 
      that  these  guys  have  used tSCc's  player  without asking  them 
      before. It is not my business but I don't like it anyway. Get this 
      compil if you collect them, otherwise  maybe you  should  wait for 
      next volume, in the hope it is better.
