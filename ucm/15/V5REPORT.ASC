
{*f1VOLCANIC 5 PARTY REPORT{*f0


          So that's  it,  the  fifth (yes  already !!!!) edition  of the 
      Volcanic party is over and it's time to draw conclusions. As usual 
      the party was  organized by  Mentasm  a French  PC band and it was 
      held near Clermont-Ferrand (in France) from 19th to 21th February. 
      But this year  I was  really  disappointed by the  CP and only the 
      presence of Atarian fellows made me not  regret coming there. Like 
      the previous year Mentasm * didn't even * try to entertain us with 
      a cinematic sequence or demo... Not a good sign.


          ñDAY ONEğ   
          ñ-------ğ

          Throughout these three days I will  try to give  you a precise 
      description of  what  appeared  to  be  quite a  poor  and  boring 
      Convention  8-( First, although the organizers expected  about 450 
      people at the end we were  more than  800 !! You can  easily guess 
      that it implied fights for free space, fucking loud noises and the 
      heat was quite incredible (especially when you remember that we're 
      in February, not in August). About 90% of the people there were PC 
      lamers, there were few  guys on  Amiga  machines and the  rest was 
      composed of hardcore Atarians such as :

          òTyphooNğ : The Beast, Telsud and Ptif.   
          óSupremacyğ : Razaac and FirST   
          ñSector Oneğ : Edo, Exyl, Dma Sc, Hello and St Ghost   
          òPopsy Teamğ : BouB, G-Hell, Death and Fabiouno   
          óDizzidenceğ : Cyber Franck (yes a newcomer !!)   
          ñLOud!ğ : me (St SurvivOr)

          And also a few "nostalgic" users who discovered that amazingly 
      the ST wasn't dead yet 8-) Good  news  for us ! We also  met Zappy 
      and Patapom and btw  Zappy told me  that he * DIDN'T * plan any ST 
      release. He laughed and told me that actually his  ST was sleeping 
      somewhere in his room so you know what it means...


          Among the planned releases, the only  production available was 
      òThe Kineton demoğ  by  Ptif and  due to "hardware  difficulties" it 
      wasn't even presented to  any compo (remember  that last year they 
      filmed the demo because it was impossible to connect the St to the 
      giant screen 8-(( Pie  Bill  Gates by  Sector One is very close to 
      completion and it  looks god  damm  good ! Let me  remind you that 
      this ST game is a convertion of the small Pc game in which you had 
      to throw  pies at  Bill Gates  face. This  version includes a nice 
      soundtrack on STe/Falcon  and cool chippy  tune - both by Dma Sc - 
      on Stf. It  features  different  game types  and  everything  runs 
      smoothly. 


       Btw check the -->> óThe Kineton reviewğ <<--

          Back to the CP : the  organization was  incredibely lame ! The 
      first day people had to line up - for more than two hours !!! - to 
      get registered and pre-registration didn't make  any difference... 
      Also the announced access to the  Internet was only available from 
      YOUR machine, erm sorry got no modem on my ST 8-((


          Nothing really  special happened  that day except  that it was 
      really overcrowded and we  had to  keep trying  to find more place 
      for the newcomers. Eventually around 10 at night a voice announced 
      that the whole place  couldn't welcome  more ppl, in other words : 
      "phone your friends who planned to come on  Saturday and tell them 
      to stay home" (really they  said so !). We could appreciate two or 
      three DVD movies  such as Armageddon  and Lost In Space. No master 
      pieces but  good enough not to  fall asleep... At 6 a.m. I stopped 
      struggling with my eyes and decided to get a nap under my table (I 
      forgot to mention that there was  no sleeping room...). I woke up, 
      but did I really sleep anyway, at 8... a.m. argh !


          óDAY TWOğ
          ó-------ğ

          Then I tried to spend my time getting news or even oldies from 
      my pals and on  that  point at  least I  was satisfied  esp when I 
      discovered a linked and  harddrive installable  version of  Cannon 
      Fodder. Also I could enjoy a short glance  at various previews and 
      believe me there are  still cool  things to be released on ST ! As 
      usual the Pc lamers kept playing Quake II or Hexxen II or whatever 
      new and fashionable  doomlike. Also they  downloaded giga bytes of 
      cracked games or porn pics  nights and  days... This year the real 
      novelty was  that  * ñalmost everyoneğ *  - including  some Atarians 
      unfortunately - seemed to have a CRrom recorder and kept recording 
      Pcs or PSX Cds, one after  the other up to a  hundred within the 3 
      days ! That was when I started wondering what the hell I was doing 
      there...

          This second day was  maybe * òevenğ * duller than  the first one 
      except that there were no films  anymore. We  could watch a few PC 
      or Amiga demos but  obviously  there was  no room for ST or Falcon 
      demos, too bad ! I had  the chance to meet a cool guy called Cyber 
      Franck who had recently given up his PC to start a new life on ST. 
      He is planning  some releases  but it's far too  early to announce 
      anything... By this time  I had  finished filling  up my harddrive 
      with a few  news  so I  decided to attend  different compos. First 
      came the music  compo : it was  terribly  boring, always  the same 
      tekno beats and we had to  endure more than 20  tunes ! Later that 
      day - or night  should I  say - came  the  gfx  compo. It was more 
      interesting  even  though PC  gfxmen "tend" to  copy  any magazine 
      photo... The intro and  demo  compos came much  later in the night 
      and sometimes  the following morning but I  had already made up my 
      mind : that CP was pure crap !

          So we had but very little entertainment on  that second day. I 
      wrote or  corrected a few  articles for  next ToXic mag but that's 
      all. Sometimes  the  organizers tried  to kill  our ears with very 
      loud music, the connection  to  the  net was  terribly slow and we 
      could enjoy a few Window$ crashes on the giant  screen. I spent my 
      second  night  trying  to  sleep  with my  head laid  on the table 
      (actually it proved more comfortable that under the table 8-)


          óDAY THREEğ
          ó---------ğ

          With this last day came one single and obsessive thought to my 
      mind : what the hell am I wasting my time here for ?? So I decided 
      to leave early in the  afternoon. The rest  is boring to death : I 
      copied  a  few  games  or old  demos  here  and  there, took a few 
      addresses  and waited for the  end to  come. Finally  they started 
      showing the PC demos  or Wild  productions. There  were a few good 
      things but most of them looked like copy cats !


          ñLast words :ğ  
          ñ------------ğ

          I'm back home after a 5 hour drive in the rain. I have checked 
      my harddrive to  make sure every  program I  copied is  ok and I'm 
      trying to see if I've  forgotten to  mention any  notable event... 
      Erm don't think so. As I told you I was  *ò VERYğ *  disappointed by 
      this CP and I don't even  think it was a real CP : just 800 people 
      gathered  to  play  or copy  games, laming  around (a  few  really 
      worked)  and  a  complete  ignorance  from  the  organizers of the 
      Atarian presence  here. Most  Atarians  were not  really motivated 
      either. Want  a  golden  piece  of advice ? You should have better                                                
      attended the Error In Line party to check what a  real  convention 
      is because the Volcanic 5 was everything ñBUTğ a Coding Party.... As 
      for me this was undoubtly my last Volcanic party !
