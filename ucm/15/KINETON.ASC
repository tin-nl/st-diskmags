          This small demo is the only Atari release of the lame Volcanic 
      5 Party and its creator is  Ptif who brought us a loony  demo last 
      called * ñThe Mart'o demoð *. This  time, again, it is another weird 
      production, nothing stunning but yet pleasant to watch.

          The first screen is a tribute to the 'Mindbomb demo' but oddly 
      instead of a carebear there is a strange creature with the head of 
      Bill Gates ! The glove on  the right of the  screen won't wait for 
      long  before  it  punches  this  lamer  right in  the face while a 
      laughing sample is heard. Next is a ripped  Windows98 presentation 
      and it is  followed by a dot effect that  reads : * PC is Shit ! * 
      Unfortunately there are too few dots displayed and as a result you 
      may not be able to read this  message. Actually I had to watch the 
      demo several times before I realized there was something written !

          Next part  is the  intro  itself : it is  composed of  a funny 
      Typhoon logo by Kyst (hello lazy guy are you still that decided to 
      move your ass ??). It is followed  by a Flip'o-like "presents" and 
      a nice  rendered  logo which  gives us the  name of the demo : the 
      Kineton. And btw, no, it doesn't mean  * anything * in French 8-). 
      A cool effect comes next : classic  psyche  circles  mix with each 
      other inside an Atari logo shape.

          The following effect is very old looking : a red A letter (for 
      Apprentice this is the sticker you have to put on your car's trunk 
      when you're a rookie in France) distorts horizontally and bounces. 
      Quite lame. Next guest is a  nuts looking duck swimming on a sinus 
      waved  sea. As it  reaches the  left border, its  head strikes the 
      edge, separates  from the  body and sinks  while a few bobbles pop 
      up. Very funny actually, kind of delirious thing like the good old 
      Garcimore series ! Last but  not least a 'cow'-box  appears (a box 
      with a cow painted on it), it flips  upside down  while a MEuuuuuh 
      sample is played 8-)

          The final part is  dedicated to  the  credits : using pictures 
      that represent South Park characters, Ptif  introduces the various 
      people involved in  the demo  with some  information about each of 
      them and that's it. Press space  and a  cute teddy  bear will wish 
      you good night. But you can also wait a  while to see the 'cow'box 
      again 8-)

   
          òBottom Lineð : one sure  thing is  that this demo  won't change 
          -----------   the look of the Atari  scene and yet it  is well 
      designed and quite funny, though some parts like  the dots and 'A' 
      distorter are really lame. I would say that you should have a look 
      at it at least once to make up your mind.
