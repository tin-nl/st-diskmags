          Here comes at last the so long awaited sign of life from Cream 
      almost two years after Songs That Make You Go Mmmm 2. To speak the 
      truth I couldn't help having a look at their * ñcoolð * online diary 
      every day (before that fucking Pc crashed !!) trying to figure out 
      when the demo would be out. Finally it's here and  you can rejoice 
      ooooooh yeah !

{*i think3.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

  [sorry but this stunning picture originally uses the extended STe palette ]
 
          Once you've inserted the disk into your ST, a stunning picture 
      by A -t- representing a  man  deeply  plunged in  his  thoughts (I 
      can't find words to tell you how both loader pics are awesome !!!) 
      is displayed along with a cool Tao chip. The demo then starts with 
      a "pre"intro which * òstrangelyð * reminds us of STGMM2. There is  a 
      great CREAM logo by A -t- (who else ?) and some  text is displayed 
      telling us about the lazyness of  the  band (and so on) and  comes 
      along with a nice chipsound  which is actually a remix of STMYGMM2 
      intro, I love the  idea ! But the  real intro starts right after.

          After a short text which tells us that  while some * óretiredð * 
      nostalgic guys keep dreaming about the golden past and some others 
      have  surrendered to  the  shameful  side, there  are still people 
      around who ... do things ! 

          Then comes THE shock ! Really I was struck dumb when I saw the 
      first plasma tunnel !! Ok the resolution must be 160 x 100 and the 
      window is about 320x100 but the result kills every try done before 
      that ! There are a dozen, surely  more, different types of tunnels 
      with distorting effects and nice colors. Well that's what I call a 
      very nice intro and I didn't know Candyman was THAT good !!! Again 
      Tao gives us a new chip and manages to amaze us with weird sounds.

          Press space to view the second  loader pic while the main part 
      is loading : a man seems to be  floating in water (?) and his body 
      is connected (to what ? reality ?) by many ducts. Wonderful !

          The main part is  similar to STMYGMM2 * òin the conceptð * since 
      it offers a dozen of chips by Tao  and gfx by A -t-. But this time 
      you  are going to be  very  surprised ! The  main menu  looks well 
      designed with a list of musics, an equalizer (on the bottom) and a 
      text box on the right. But what is this sound ? Yes all musics are 
      sidvoices and they sound * óreally reallyð * good ! Fans will notice 
      3 or 4 remixes of chips Tao had done for previous issues of UCM... 
      The result is stunning and you will always be surprised by the odd 
      sounds Tao manages  to generate ! Also the graphical part  is very 
      surprising since it is a sort of * comics like * story composed of 
      scanned paintings by A -t-. The scan  quality is  maybe the best I 
      have ever seen, the palette looks really  smooth (but it is an Ste 
      palette yep !). The  story  itself is  pleasant, a sort of utopian 
      vision... Up to you to find the meaning to it 8-)

          Once you're getting bored (after 40 minutes or so 8--) you can 
      press 'reset' to get to the last  part. It also consists of plasma 
      tunnels but they are from another type. They also feature graphics 
      with the names and functions of each member of CREAM. You can also 
      note that the chip was  composed by Candyman and converted by Tao. 
      Again it is really beautiful it sounds like wonder and that's it !


          óBottom Line :ð
          ó-------------ð

          Everything in this demo looks nice, * ñveryð * òveryð * nice ! The 
      overall design is almost perfect (but there is not such a thing as 
      perfection 8-) and the code part is up to the rest : brilliant ! I 
      won't  give  any ratings because I don't like  that, hey maybe you 
      don't like sidvoices or plasma tunnels 8-)))

    
          No doubt you òMUSTð GET THIS DEMO NOW !!!!!!
