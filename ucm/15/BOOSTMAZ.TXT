Yupp, this is a ñfake-demo-christmas-introð. And why not ? So far, those
ñfakeð-production have covered every aspect of the scene, so why not
a ñchristmas-introð as well ?

Instead of being a ñchristmasð-intro or an ñX-masð-intro, it claims
to be an ñXXXð-mas intro.
XXX is more or less a common term for adult-material and therefore
this ñXXXð-mas intro features a very little bit of adult material but
óa lotð of ñXðs.
On screen, you see "Mary", stripped naked with just one òXð over each
of her breasts and an òXð over her crotch.
The top line says "òda b00stersð, the bottom line "óXXX-mas introð".

Mary moves a little, perhaps in 2 frames a second and it probably 
supposed to look like dancing while snow falls behind her.
The snow is not actually falling but is part of the animation that
makes Mary dance.

Oh yes, and some typical fake-demo-christmas music is being played.

So, that's all there basically is.
The gag with the "ñXXXð"-mas intro made me smile, but the joke itself
is ruined by the demo, unfortunately.
Mary looks cheap, but not funny, since she is drawn by hand, the òXð's
do not cover anything you would long to see. The whole screen features
perhaps 4 colours, the snow falling doesn't look like snow falling because
it's hard to tell if it's actually moving up- or downwards ... or to the
left or to the right ... Or not at all ...

Well, as a òfake-christmas-demoð, this was worth a try.
It is not very funny though. I have seen better fake-demos, i have seen
worse fake-demos.
You'll obviously delete it once you saw it, but i guess that's what this
demo has been made for.

An average fake-demo, not very original, but not that bad either.
