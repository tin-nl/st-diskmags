          [works on ST/e 1Mo, Falcon and even Amiga !]                               
          
          Code : ñEvil/DHSð
          Msx  : óDmaSc(la belette)/Sector Oneð
          Gfx  : òVarious 8-)ð                       
 
          A  few months ago  ñEvilð initiated a new  sort of  competition he quite 
naturally named ó'Online  compos'ð. If I  remember well  the first one was a music 
competition restricted to non  musicians 8-) The results are said to have caused 
some casualties around ;-) This time it was a gfx compo with easy rules : within 
a maximum window of ò160x100 using only 4 colors (background included)ð you had to 
do your best ! There were not  less than  ñ13  picturesð entered and believe me it 
was really amazing ! Today, Sunday June 6th, the  results have been released and 
on this occasion Evil has brought us a cool  four color intro  that runs on many 
machines as usual.

          Run the 190 Kb  intro and get  a seat : a  nice chip is  heard while a 
nice DHS logo  is  displayed. Then a 160 x 100 window opens and shows a stunning 
tunnel going forward and backward, twisting and so on ! Yeah, Evil is definitely 
óthe tunnel wizard !ð The tunnel is only 4 colors  but there is a weird flickering 
method used and it looks just ñgreat!ð Time for some info about the results of the 
compo : a 1plan text is displayed  with the name  of the artist, picture and his 
rank. We start from the end  and as we come closer to the great winner I realize 
the variety of pictures that can be done  with only 4 colors ! No great surprise 
as for the winner esp when you know who took part to the compo :) 

          ñAgent -tð comes first with an amazing portrait of himself, hey why 
don't you have a look at it yourself ?

          òHavocð ranks second with a Cameron inspiration : another great talented 
guy who has just popped up from nowhere ! After his success at Error In Line 99 
I hope we can soon see more gfx from him.

          Third is ómOdð, now officially member of ñCheckpointð. Surprisingly mOd   
loses a little prestige in this competition in spite of his superb contribution. 
Well being 3rf is a shame either :)

          Hey look who's coming after ? Yeah it's me òStsurvivor-lamerð ;-) Well I 
used to think that this picture was quite good but of course that was BEFORE I 
saw the other pictures 8-)

          The other pictures aren't bad either, a great picture by ñpAranoidð who 
seems to have progressed  a lot lately !! As for the demo  well you ómustð get it 
as it looks like  ònothing you've seen before !ð The tunnels by Evil are stunning 
and the music very pleasant then enjoy the show !
