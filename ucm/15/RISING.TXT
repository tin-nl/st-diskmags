                                      System     : ñAll Stsð
                                      Code + gfx : òSinnerð
                                      Msx        : óJedið
                                      

          I ñhateð to ówasteð my time and this review is  such a fucking waste but I 
was told it  was to be reviewed and it seems nobody wanted to do  it... Well the 
earlier we start the earlier we're finished !

          This demo could be a fake but this guy òSinnerð seems to be sincere ! It 
makes me laugh not because of the  crappy quality  of this  thing but because of 
the dramatic "ófew demosð are  still released on  ST these days". Erm yeah only ñ13ð 
demos have been released so far (only for the beginning of 99)... the music is a 
very old chip by òJedið  and in some ways  I like it  because it reminds me of the 
first cracked games I played on ST.

          It all starts with a  lame text  that says "welcome to  Hell Atarians" 
and sure this is  hell with its óhellish system  fontð. Next screen must have been 
an attempt to create  gfx, better  skip it. Oh yeah cool a  Mac Donald sign, you 
know the big 'M' but this one stands for Marijuana ;-) The only piece of humour. 
It comes with an ugly horizontal scrolltext at the bottom. More crap...

          There is a kind of starfield but it is ñsooooooo slowð that I'm not sure 
you can call  that  a starfield... the first  one is  vertical and  then it gets 
horizontal. Last screen is a greetings screen with the system  font and some try 
to make ascii  arts but we're  are òlight  yearsð far from some tSCc's examples... 
That's it you can leave the intro now.


          ñBottom Lineð : really it was a torture to review this  because I think 
there is ònothing good in it !ð Sorry Sinner you are   surely a beginner and I am   
the first one to ómotivateð youngsters but you should ñnotð have released this, you  
should have shown it  to your friends. Anyway I hope we  can hear from you soon   
with hopefully better productions.
