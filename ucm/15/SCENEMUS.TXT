ñScene Music Compilationð by òMystic Bytesð (1998) ó[Falcon VGA/RGB]ð

Since òMC Laserð displayed very clearly in ñUndercover issue 14ð that
he doesn't like to review music-compilations anymore - and since he also
donated a tune for this compilation, i thought it would probably be
nice, if a ónon-musicianð like me would review this "demo".

It came with quite some delay, it is about ò4 MBð large - unpacked - and
yet it contains "ñonlyð" 14 tracks from various artists of various groups.
It features its own ñshellð - unlike for example òtsccð's music compilation
disks. It requires a Falcon, but thank goodness, it allows to be executed
either in ñRGBð 60 Hz or in ñVGAð 60 Hz - using a prompt during start-up,
like òDHSð's demos usually do.
In contrast to òDHSð's demos you get a completely filled screen on both
ñVGAð and ñRGBð. And, in contrast to òDHSð's or òCheckpoint/Escapeð's
music compilations, you get no ñdemo-FXð during the replay except for
a óstereo-oscilloscopeð in the upper right corner.
The left half of the screen ñlistsð all the òtracksð, wildly abusing capital
and ordinary letters. The right part of the screen contains the óstereo-
oscilloscopeð, just above a ótime-counterð which displays the time the
current tune is being played and the ónameð and ógroupð of the artist
who made the current track.
Between those 2 parts are 2 arrows which allow to scroll through the
list of tunes, an ear and arrows up and down which enable the viewer
- or listener - to set the volume.
In the lowest line, you find a set of òbuttonsð which work like the buttons
on a CD-player: òstop, last track, rewind, play, fast forward, next track
and pause.ð
The background looks like a weird texture out of Photoshop or even 
worse, a bit like a landscape from bird-view, the back of a dinosaur,
a field of stones under water in various shades of blue and grey ...
The icons look like having been taken pictures of while they move rapidly.

I'll return to the ñshellð later on, let's talk about the ñmusicð, after
all, this is a òmusicð-compilation.

ñAlternative Powerð by òDMA SCð of óSector Oneð
This tune is the first on the list and is being played when starting the
demo. It is typical for òDMA SCð in ñstyle, compositionð and ñspeedð.
It is cheerful, "ñbrightð" and features excellently chosen samples,
so it is also technically very good.
The style is a typical "ñold-schoolð"-mod-style, which is ònotð meant
negative. It is even one of òDMA SCð's best tunes and definetly one of
the highlights of this demo.

ñAphro-letð by òsh3ð of óReservoir Godsð
"ñLet the bass just boomð" ... This sample is being repeated over and
over again in this tune. The style is somewhat hard to characterise, it
comes rather close to òDrum'n Bassð. Besides, there are very little
voices features besides the spoken sample and the drumtrack.
This tune is not directly ñmy pair of shoesð. It lacks melody and
probably inspiration - although this tune is supposed to be like that
i guess. 

ñCamelð by òFuzzkidð of óCollapzeð
ñHardcore-technoð-folks, listen up, this is for you. The style is rather
òroughð, quite quick and features pretty òdarkð samples.
The bass is really low in this one and due to the modplayer's excellent
output in bass & treble, it sounds even rougher.
I personally like this tune very much, although it is a bit short.

ñdistorted illusionsð by òtinkerð of óteenageð
Welcome to Holland. This tune is quite close to ñdutch gabberð. I don't
mean the currently very popular (and very boring and uninspired)
"òRotterdam Terror Corpsð"-gabber, it's rather good old dutch gabber like
òWaxweazleð and òDJ Robð made it.
Unfortunately, the theme of this tune is a bit short which leaves a mixed
impression of this track: It lacks a bit inspiration probably.
Well, turn up your speakers, switch on the rainbow-laser (if you happen
to have one) and dance to this track. It's a good one.

ñempty thoughtsð by òc-frogð of ónatureð.
A rather slow tune, which would be the perfect tune for ñcredits-screensð,
ñepiloguesð and things like that. It is quite harmonic, but features an
excellent change of chords which indeed is the most impressive detail about
this tune. Its style is very consequently kept throughout the whole track,
technically, it is very good as well.
Impressive ...

ñLemonð by òtoodelooð of óDead Hackers Societyð
Gee, what a contrast to òchippin for air 6ð. òToodelooð is neither ñjazzyð
nor ñfunkyð with this tune, it's rather rough indeed.
When i started to like ñhardcore-technoð, everybody was wild about a tune
without a name, which was simply called "guitar-tech". Everyone afterwards
tried to achieve a similar style (like for example The Prodigy), but they
all failed.
Well, òtoodelooð made it. This is - in my eyes - the best tune of this
compilation, it is fast, it is technically superb, the choice of samples
is excellent, the music is set up well and really sounds terrific. It
lacks neither variation nor consequence and is probably one of the best
tunes ever from òtoodelooð - out of the 154672547234 he made so far.

ñOvertangerð by òthomasð by óNew Beat Developmentð
This track starts with a very original and very typical drumtrack - 
typical for òThomasð. Although the rest of this tune is not THAT
typical for òThomasð, the drumpatterns are.
The rest of the music is a bit idyllic and somewhere between harmonic
and disharmonic, neither major nor minor. It is a good tune without a
doubt and although it probably lacks a bit inspiration, i like it though.
Simply ñbecauseð it is between harmonic and disharmonic. ;-)

ñSkydiverð by òMr. Futureð of óParanoiað
Well, i have to be careful here, after all, òMRFð is a member of my group.
But after all, the style of this track is so typical for òMRFð, that there
is very little to do wrong when describing this tune.
It is quite fast, features a rather aggressive start but gets less
aggressive in the middle of the track. The choice of samples is sensible
and although it is not directly hardcore-techno, it clings to my definition
of ótechnoð very well. Remarkable use of the bassdrum, typical for òMRFð.
A good tune and since i like his style, it is my favourite one in this
compilation.

ñTelkkarið by òperkeleð of óindð.
A bit short probably ... But once again òperkeleð proves his flexibility
and his originality within this tune. The drumtrack is laid out well,
the bassline fits perfectly into this ... The tune is just a bit too 
short and unfortunately lacks a bit of inspiration - not too say
variation, which is of course because of its rather modest length.
I'd say, give us more of that òperkeleð ... Probably in the next scene
music compilation ?

ñte-X-mas 9xð by òeXTenDð of óMystic Bytesð
ñTe-X-masð was the name of the music used in the incredible òtime outð
demo by óMystic Bytesð - and one of the weirdest and best tunes i have
ever heard. ñTe-X-Mas 9xð is again a tune which has written òxtdð all
over it - i can hardly think of another ñAtari-scene-trackerð who would
come up with a tune like this.
Well, it is losely based on the original òte-X-masð, it is just a bit
more twisted. It doesn't have something one could call melody, but again,
this doesn't matter. It is really cool, but impossible to describe.
At least that is ñoneð tune that doesn't follow òanyð rules of a classical
mod i like though.

ñtwilite sleepð by òMC Laserð of ótSCcð
Wait a second ... Is this really an òMC Laserð tune ? It is hardly
experimental ;-).
Okay, this is a really óidyllicð tune. It is filled with harmony and
sounds so peaceful and relaxing, it is so ñbeautifulð ... The choice
of samples as well as the usage of chords is superb. Although it also
lacks a bit melody, it is the best tune i have heard from òMC Laserð so
far. Give it a spin if you like ñrelaxingð tunes.

ñWarlockð by òeXTenDð of óMystic Bytesð
Hard to believe, but for a mod by òxtdð, this is a rather ñclassicð
tune - in style.
Well, it is very dark and could be put next to "òLeatherstipð and
òNitzer Ebbð" CDs - if you have any.
And this already describes the tune as far as possible. It probably
lacks melody, but let's face it, "ñmelodyð wasn't exactly the strong
point of òxtdð's other tunes. ;-)
The usage of spoken samples however make this one special though.
I think people who like the groups mentioned above will like it a lot,
but it doesn't come anywhere near ñte-X-mas 9xð in my eyes.

ñWeð by ò505ð of óCheckpointð
ò505ð has happily donated a track for this compilation as well.
For ò505ð, this is a rather happy tune. The choice of instruments,
the usage of chords, this tune is technically perfect - like most
of ò505ð's tunes are. Nevertheless, the music could do with a bit
more inspiration and variation - it is a rather simple tune.
But hey, why not ? Does every tune donated for this compilation have
to be a symphony of ideas, effects and innovative melodies ?
I guess not. This tune is cute, a bit too short, but cute.
Just like ò505ð ... ;-)

ñWho is Satoshið by òMSGð of óReservoir Godsð
òMSGð is always good for a surprise, isn't he ? Well, this tune is.
It is very dark, it features very low and gloomy samples, the
bassline is "muddy" and even the main voice is rather low but -
guess what - the music is rather harmonic and "ñhappyð", despite
the low and usage of tones.
The choice of samples is not the best though, the samples sound
a bit out of key sometimes and they seem to have been taken from
òMSGð's excellent Super Mario Bros. remix - which was a completely
different style after all.
Still, it is a "ñdarkð" track with a twist, the lowest and gloomiest
happy tune i have ever heard.

òEpilogueð
So, ñ4 MBð of scene-music and what have we got here ?
The musics - as mentioned above - reflect the styles of their authors
very well, and this is what a "scene-music compilation" should do,
shouldn't it ?
The highlights of this compilation are - in my eyes - òMr.Futureð's
ñSkydiverð and òtoodelooð's ñLemonð, but of course only because they
match my favourite kind of music.
But, all the entries are good in their own special way, although
most of the tunes could either have been a bit longer or feature a bit
more variation - but what the hell, they are all special and unique.
I am a bit dissappointed about the shell. Although it looks good
and works well, it seems to have been written in a hurry - despite
the delay. Scrolling up- and downwards through the list of modules
just replaces the names of the tracks in the rectangle they are
written in in a very flashy way - you can see the refresh of the
boxes while scrolling. Moving the mousepointer over the oscilloscope
leaves marks from time to time on the background.
The time-counter doesn't follow the fast-forward or rewind and there-
fore doesn't do what a time-counter is supposed to do as far as i
can see it -  it just counts the time how long the current track
has been "active", no matter how ofter you rewind or fast-forward
it. There is no intro and besides the way the title-screen and the menu
are being brought upon the screen, there are no effects at all, 
neither visual nor aural.
Well, of course you cannot expect any effects in a music-compilation
although it would have been nice to have some.
The shell does its job and looks good, which is its main task and
can therefore be judged "absolutely suitable" although a bit more
work around the details like the scrolling of the names or the
time-counter would have paid in my eyes.

I wouldn't want to rate the music-compilation in points, it is
unique and very special as it only features musicians, that still
actively support the Atari scene and even work using Ataris most
of the time - hence there is no way to compare it.
Mystic Bytes wrapped the tunes all up in a nice package with a good
looking shell which is basic, but functional.
A must have for people who like lots of styles packed together in
one compilation, a nice thing to have for people who like their Falcon
to demonstrate its powers in sounding good, a good compilation for
people who want to have a "guide" to what style is connected to which
musician, but a bad compilation for people with small harddisks. ;-)

Give us more like this in the future, Mystic Bytes ...
