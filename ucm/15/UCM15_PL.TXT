                           - no rumours. just facts. -  
   
     Recently we were  witness to the  small resurrection  of the polish  atari 
scene. Some crews  already counted as DEAD  were back  on the  Atari  scene and 
promised to kick some ass again! =) While I am here I would like to explain one 
thing: 
 
When I edit each issue of the polish scene report I always take the information 
>> DIRECTLY << from the memebers from each group.  Unfortunately sometimes they 
don't keep their promises or just change their mind. That's not my fault! 
I will give you an example:

Klocek/Syntax called me  on the phone  and told  me that  Syntax was  dead, and 
there was no chance of any resurrection in the future.  He was completly broken 
down and he didn't know "what had happend" to yoyo. Our chat looked like this:

klocek:  hi grey, I have some bad news for you...
  grey:  what happend?!
klocek:  syntax is DEAD.
  grey:  is this a joke?!?!?
klocek:  nope, I am not kidding. I am completly broken...
  grey:  wassup with Yoyo?!
klocek:  i have no idea... i visited him today and he told he won't continue 
         his work on the st... 
  grey:  does it mean that Syntax doesn't exists anymore?!
klocek:  definitely... Syntax is DEAD. 
  grey:  is there any chance of seeing your new promised demo?
klocek:  nope. Yoyo doesn't care about coding on ST anymore. Dunno why...
  grey:  did you talk to him?
klocek:  sure i did, but he didn't tell me the reason for his move...
  grey:  what are you going to do now? will you hold the Syntax label?
klocek:  nope, i decided to create a new crew, "Underground", together with 
         my friend called Black Death... You can put it down in the new issue
         of UnderCover... "Syntax is DEAD", "UNDEGROUND arrive".
  grey:  okay... sad to here that... in the previous issue I already wrote  
         about your new forthcoming demo... 
klocek:  i know, sorry grey... it's not my fault...
 
And now,  over two months  after that  I hear  Syntax is still  alive 'coz Yoyo 
decided to continue  his work.  Of course I  was very happy  to hear  that, but 
these situations can give the impression  that I'm a bad reporter or something.

I can't really foresee everything. If a member of X group calls me and tells me 
his "group is dead" and "there is no chance for ANY ressurection"  then I write 
it down.  I'm  not  listening  to rumours,  I always  CHECK >> EACH << piece of 
information.    
    
With this issue of polish scene report  I've  decided  to put a date and source
on each piece  of information  I got.  I can't take >> ANY << resposibility for 
the things I hear...

{*f1COBRA (ST/FALCON){*f0


old snakes back home..

Erm,  another explanation is needed here.  In one of the previous issues of UCM 
you can read that  "Cobra"  is dead 'coz almost all the CODERS left the crew to 
create the Atari-section of "Whelpz".  Yup,  that was absolutely true.  Someone
member of "Whelpz" was making some silly jokes at the latest QuaST party asking 
Winio (a swapper) "if Cobra will take part in  the demo competition".  That was
damn ironic of course when you notice that only two swappers and one gfx artist
were left in "Cobra".  And guess what?  After 4 months  Winio  called me on the 
phone  and said  "he'd  released a  Last Party  Falcon  invitro!" Another shock 
arrived- one month later Winio released their 1st multi-part Falcon demo called 
"Generation Gap"!  Who would expect that?! NOONE.  Winio gave us a big surprise 
and finally cut those very ironic smiles of ex Cobra members =))  
Clever beast, eh? 8-))

My best congrats to Winio! Keep it up, dude! 

Recently  Mayonez  (a very talented ST coder) left  Whelpz  to join  Cobra once 
again!  He is busy working on the  ST demo  at Error In Line '99 - be ready for
a real treat!

UPDATE:   as you would guess, this demo wasn't finished in time :(( anyway guys
          from Cobra decided to show it to the EIL posse.  the date-release  is 
          unknown atm. the demo will be called "awaken". 

Winio has begun his work on the 2nd multi-part demo for the Falcon. If all goes
to plan we >> SHOULD << see his contribution at the  Error In Line '99 as well! 
But it's not 100% certain, so don't count on it too much. 

UPDATE:   "Revertant", the latest Falcon demo from Cobra took  the 3rd place at 
          EIL'99.  Winio managed to put all effects together and show it to the
          party-posse. The final release has been spreaded after 2 months.  
          Check it out!

{*f1KAID/IND. (ST/F030){*f0

failed PRESTIGE..

Kaid (known before as  Adamsky) decided to split from  Prestige  because of (as
he told) "total inactivity of the 2nd member - Vulgar". I met Kaid on IRC today 
and this is what he said:

"...i am so tired asking Vulgar for anything. he always complains about the 
 lack of time, i am sick of it... he just doesn't hold any promises. in that 
 case i will continue work on the echo magazine and other projects myself...".  

So  Kaid  isn't going to leave  the Atari scene  and he'll  continue to work on 
the projects himself! 

Recently  he is  busy working on a  new game  called "Motocross 2D". It will be 
a very easy game,  something  like  "Tron"  (top view, lines on the screen) but 
much more enlarged. It will contain the following options:

- one race/championship  
- 2 levels        
- 20 race-courses

"Motocross 2D"  will  work on  ST/Falcon  and -should be- released  during  the
summer holidays.

If all goes to plan Winio/COBRA will code a new Falcon shell for Echo magazine. 
BTW - Kaid has no motivation to make Echo magazine for the ST machines anymore. 
But who knows?  Polish sceners like to change their mind so fast! (e.g. Syntax) 
Kaid is looking for ANY contributors,  so if you would like to help him out use 
the following e-mail addy:

                         adamsky@box43.gnet.pl
                         adamsky@gdynia.multinet.pl

Kaid is also going to release an "editor" for his own game "Bitwa Morska"...

{*f1MYSTIC BYTES (ST/FALCON){*f0

going inactive?!

Nope! No worries.  We know there is a lack of  new releases  from us this year,
but  we've  decided to change our minds. We won't make the 2nd "Teardrop" which
was critized for  the ugly  textures  and old-fashioned msx.  We are working on 
every DETAIL of the new demo...  We can't give you any precise date-release atm
but you should see it before the end of August. 

If all goes to plan  you should see  a new msx colly for the falcy  in the near
future.  It  won't be  a 2nd volume of  SMC  but an absolutely !NEW! collection 
featuring modules by... hmmm, no, i won't tell you now :-))  

Our long awaited "Breath" demo for ST has been -finnaly- released!  It took the
2nd place at eaSTer Atari convention - EIL'99.  

Recently we are busy working on three projects:

- upside down (multi-part demo for the Falcon)  
- operacja proboszcz (game for the Falcon) 
- st joketro =))

....stay tuned!

{*f1NO FUTURE (FALCON){*f0

excellent team has no future?

The chaps  from  Excellent Team  have  decided to change  their  group-name  to 
No Future. Why? This is what I've heard from Bloomer: 

"...the name was too boring, dull and a little bit idiotic...", "...No Future 
 isn't too much of a scene-related team now...".

Anyway Bloomer will TRY to finish his msx colly for the  Falcon  until  EIL'99.
But >> NO PROMISES <<.  

Well, as i said NO PROMISES. I am writing these words 2 months after the EIL'99 
and i didn't get any life-sign from Bloomer up to now. I've heard that this msx 
colly -is- released from a long time (I mean about the technical-side) but some
modules were still missing. Oh well...

the voice from grave!

Yup, guys!  Be carefull 'coz those nasty guys are going to terrorise your souls
again! Darth (a main master of black ceremonies) is back on the scene! Suddenly 
after a year of total silence and killing animals in the forest Darth announced 
he is "back on track".    
 
here is a part of our "phone-chat":

 grey:  are you coming to back to the scene?
darth:  yup. in fact i never left... my falcon broke down, not my fault.
 grey:  does that mean we can expect some new releases from you?
darth:  sure, as soon as somebody will repair my falcon I promise to continue 
        my scene-work!  
 grey:  okay, I will do my best to help you out...
 grey:  what's the current member status of Pandemonium?
darth:  well, I have to re-build PNM completly now...  
 grey:  okay, hope to see ya back soon!
darth:  you sure will. i am curious to see the latest releases. i haven't 
        seen anything for a year or so...

okay, that's it guys. more news will follow!

take care about your souls!

{*f1SYNTAX (ST){*f0

yoyo's resurrection!?

Yahoo! The most famous  ST coder  of the  latest decade  has announced he is to 
release new stuff under the 'Syntax' label!  Yup, I couldn't believe my (always 
clean..) ears either.  I called  Klocek  to ask him for some more COMPLETE info 
about their "reanimation" and few days later  I got a mail with  all the expla-
nations.
 
Klocek written:

"...for a school's time  Yoyo decided to abandon coding but he will back to the 
 ST keyboard in the near future.  Our next demo will be probably called "Killer
 demo 2000" and should see a light of the day in the summer holidays. This time 
 be ready for absolutely  mega-kick!  There is also a  little chance  that Yoyo 
 will code a small intro for the 1st issue of Underground disk magazine..."
 (about the magazine read below!)       

date: 05.03.99;   source: klocek/syntax^underground
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1UNDERGROUND 99 (ST){*f0

syntax underground?!

When  Klocek  heard about  the  yoyo's  lack of motivation  to continue work on 
the STs he decided to create a new team.  As you will have read  above it was a 
"while split up" but  Klocek  decided to keep that group anyway. Underground 99
was mainly created to make a disk-magazine, just called  "Underground".  In the
forthcoming issue  you  SHOULD  find a bunch of news and reviews about releases
for all atari machines (xl/st/falcon/jag). Klocek announces it will be the best 
polish disk-magazine about the scene and should also beat UCM :-)) 

Underground 99 consists the following members: 

- klocek (gfx artist, gfa code)
- eros (txt writer)
- l.c. (coder, txt writer)
- black death (txt writer)

In the future they plan to release intros/demos as well.
  
The 1st issue of "Underground" disk-zine should be released in June.
    
It will feature:

- new and fast shell (mouse control)
- txt displayed in med-res/2 col. 
- SID tunes  
- articles mainly scene-related
- screenshots and photos in 256 colours on the simple ST
- english articles
- intro coded by Yoyo or L.C. 
- competition sponsored by Gustaw/Jaguar Club 
  (full version of Power Up)

Klocek's own magazine called  "Player"  won't see another issue, however Klocek
decided to put a "Player corner" in the "Underground". You will find reviews of
ST/Falcon and Jaguar games there...

{*f1PARTY NEWS!!{*f0

This year we have at least 3 (yup!) atari-only parties in Poland! Unfortunately 
I don't have any precise info yet. Here's what I've heard up to now:


ñSTESZEWO '99 (2nd edition)ð

Organizers are people involved with  the biggest "discussion-atari-list" on the 
Internet, simply called "AtariPL". Steszowo is a name of the little town around
Poznan. It won't be a real demo-party but  a little Atari event to exchange new 
software etc... 

/ When? /

24th-25th July, 1999.

You'll find some info about this event at the following URL address:

http://www.atari.org.pl/

BEWARE - it's in polish ;-)))


òOPALENICA '99 (3rd edition)ð

Recent  info  about this party  is rare,  I wasn't  able  to find  any official 
invitation. The one thing REALLY for sure - this party WILL become a reality :) 
Parties in  Opalenica  were mainly organized during the winter (e.g. Last Party 
on December'98) but due to the fact there won't be another QuaST edition in the 
summer, Opalenica will take place on June; just to save the tradition of polish 
atari-summer parties!

/ When? /

9th-11th July, 1999.

Who is going there?

As far as I know - chaps from Cobra, Underground and Mystic Bytes.


óOPALENICA '99 (4rd edition)ð

Hey, WTH are you talking about?! 2nd party in Opalenica? Yep! There will be two 
(yup!) parties in that city this year =)) The 2nd one (probably called the Last 
Party'99) will take place in December, but it's still uncertain when exactly. 


If you would like to get more  news about  these parties  just write me a note. 
More details should follow soon...
