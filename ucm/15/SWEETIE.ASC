       ~ When Talented Guys Meet iT Can ONly End Up With a GreAT dEMo ! ~    

          This is my first review  of a St  demo released  at that great 
      party called  ñError In  Lineð that was held in Dresden last  April. 
      This demo came 4th in the compo, right after  STAX demo (dunno why 
      because Stax  demo isn't  that great) but  honestly the quality of 
      all demos shown  there  was óreally high !!!ð Please take  note that 
      this demo requires ñ2 Mb of ram and  works on ANY Atari even though 
      it ST coded...ð

          It all starts with a chip by MC Laser before  we are offered a 
      nice Japanese looking DHS logo by Edo. Then  more complete credits 
      come in a very stylish way  mixing  big and small letters. As most 
      St coders do nowadays Evil had to use a "trick" and  he decided to 
      use a 160x100 resolution for all the fx. The  first one is 3 light 
      blobs who fly around, combine and  merge. The colors are very well 
      chosen and óit looks great !ð The  palette changes  twice before the 
      lights are finally  turned off. Then  we  are acquainted  with the 
      title of  the  demo *ñ SWEETIEð * that comes along with  a very cute 
      and colorful picture representing a rabbit. 

          Next comes a pink  mapped tunnel. The  camera suddenly changes 
      axis, spinning around and  the tunnel is split into 2 still moving 
      ones. They  merge together and  move at the same  time, cool ! The 
      palette is set to a  grey scale while a picture by EdO is diplayed 
      beneath with a nice transparency effect. The following screen is a 
      blue bumpmapping with a * DHS * logo. Again it looks neat  and the 
      light source is different from a typical  bumpmap as it looks like 
      an octopus... Another cool  picture by  Edo follows. Note that the 
      ótransitions between fx and gfx are perfect.ð

          Then we see some blue circles, erm, I have  absolutely no idea 
      of how to call this. Maybe the least impressing screen. Still nice 
      as usual. Next one, on  the other hand, is my * FAVE * : imagine a 
      green textured tunnel. Oh, btw it has a bumpmapped fx on it too... 
      ñLooks really superb !!!!ð We are even offered  some synchro fx with 
      the music. Another pink tunnel comes right after and starts moving 
      with  a blurring  effect. Another fullsize  and  Japanese inspired 
      painting by EdO (very cool am I to add this ? 8-) The last part is 
      a 320x200 blue mapped tunnel  with light  effects that again  uses 
      some synchronisation with the music which is coming to an end.

          The screen is only  left blank  for a few secs before we reach 
      óthe End  partð  accompanied by  a cool chip by  Dma Sc. This screen 
      features a pretty  Japanese woman  on the  right  side, a neat DHS 
      raytraced and spinning logo (at 60 fps !) on the left and a 1 plan 
      interlaced white  font on  top of  the logo. Then you  can quietly 
      read some texts while  listening to the  pleasant music. Good idea 
      to have an Endpart as so few demos still have one.

          óBottom line :ð the first steps of ST code done by Evil are just 
          ó-----------ð   ñamazingð. This  guy could move  from Falcon to ST 
      blindfolded ! The overall design and piccies  quality is up to the 
      demo : of óhigh qualityð. Not to forget  the two chippies that bring 
      even more energy  to the whole thing. Last but not least, the only 
      negative point, is  that St users who don't have 2 Mb of ram won't 
      be able to enjoy it but Evil said the demo takes about 1.7 Mb ! Do 
      the maths then. Except for  this "detail" this  demo is definitely 
      great, get it now !

      NB : this demo uses the òextended palette of the STeð so the colors 
      shown in the enclosed pictures are ñdifferentð from the original.
