                      ------------------------------


          I feel a little ashamed when  writing this article  because it 
      has already been published in ToXic Mag 16... but it was in French 
      so I came up with the - sooooo original - idea to translate it for 
      the numerous people who can't read  this babarian  language that I 
      call mine : French ! Ok let's stop the crap here.

          The purpose of this article  is to bring my  little experience 
      to newcomers  whether they are graphic  artists or  coders. Lately 
      new talents have  emerged and most of the time they feel down when 
      they read harsh critics  of their first  steps. But they must hold 
      their heads on and keep improving. I am no God of Arts or whatever 
      but here come some advice and examples that should help you a bit.

          I just want to add that  we must NOT feel inferior  or ashamed 
      by what has  been done before. Ok we're not  the best, but who the  
      hell cares ? It takes time  to improve  and motivation is going to 
      be your daily fuel !


         ñI. Back In Timeð
    
          > Unless you feel ~ very ~ self confident or if you are a real 
      genius, you can  pick up a  few oldies  and watch  them  again and 
      again, trying to note every little  detail. Inspiration can pop up 
      from an older ST - or  even  Falcon - demo  such  as : Flip'O (you 
      cannot ignore it), Froggies  Over  The Fence (the mainpart on disk 
      one  is incredibly stuffed with tiny nice looking  details), demos 
      by tSCc, Accs, Cream, Avena and so on...


         òII. Then Came Light !ð

          > Who the hell ever told you that this 320x200 window (beurk!) 
      should always be black ? Not considering the opportunity to change 
      color 0 is  criminal 8-) As  an  instance  you  can refer to  many 
      tSCc's prods or to our humble gfa  demo called Back In  France (by 
      LOud!). The only question  remaining, once  you have chosen a nice 
      color for  your  background is : how will next color appear ? Will 
      you use a typical fading or maybe a "curtain system" ? There is no 
      limit to the various possibilities, just your imagination !


         óIII. Are You Blind Or What ?ð

          > The legendary  scrolltext (or mere texte) is a decisive part 
      of your work, at least for the credits. Then, please  make it look 
      nice for once ! Never use ripped material, it's baaaaad 8-) If you 
      are a lonely coder you can still ask a graphician of another group 
      to help you, we are  no  selfish  dogs  come on ! Also if  you can 
      display more than 1 color than better use a nice looking font that 
      uses maybe 5 or 6 colors. It doesn't mean 1plan fonts look crap, a 
      few ones look nice but it also depends  on their  color beside the 
      background, think about it twice.

          > Size can  sometimes  be a  problem too... And obviously I am 
      still talking about  fonts 8-) The  first  demos  on  ST literally 
      adored huge 32x32 (or bigger !!) fonts. It doesn't mean we want to 
      see such monsters again, please ! Also traditional scrolltexts are 
      horizontal or vertical (waouh !!!) but you can think about another 
      route  for your letters. Have a  look at the  cool idea of Jace in 
      the intro of Toxic Mag 14.
    

         ñIV. Gat No Money To Hire A Graphician !ð

          > Curiously, have you noticed that  most fresh demos  terribly 
      lack graphics ? Am I paranoid or what ? NO pictures ??? Don't tell 
      me that all graphicians have been swallowed by a huuge whale... Ok 
      we're not so many left but most of us (mOd, Agent -t, eDo or me St 
      Survivor 8-) are deeply willing to  be involved  in many projects. 
      Try contacting us - or others not mentioned - and ask us for help, 
      we're not so  bad you know. Also it can  save old, forgotten demos 
      to see the light after  so long ! We  need  collaboration  to save 
      what's left !


          > The real hard-coders can even think about the different uses 
      of a picture. Do you plan to display it like a  dull painting in a 
      museum ? Ok when it's 320x200 I guess you cannot do more. But with 
      smaller pictures you can still code a small fx to go with. Another 
      weird rule is that coders and gfxmen cannot work together. We seem 
      not to aim at the same  results  but  what are  we working for ? A 
      stunning demo with poor gfx  or maybe a nice  looking demo with no 
      technique ? Ask yourself what the other guy wants.

          > Ok you've got ideas, original and  nicely designed but there 
      is no available graphician for you ! It happens sometimes 8-( Then 
      why don't ask your old contact who is now retired or - brainwashed 
      by Quake 2 or Halflife - to give  you  his old, unused  gfx ? Just 
      like with treasures you must look for them to find out beauties !! 
      I also know many gfxmen who are still depressed  because their gfx 
      have never been used. Make the both of you happy !

  
         òV. Ready... Set... GO !ð

          > Ok now to... ideas ! You've got none ???? Erm yeah I know it 
      happens too. Don't panic and  discover lots  of  sources  of great 
      inspiration. Start with the satellite  channels such  as MCM, MTV, 
      M6 Music, Viva... Most of them use and abuse dots tunnels, sort of 
      plasmas, scrolltexts  and  much  more. Haven't you  ever watched a 
      video that made you wonder what was the name  of this wellknown ST 
      effect ? We could also debate on who's copying who but let's do it 
      another time, ok ? 

          > If you still cling to your old black and white boring TV set 
      then open a  magazine, esp  women  stuff, or  even a  catalogue of 
      clothes or whatever. No kidding ! Most of them are neatly designed 
      and creative. Try and  have a  look at  music or even  video games 
      magazines they're rich of details.


                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          Ok that's it... I hope some of you have read it  till the end. 
      Again I'm no GOD, I just want to help you avoid the worst when you 
      can easily get better. My main purpose was to reassure the rookies 
      Ok you're not quite a genius but so what ? It took them long years 
      too ! Most  beginners  think  about  quitting  after  getting only 
      negative feedback  from  their first  demos. Be good  to  them and 
      remember how hard it was when YOU started...
 
          Last words : go to work and good luck !
