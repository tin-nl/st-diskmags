Well this is the third and last of the EIL'99 intros, unfortunately for those 
poor sods without one, it is falcon only.

Now what happens then, after fading in and out the bits of title you get a nice
view across some water to land. The water is bump mapped and is moving around 
reflecting the sunlight (orange, sunrise or set?). Playing in the background 
all this time has been an Art of Noise Module by the Ex-Tommy of Avena. 

Now onto the main point of the Intro the invitation text, once gain you have 
the EIL logo in the background and over the top is the text, no other effects 
here. If you use the up/down keys to scroll then you may find it a little slow 
but there is a fast option, the left/right keys. Unfortunately after that its 
zip :P

The last thing to mention is that there is a copy of the full invite text with 
including the German, French and Polish versions. Of course these are a bit 
useless now with the event over :)

Overall I think this was better than the 2nd Intro, even if there isn't an 
ending to it. <Goes off and makes up random number> :)
