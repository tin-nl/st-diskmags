                                   an Error in Line'99 release ó[Falcon]ð (1999)
                         
                          
Sometimes they come back.
That was òThe Viking'sð first music demo called when he got back from the US.

Sometimes, they come back, make excellent music and write demos, but don't
release them.
That is basically what happened with ñModestð, a demo that was intended to
enter the ñ96kð-competition at the òQuaSTð-party in Poland 1998, but due to
several problems (especially with the organizers), óMind Designð decided to
ónotð enter the compo and ónotð release the demo.

Which is sad, no question.
The amount of demos released on the Falcon each month is easy to display
with just one hand and relatively close to zero. Therefore, it is especially
sad, if creative people like òThe Vikingð and òDeezð spend their time doing
a demo that isn't released at all then.
So obviously, people nagged at both of them often enough so they finally
decided to release it after all and enter the òFalcon-competitionð at
this year's Atari party.
And that is, what the ñreadme-fileð of this demo says.

The demo requires a very old-school òRGBð-Monitor and once you hooked your
Falcon to such a device, you can have some òMind Designð flair on your
Falcon.
It all starts with a ñMind Designð-logo on the screen. This is shortly
followed by the word ñModestð and some credits. Most of the coding and
all the music is by òThe Vikingð, some additional code is from òDeezð
and òKalmsð. The text on the screen is then erased block by block to
init the first effect, which is a colourful ñtextured tunnelð that
rotates and moves very smoothly on the screen - and quite quick, too.
After the tunnel has been removed by slowly erasing the texture,
the words ñ"Life is a bumpy ride  This is too."ð are brought on screen
one by one.
Guess what follows next.
Yes, it's really a ñbumpmapperð. The words òMind Designð in a slim font
on a blue background is nicely illuminated by a circle of light, that is
being moved smoothly over the scenery.
And since òDeezð is in love with ñblobsð, the demos shows some.
Well, "some" is perhaps a bit underestimated. It's a good dozen of them
that move in front of a dark, but moving background.
Although not every blob interacts with all the others, these bright discs
of blue behave like ñblobsð and move, melt and tear up again.
The next effect is very odd. It is called a "ñVoxelballð" and that's
basically what it is. A small scenery of ñVoxelspaceð-landscape is being
displayed, but not simply flat on the ground but bent on the surface of
a ball - or rather the surface of something presumably round. ;-)
In a very old-school manner, the demo then displays the credits for each
part with a small screenshot of the effect and the credits directly next
to it. Those screenshots are being scrolled on screen horizontally along
with the text before the demo ends itself with the words "ñThe endð.

This demo was meant to enter the 96k-compo at the QuaST party.
Therefore it should be judged as a ñ96k-troð and not as a real, full ñFalconð-
demo like òAliveð or òRetenantð.
And although it might probably not beat the best 96-ktro so far, òTerrorizeð
òyour soulð, it is definetly one of the better 96-ktros.
First, the design is indeed very óMind Designð-like. òThe Vikingð made some
really nice music for it in his very typical style, and even though the 
logos, the text and most of the other graphics are not exactly stunning, 
they have surely have ñstyleð and fit into the rest of the demo as well.
The effects are probably not very astonishing either, most of them have been
seen in other demos before. But that doesn't mean that they are bad as they
all are presented in a very nice style, the tunnel in the beginning is 
colourful and smooth, the bumpmapper looks good, the dozen of blobs is nice
as well and the ñVoxelballð is indeed an interesting effect.

I have hardly seen demos that cling this tight to their names like this
one does. ñModestð is the best name this 96-ktro could have been given.
All the effects are presented in a ñmodestð way, not spectacular, but
flawless, the design good, but not astonishing, the music good, but not
mind-bending, the graphics do their job, but not very much more.
As a 96-ktro, this demo is even modest when it comes to the diskspace
it needs. ;-)

Nevertheless, comparing it with the 96-ktros i have seen so far, ñModestð
can stand close to the best demos in that category. Comparing ñModestð to
ñTerrorize your soulð is a bit like comparing ñ4orceð to ñFluð.
ñ4orce/Terrorizeð are superior technically, feature more effects and run
longer, but ñFlu/Modestð clearly display superior design and more sense
for details.
So ñModestð is a good 96-ktro for sure. Sad that it had been compared with
full-length Falcon demos at the óError in Line 99ð, otherwise it would have
gotten more credit.

Arrrgghh!!! RGB, I need to buy a multisync. Now I've got my TV connected via
SCART I can watch, hey a nice intro screen, text appears in time with the music
A psychedelically coloured textured tunnel. More text appearing in time with 
the music to introduce the bumpmap. Next are a load of small blobs, but they 
seem to spend to much time apart. Now a voxel ball, a few times this has left 
droppings around the the area it rotates in. Lastly the credits and "THE END"

Good but short (a bit like my reviews :) )
