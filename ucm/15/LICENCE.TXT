     Licenses and User-agreements in the everyday life with computers.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

You probably wonder what this article is doing in a magazine like
this.

I was browsing through some old computer magazines of mine and found
a very interesting article in a magazine named "Happy computer"
from 1987, which is even more up to date than it would seem at first.

You probably heard about "Windows refund".
People who acquired a copy of Windows without wanting it, because
it came bundled with the computer or something, are able to "refund"
it. You may have seen this yourself, when you install Windows 9x or
NT, you usually get a dialogue box which displays a list of 
coniditions you automatically agree to by installing this software.
However, you have the choice to click "I do not accept" and 
installation stops.
Usually, people stopped here.
But the legal basis offers the user more than meets the eye. Because
you do not agree to those terms you have the right to refund the
software-package, in this case Windows 9x and get the original money
back.

However, this is tricky. Since the retailer you got Windows from
has nothing to do with the software licence agreement you decided
not to accept, he can not be forced to pay you back.
On the other hand, since he is responsible for the fact that you
got and bought a copy for a software package you obviously didn't
want to have, he is involved in some way for sure.

This is where it starts to get serious. In America, some retailers
have already been forced to "refund Windows" by a court-sentence.
German retailers already took deep cover and didn't say anything so
far, hoping that no one will ask.
The internet has already started the "refund Windows" campaign which
COULD cost Micro$oft a fortune, if legal ways are being affirmed by
the appropriate courtrooms.


When browsing through an old magazine, like mentioned above, i found
an interesting article related to those license-agreements and the
user's rights about those.
The problem is not all new and is therefore known since 1987.
I translated this article for you, it is from issue 5, May 1987,
page 17 of the Happy computer magazine.

It caused me to smile quite several times ... There is really no
progress at all. ;-)

Original Article:

òAre licenses legal ?

More and more software-producers slowly get off copy-protections.
Instead the disks are being shipped in sealed envelopes. By breaking
this seal the user agrees to a list of terms. Those terms on the
other hand violate some existing laws themselves.

Copy-protections, rather common and popular just a year ago, are
slowly losing popularity. Because no user is happy about not being
able to create backups of his expensive software. Is the original
getting defective, it has to be sent in and copied again. This costs 
the user time and patience, additionally, copy-protected programs
can not be installed on a hard-disk without problems. Some programs
feature their own routines to install the program on harddisk exactly
once. Only after a correct "deinstallation" of the program, it can
be installed anew. But what to do in case of technical defects like
a head-crash ?

Unsatisfied customers and the decrease in profit are the reasons
for a new way for the software-developers. No copy-protection could 
prevent pirates from copying the program for long, the everlasting
fight between copy-protecters and the pirates has been won by the
pirates long ago. Usually it takes only a few days after the release
of a new program until a pirate copy is available that can easily
be copied further. Exactly this time-span is when as many disks
are to be sold as possible to make any profit at all. If pirate
copies are being available even before the official release due
to leaks in the company itself, chances for a succesfull release
and marketing of the product are really low. Especially as there
are programs that even enable a beginner to get around simple
copy-protections. Programs like "Unguard" and "CopyWrite" from
McQuaid are the rather popular ones. Enough reason for the
software-developer to find a new way. The new strategy is to
bind the user to specified rules through a licence-contract.
Since hardly any user would actually sign such a contract, this
contract is to be signed by opening the package.

But already the term "purchase" is not 100% correct in regard
to software. Only the media-carrier, in this case the diskette,
is being transferred to the customer.
The user himself only purchases the right to use the software,
which is entitled "licence", although legally not 100% correct.
The user is therefore not the "purchaser" of the product but
just the licence-partner. The other licence-partner is the
developer, not the retailer, with whom the purchaser has made
a purchasement-contract. The relationsship between both licence-
parties is defined by the licence-contract. It is usually printed
on the sealed envelope containing the disk. Before one can work
with the program, one has to tear the envelope open. But caution!
There is more or less in miniature letters printed on the envelope
that the opening of this package is equal to agreeing to all
the terms stated. Such "tear-open-contracts", as they are called,
are being signed in the eyes of the software industries by opening
the package.
If one does not agree to the terms, one is supposed to bring back
the sealed package to the retailer and regain the money paid. But,
the contract with the retailer has been agreed upon long ago and
does not automatically include the licence-contract. It is possible,
that the retailer refuses to take back the contract he has with the
customer. Getting back the money can evolve to be a real problem
now, in which the customer is on the weaker side, so it seems.
Before payment, the customer usually doesn't know, what he is about
to agree to, he therefore has to buy the "cat in the bag" ð(a german
phrase for buying something without having seen it)ò. The actual
terms usually fill more than one page and are hard to understand
for the average. But not enough: Parts of those terms may stand
in objection to several laws and therefore do not apply. The request
of the "North american Software GmbH" to its customers to destroy
or return the program when not using it anymore is for example not 
valid. "Is the right of usage not being applied anymore by the
licence-partner or it is no longer valid, the licence-partner has
to destroy all product-software, including documentation or other
material, in his possession or has to return it free of charge 
to the authorized retailer."
Such unusual and weird rules, one tends to think. But it really
shows up in this form or slightly modified in several licence-
contracts. In analogy, a customer who bought a book would have to
return it to the bookshop after reading it or to burn it. The 
company Microsoft ("WORD", "MS-DOS") doesn't even allow to
give their software as a gift. Equally invalid are rules which
prevent the customer from selling the program, in case he doesn't
like it. Of course he has to include all existing backups or has
to destroy them. Additionally, these contracts contain inaccuracies
or objections in themselves. The statements to such a contract
stated on page 18 ð(will follow)ò clearly display that those
contracts usually feature a bad concept and do not follow german
law.
The customer stays in the bad position, who is not up to those
conditions. Therefore, customers should stay away from buying
products that feature this kind of licences. Or make a written
contract with the retailer. Except for the licence-contract on
the backside, the package usually contains a postcard to be
returned to the producer. It features the serial-number of the
program and is supposed to be filled in and sent back to the 
producing company. This is meant for sending out updates and other
news on the one hand. On the other hand, the procuder encourages
the customer to agree to the contract once again, this time in written 
form. It is absolutely intolerable to grant the right of usage only
to the customer when he sent in the card.
In case the company offers support or help for its products, the
information provided on this card is supposed to help identify
the customer from the others. It is of course acceptable that
companies want to prevent themselves from being used by other than the 
rightfull owners.
But not every software-company tries to scare off pirates by special 
licence-contracts. Usually, it stays to be a more or less explicit
part on the first page of the manual. But not even here, the rules
follow the law necessarily.. The company "Data Becker" in Duesseldorf
for example only wrote a few lines, but wanted to prohibite the
user from making backups. Such a condition is not valid according to
german law. But even this company sells more and more unprotected
software. Reason is, according to the a press-release by Mr. Spannig, 
are the problems arising for the customer by this policy. Software
reviews usually feature copy-protections as a negative aspect by now 
anyway.
Another concept is followed by Thomas Tempelmann ð(now working for
Application Systems Heidelberg and involved in for example MagicMac)
ò, the author of "F-COPY", one of the most popular copy programs for
the C64. He distributes a part of his newer products as shareware.
Everyone is allowed to copy them, the moderate fee of 20.- DM is
to be sent when one likes the product. Tempelmann: "With FCOPY i
have seen that this concept works. In germany, this program has
been sold as usual, in america, payment was not forced in any way.
Exactly this has brought more."

ò"This condition does not work this way..."ð
òStatements from the lawyer Dr.Jochen Schneider to "tear-open-
licence-contracts" by the company "North American Software GmbH",
that distributes the wordprocessor "Euroscript" among others.
"The contract has to  make clear, who the contract-partner of the
customer is and who is the dealer according to the contract:
Is he only the executive of the software company or is he the
real retailer. Since most licence-contracts suggest him as the
one to contact, it seems that he is the contract-partner for
the customer. But then, there is no room for an additional contract, 
if the retailer does not mention this second licence-contract 
explicetly in the contract he makes with the customer. All following 
statements therefore take this inclusion of this second contract for 
granted.
1. The contract usually takes for granted, that the customer has
acquired the disk in the envelope by the authorized retailer and
has already paid for it. Does the customer at home not agree to the
terms, he has to give the disk back. The contract with the retailer
on the other hand is already valid. The conidition, that the customer 
sees the effective contract only at home and not earlier and 
therefore has to send the disk back is not valid this way. The 
authorized retailer should have mentioned the conditions of the 
licence-contract already in his contract with the customer.

2. The licence-giver usually doesn't mention a real address, the disk 
is supposed to be sent back to the authorized retailer, who is also 
supposed to return the money. This on the other hand is mentioned in 
the contract with the licence-giver and not in the contract with the
retailer. However, this has to be accepted with the retailer. Who is
supposed to be contacted by the customer if the retailer refuses this?
Under some conditions, the right of usage can be taken back according
to some licence-contracts. How is the customer supposed to know, if 
someone can legally force him to return the product if the contract-
partner is not specified clearly ? A contract on behalf of a third
party however is not valid.

3. The licence-contract does not name the product it is about 
explicetly. It also doesn't mention the intended usage. Without such 
details, defects like nonexistant functions can not be affirmed 
properly, only defects like total disfunction.

4. When the contract starts to be valid is totally undefined. 
Inaccuracies in the common terms of trade usually affect the
user.  It stays undefined, if this starts to be valid when signing, 
when sending in (when did it arrive ?) when paying or by the
"usage without sending back the registration card", mentioned 
explicetly in the contract. Since the customer has to do something
to activate the contract, but also to prevent himself from the
threatened legal actions (in case of disagreement), the contract puts 
him on the weaker side. The referring conditions can also be invalid
as so-called surprise-conditions.

5. Such a contract is invalid, if it puts the customer into the 
position of an owner who buys or an owner who rents at the same time.
One part of the contract refers to the usual contracts of 
purchasement, the other part rather refers to a contract of rentage.

6. The licence-giver usually doesn't even have the ownership, although
it sounds like that in the contract.

7. In contracts like this, the rights of usage by the customer are
being decreased in some way: The customer is not allowed to give away 
the product or to resell it. According to the literature (...) such
a condition is invalid. Only the condition that forces the product to 
be used only at one place at once, therefore not by several people on 
several machines, seems to be valid.

8. A contract is not supposed to feature conditions about what the
licence-giver supplies and about the time the contract stays valid at 
the same time. On the other hand there may not be a condition which 
refers to disengaging the contract after a specified time as this
is based on a non-restriced contract when it comes to time.
Such objections, like having to destroy the product when not using it 
anymore, are on behalf of the licence-giver.

I apologize for the bad translation, the original text is full of 
phrases and terms that are damn hard to translate, especially for 
someone who does not have anything to do with laws in everyday life.

I hope you get the picture though.
This article made me wonder a little.
The problems of those "tear-open-contracts" have been know in 1987 
already and yet so many large companies, especially Micro$oft, has 
used it so many times.
Micro$oft even pushed the whole concept to its limits and yet may see 
itself confronted with a whole lot of ex-windows users who now want to 
refund their copies of Windows or other bundled software they do not 
want to use. The legal basis is obvious, Micro$oft has to take it back 
and return the money.
Of course Micro$oft will twist and turn and search for a way to get 
out of this mess as usual with the customer being the loser again.

But it's not only Micro$oft. Even packages that do not feature one 
single line of what's inside feature a "By opening this seal you agree 
and accept to the terms listed above"-seal in the meantime, when there 
are no terms of agreement or contracts are listed anywhere on the 
package.
I wonder where this will end.
In the worst or best case, a lot of companies will have a lot of 
trouble with those contracts that were supposed to protect them and 
may now do a lot of harm ...
