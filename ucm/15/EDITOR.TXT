Hello together...

Time to write some lines on my ST again... and it's the first time that I touch
an editor on the ST at all since many weeks.

Some of you surely have checked  that the  announced release  date of  UCM 15 is
laying back about one month now and I'm really sorry about this. There are a lot
of reasons for this and that this issue has finally seen the light of day is the
result of the massive kicks of several people who put a lot of work more into it
as myself and finally I found the motivation to release it to do  them a favour,
if they had not helped me UCM 15 wouldn't be here and maybe never come...

At the  moment I'm  not sure about  the history of  UNDERCOVER... errr... I will
just use the words "semi-professional family" and this has to say all... My time
is slipping away and I don't know how to hold it back.
Ok, some people said, this is coming and going... but since 2 months my computer
related time is  shrinking and shrinking, and I don't feel sad or nerved because
of this! This  is the main problem for me! In former times I was pissed  if some
things where stealing my time for making the UCM, today it doesn't care to me at
all, just the point that I'm not the only one behind the mag, better the FRIENDS
who are working together with me, is my last stronghold to go on...

I was surprised that even the ERROR IN LINE party doesn't brought back the compy
fanatism  again, I came back home and  needed 4 days to install all  my machines
again, a thing I  did in former  times on  the same day... furthermore I  needed
much longer to start any of my Atari's again! Even my new Falcon doesn't brought
back the vibe...

But hey, I will not go onto your nerves with my "problems" and stuff... the main
thing is that UNDERCOVER finally hit' the lines of the Atari scene!

          Hi there and welcome to this  new UCM ! No the mag isn't  dead yet 8-) 
As you probably know I've been in charge of the French diskmag toXic Mag for the 
last FIVE years and  have  finally  decided  to  leave it  because of  a lack of 
contributions... 

          I feel both honoured and apprehensive to be the main editor of * UCM *
which is the ultimate link between the surviving actors of the underground Atari 
scene. The survival of UCM implies a lot from me but also from YOU ! I will soon 
set up an 'article  construction  kit' that  will  teach you how  to include big 
headlines, colors (up to 4 different  ones) and 16 colors pics. Enough  crap all 
of this you'll hear about later on DHS homepage.

          What could I say  now ? Earx's  shell is great and so easy to use. The 
only bug left (hey who told you this issue was 100 % bug free ???) is related to 
the sidvoices but  Earx will work  on it and  hopefully solve it. Anyway most of 
the spirit of a UCM headed by Moondog will have survived and as I finish to type 
these lines I hope you will feel that this good old feeling is still here...

          This issue may not be complete, maybe you expected more not to mention 
the huuuuuuuuge delay due to the change within the team, well then I will accept 
comments or critics but you will have to give us a hand if you want things to be 
improved.

          I won't  give  you any release date for UCM 16 because I don't want to 
feel pressured. Also I want you to  be aware that the release mainly  depends on  
you. In other words if you want UCM16 to be released soon send me  some material  
or simply contact me to join the UCM mailinglist at ósurvivor@atari.orgð

          See ya soon on ò#atariscneð
