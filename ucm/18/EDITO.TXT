ñ---------------------ðò Last Editorial Of The Milleniumðñ -------------------------

    That's it, the last UCM of the year/century/millenium is out !!! I am really 
proud of this issue as never before I had been so supported by my fellow sceners 
and that's  really nice  to see  so many  ócaring  friendsð ! Before I  forget the 
goodies folder contains the sources to Candyman and Earx's coding articles.

    The year 99 soon finished was òrichð with releases and events : great demos by 
DHS, Checkpoint, Cream, Equinox and  many  others  and  no one  who attended the 
parties held this year will contradict me when I say that Error In Line, the Pre 
Millenium Party and Paracon2 (for the most  significant) have  shown that we are 
still óALIVEð and that our scene  is much  more than a  mere gathering of computer 
freaks but a real  community  which cherishes ò friendshipð more than anything. Of 
course we have all had bad times and  disappointments but  basically though less 
numerous than years ago we  are still standing  proudly and defend the values we 
believe in, not  only  the right to  use alternative systems but also to protect 
this beloved community we belong to.

    Erm I'm not going to cry but believe me the  Scene is a second  family to me 
and to many of us  so óI thank you  allð for the  shared happiness  and wish you a 
Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year in the shape of the fuji logo :)

    Dunno what next year will be made of but surely we can expect more releases 
and cool parties so I hope to meet all of you, my friends, there !

    In the meantime take care and enjoy this 18th issue of UnderCover Magascene
