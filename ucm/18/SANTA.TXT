     Hehe , everybody knows the story about óChristmasð . A big man who's named 
Santa Claus bring a lot of presents to all the children of the Earth ... But , 
nobody asks the question : How does Santa Claus manage to be everywhere at the  
same moment ! :-) Ha Ha ! (or maybe Ho Ho Ho :-) Everybody thinks this man uses 
òanimalsð name reindeers to move him, hum it's impossible.. I think there are 
ñcomputersð hidden behind all these things :-) and what computer can he use ??? 
Hehe Santa Claus is maybe the best coder on earth :-P No no I don't think so but 
I hope for him he doesn't use a PC, can you imaging the catastrophe on December 
24th ? A lot of bugs etc ...

Hehe I think I talk nonsense, he uses of course an òATARIð !!!! Whatever sort of 
computer (ST, Falcon...) and when he says " HO HO HO " he means ATARI RULEZZZ !!

     The next time you stand close to him, ask him the question, or look at his 
T-Shirt, maybe He wears one with a big logo "I LOVE ATARI" :-)) 

     Good luck if you plan to meeting him and ask him for a new atari :-) 


       Ho Ho Ho Good Reading guys :-)
