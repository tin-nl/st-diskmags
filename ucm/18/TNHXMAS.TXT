ñTNHXmasð by òTeenageð [A DHS Xmas compo release] (óSTEð) 1999

Now, let's play "what would be, if ...".
Let us think that we have a relatively simple òTNHð logo accompanied
by a relatively simple ñXmas 1999ð logo. Let us also pretend that after
a graphic displaying those logos faded away, a relatively simple static
starfield is being displayed.
Let us further consider that this starfield is then slowly and unsmoothly
scrolled down to display a relatively simple "South Pole"-sign pointing
to the right, mounted in a small heap of relatively simple snow.
We could now imagine that the screen fades down again to make place for
a relatively simple christmas card, surrounded by relatively simple small
graphics about snowman delivering presents in a bunch of christmas trees.
If you could follow this far, you might also imagine that the bottom part
of the screen is now being filled by an approx. 16 pixels high scroller
featuring relatively simple graphics, moving relatively smooth, but
relatively slow, telling some relatively uninteresting stuff about how
this demo was created by who.
Let us pretend that all this was accompanied by a relatively simple
pseudo-gabber version of ñRudolph the rednoseð that just violates the
laws of harmonics every once in a while.

If you can imagine all this, voila, you have imagined the ñTNHXmas 99ð
intro. If it had been presented with a little more spice, it wouldn't
be just a relatively mediocre intro. I had to grin about the Rudolph
remix once, but since it is badly disharmonic, it isn't a real highlight
either. If the textscroller hadn't been that slow and really only telling
stuff nobody wants to read in the beginning of a scroller, it might have
been entertaining to at least read something. If the christmas card and
its surrounding graphics hadn't been so really small and simple, they
might have been good for some nice christmas feeling.

But since it is all so relatively relative, it is just a simple intro
with no spice at all. Sorry to say so.
