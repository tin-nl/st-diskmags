ñThe Cracker reviewð by òThe Paranoidð

Before i start this review, i would like to mention a few things.
First, of course i haven't tested òallð disks by ðallð crackers.
This time, i'd like to review mainly those cracks featured on
compact disks, like for example òFuzionð, òPompey Piratesð and
so on.
Furthermore it is not possible to review every crack from every
cracker either. Too many disks, too many patches and also, too
many known bugs that even the crackers themselves sometimes admit.
Therefore, this is more a subjective view about this part of the
scene than really an objective review - which i personally consider
impossible anyway.
If you spot mistakes or would like to object to some of the points
mentioned here, please feel free to contact me or publish an 
addendum in the next issue of ñUCMð.

ñTested programs and disksð
People on the IRC know that i personally dislike to copy or "pirate"
application software or software that is still being supported and
developed, i don't really consider this software here.
I will mainly focus on ñgamesð here.
Therefore, i tested compact disks from òAutomation, Medway Boys, Cynix,ð
òPompey Pirates, Flame of Finland, Superior, Elite, Vectronix and D-Bugð.

òAutomationð
Automation has around 500 compact disks, mainly with games on them only
in a very few cases they also feature docs, helps and cheats.
This series of disks started very early so even though they feature
a lot of disks, they still have mainly the "classical" stuff.
ñProsð
- Runs relatively reliable on a real Atari ST
- Large number of disks available
- Average pack-rate
- Packed programs can usually be executed from out of the menu as well
ñConsð
- Problems on extended STs, sometimes even the STE
- Rather limited to classical games
- Sometimes incompatible where the uncracked game runs (esp. Falcon)
ñmiscð
- In about 1/3 of all cracked games, it offers trainers
- Intro usually incompatible with extended STs, STEs and Falcons
- internal copy-protections like code-requests etc. normally removed.

òCynixð
Only a very small amount of Cynix menu-disks exist, i somewhere spotted
the number 7 but it is hard to affirm. Those disks only feature the
very games and no other information besides a menu at all. Trainer is
usually featured in most of the games.
Cynix compact disks feature some more special games that are usually
not contained on many other menu-disks. Due to the small number of disks
available, it is not very easy to compare though.
ñProsð
- Highly reliable on a real Atari ST and usually STE
- Well packed
- Rather special games
ñConsð
- Not very compatible with the Falcon and extended STs
- Only a very small amount of disks
- Menu is required (as far as i can see)
ñMiscð
- Could feature some more trainers and additional informations
- Menu relatively slick and functional
- internal copy-protections like code-requests normally removed

òD-Bugð
Advertised as "The only menus worth their diskspace", the D-Bug menus
are now also available on the net. They start where Automation ends
and therefore feature newer and less popular games that are usually
not easy to get from other menus. There seem to be around 190 disks.
The intro is usually small and occupies very little diskspace but is
usually somewhat simple. Trainers are included relatively often.
ñProsð
- Large number available
- less well-known games on the disks that are hard to get otherwise
- Good pack-rate
ñConsð
- Highly unreliable and buggy
- Limited to real ST, even a lot of problems with STE and Falcon
- odd bootsector
ñMiscð
- Odd diskformat, therefore hard to get to work without the menu
- Problems on systems with built-in harddisk
- internal copy protections may have been removed

ñElite/Empireð
There seem to have been two different Elites, one later renamed
ñEmpireð and the one that still exists and release new programs on
a rather regular basis. The menus i have are rather from the one
later renamed to the Empire that also cooperated with Equinox and
the Marvellous V8.
Elite has not only released single games but also a few menus.
Usually, those menus features a very very simple intro, just
displaying the Empire/Elite logo and which keys to press to get
which game. It's hard to tell if they feature compacted menus or
just menus as there is no depacking visible. Nevertheless, they
usually feature only games and no additional stuff.
ñProsð
- Reliable on ST and STE
- No strange menus or bootsectors
ñConsð
- Pack rate seems very low
- Hardly trainers or cheats included
- Very limited number of disks
ñMiscð
- Internal copy protection normally removed

ñEliteð
The other Elite still exists and still releases programs on a
regular basis. As the number of games being released is not very
large currently, they seem to have focused on application software
and tools. They seem to be one of the very rare groups that also
jumped on the Falcon at the time being and also cracked some Falcon
games.
Unfortunately, i don't have too many disks from Elite, so i really
can't judge them well.
From their current doings, they seem to be highly reliable and very
active.

òFlame of Finlandð
The FOF disks usually featured cracks by superior while FOF only
contributed the menu. There are around 70 FOF-disks which don't
feature very special games but a well selected choice of better
games, also from a rather large time-scale.
The menu stayed the same in all FOF menus mainly, they just varied
the music and the colour of the starfield a little, the menu
itself was always the same except for the music.
ñProsð
- The games are usually reliable on ST and STE
- The compact games can be executed from desktop usually
- A good choice of games compiled
ñConsð
- Not too many disks available
- Some intros/menus screw up on STE/Falcon without visible reason
  while some run without any problems even on the Falcon
- Sometimes, even the bootsector screws up on extended STs/STE
ñMiscð
- Usually some information about the games in the scroller of the menu
- Not too many trainers
- Average packrate

òFuzionð
Another compact disk series that went far beyond the 100, yet Fuzion
is less famous than most of the others. Usually, they feature a menu
along with a selector which game to run.
The choice of games features a wide range of games and yes, there
are some rather rare ones under them. Additionally, Fuzion kept up
their work until quite late and therefore, the last Fuzion disks
feature even the "newer" games.
ñProsð
- Good selection of games
- Nice looking intro
- Usually, trainer included
ñConsð
- Screwed up bootsector - forget booting with a HD connected
- Usually, totally incompatible with extended STE and Falcon
- Sometimes, screwed up cracks
ñMiscð
- Sometimes, some information about the games in the scrollers
- Average packrate

òMedway Boysð
Medway Boys were not only busy releasing one compact disk after the
other but also for their virus-checking bootsector. The Medway Boys
started relatively early and although they released quite a number
of games, the games on the disks are not only the super-hits but
the super-flops as well and they only feature rather early games
from the "Automation time".
Medway Boys also had "one" intro after a certain menu they kept for
all the other menus.
ñProsð
- Relatively reliable games on ST and STE
- Often enough, games could be executed without the menu
- Large amount of games due to good packrate
- Bootsector protector
- Simple, but functional menu
ñConsð
- Medway Boys Bootsector has some troubles on some extended STs
  STEs and often enough the Falcon
- Rather classical games only
ñMiscð
- Trainers in a good amount of games
- Internal copy protection normally removed

òPompey Piratesð
The Pompey Pirates had always the aura of noble-class cracks.
They didn't release all kinds of games likle for example Automation
and Medway Boys did but mainly the better games. Although their
menus had a certain style after a specific menu, they always featured
good graphics and a nice soundtrack.
Additionally i assume Pompey Pirates feature the largest amount of
Trainers, Docs and Patches for their released games, some kind of
"user-support" in case earlier games refused to work on STE.
ñProsð
- Reliable games and usually, a reliable menu on ST and STE
- good packrate
- Excellent support, trainers, cheats and patches for previous
  releases such as STE incompatibilities
- In most cases, games can be executed directly.
ñConsð
- Not too many games, also from a rather limited range of time
- Tough to use for people with harddisks in case menu is required
- Early menus are sometimes buggy (although later menus patch that)
ñMiscð
- High amount of Trainers
- Internal copy protection usually removed
- Lots of docs and hints supplied

òSuperiorð
Superior continued the FOF series by themselves. Superior menus
usually have a very specific intro that varied in graphic and music
but usually not very much in style.
They have gotten famous mainly because of their superb usage of
"system resources", including RAM-disk drivers and in some rare
cases even harddisk-drivers, although they usually support only
FFLS-harddisk driver.
Because they more or less "follow" FOF, they started relatively
late and therefore feature rather young games on around 200 disks.
ñProsð
- quite a good amount of younger games
- good packrate
- Usually, the games can be run without the menu
- Games are usually well done and run on STE and Falcon (if the
  original run as well)
- Almost all games feature a Trainer and a RAM-disk, sometimes even
  harddisk support
ñConsð
- The menu is not as compatible as the Superior cracks are
- Sometimes a bit buggy, even within the game
- In some rare cases a screwy bootsector
ñMiscð
- Trainers more or less standard
- Internal copy protection in most cases removed

ñVectronixð
Yes, even Vectronix, famous for their continuing work on the Atari
platform and their cracks on the Falcon, had started cracking a lot
of Atari games from the early stages up to now.
Well, a lot may be a little overdone. Yet they released some very
rare Falcon and STE games. As they are still active - at least SJX
is - there are very new and late programs and games and hopefully,
they will feature some more.
ñProsð
- Highly reliable cracks
- Highly compatible with extended STs, STEs and Falcons
- Trainers and other cheats included
- Sometimes patched versions
ñConsð
- Very rare
- Even the released games are not easy to get
ñMiscð
- Features STE only and Falcon only intros sometimes
- Internal copy protection is always removed

óEpilogueð
So, you have a Mega STE, a tuned STE or a Falcon ? Maybe with an
internal harddisk that you need to prevent from booting ? Maybe you
have TOS 2.05 or 2.06 in your ST ? Maybe a later TOS in your Falcon ?
You have internet access and thus you have some sources to get those
games ? Therefore you want advice on which compact disks to avoid and
which ones to choose ? Then here is my advice.

Forget òFuzionð disks. These CDs are made for 1040 STf and this what
they run on. If you have an internal harddisk or -heaven forbid- a
tuned STE or Falcon, forget them. Booting from the disk produces
4 bombs usually and a resistant error, the games itself usually don't
run either.

Forget òD-Bugð. The "only menus worthy their diskspace" are a waste
of diskspace in most cases. I have about 12 Atari ST computer and only
4 a òD-Bugð-menu runs on - and even in the rare case that anything
besides the intro/menu runs, not all the content of the compact disk
will work usually. So the rather rich choice of disks that òD-Bugð
provides is useless in most cases.

òAutomationð has progressed within the time they did their menus and
that means: Early games will have problems on extended machines, later
cracks or re-cracks usually won't. Even if the intro or menu doesn't work,
the game itself may be executable when being renamed to .PRG. Therefore,
even if you have an extended STE or Falcon, give the later òAutomationð
disks a try. You may have to remove the bootsector sometimes though.

The same goes for òThe Medway Boysð. The menu is quite well programmed
and can be run on several "extended" systems. And even if not, the
òMedway Boysð have often been friendly to even include .PRG-files on
the disks. The later òMedway Boysð-Virus protector has gotten 
incompatible with extended systems and probably has to be removed.

Next stage: òFlame of Finlandð. Some of their disks have problems
with the intro on extended systems, some don't. But luckily, the
intro/menu are not very important, the games itself can usually
be executed by hand though, featuring òSuperiorð-quality. So try
them on your system, they usually work well.

Quite similar are òEliteð's disk - the few ones there are. The menus
are simple, but functional and usually work well on all Ataris. The
content has usually not been patched but not been made incompatible
either.

òCynixð compact disks are rare, but quite well done. The menu
usually runs flawlessly on the STE and/or the Falcon, the games
do as well in most cases. There are a few òCynixð-cracks that
refuse to work on the Falcon, but the òFalcon-Commandoð has
"repaired" some. So the try the few òCynixð-disks there are.

òPompey Piratesð have made their homework very well. When they saw
problems with their own cracks on the STE, they re-released a patched
version or a patch. Their early, incompatible intros have been skipped
and been replaced by more compatible ones. Nevertheless, there are
still some minor problems with Mega STEs or systems with built-in
harddisks or exotic TOS-versions, but you usually get the game to run
and additionally, òPompey Piratesð usually have trainers and docs.
A good choice.

òSuperiorð - a group with a very well chosen name. Although òSuperiorð
disks usually have menu that refuses to work on the Falcon, it  works
fine on ST and STE. Nevermind about the intro, approximately all
òSuperiorð-games can be exectued by hand, they even feature the newer
games and they usually use extended RAM for RAM-disks, have trainers
and other goodies. Compatibility with extended systems is relatively
high, corrupt disks quite rare. A good choice for all Atari players.

The race is won by òVectronixð as far as i can see it. First because
it is the only group that does not even patch its own cracks but also
the games themselves - best example: Arkanoid. Second because it
features all the games the others don't feature. Third because òVexð
even continued the tradition on the Falcon, releasing games with
intros. And finally because òVexð-cracks are 100%. No corrupt disks,
no overseen copy protection, no quotes from the manual left to enter,
no code to type in. The best choice for your Atari.

So, this is all. If you happen to have a controversary opinion about
this, feel free to write an article yourself that may be featured
in one of the next issues of óUCMð. I do not consider the results
i've drawn absolute or very objective. I rather wrote this review
because i adore games and my 1040 STfs are all locked away in a
closet. The smallest computer i currently can access is a Mega STE
with an internal harddisk and TOS 2.05 and that can give you a hard
time with some games. Since even a lot of originals refuse to run
(Enchanted Land, X-out, Terrorpods for example), i tried quite some
cracks and here is the result.
So if you disagree, feel free to write your own opinion.
