This is a joint venture of all the ÚParanoia-fellows that are currently
active: ÚLuebke, MRF, Strange, Marcstar, Der Komtur and ÚThe Paranoid.
This is where everybody shares his thoughts about computers in this and
the next millenium, what is going to come, what is going to stay and what
is going to go.


ÚThe Paranoid: ÛAtari - meant to be Y2K-resistant
ÒI have started to watch the Atari scene since 1985, i bought my first
Atari ST 1989 and by now, i have a vast collection of many different
Atari computers. Atari is not only a simple gray box that can do tricks,
it is a way of thinking. We, the Atari-Users, have been a long time where
PC users are now. We have been using mice when they were hacking in cryptic
>commands. We have had a trashcan on our desktops when they had a dumb delete
command that couldn't delete recursively. And we laughed about them.
Today, things have changed. They have fast 3D accelerator cards, we don't.
They have clockspeeds of several hundred MHz, the fastest Falcon-speeder 
there currently is based on a 50 MHz 68030.
But we still laugh about them. We laugh about their helpless attempts to
prevent their machine from crashing while the company in charge of the
operating system obviously prevents the PCs from working.
And even now, on the edge of a new millenium, they have to struggle to keep
their computers working while we grin and go party instead.
Atari has been where no-one has been before and where the PC will not go
in a long time: Simplicity, user-friendlieness, reliability. Easy to code,
simple to operate, fun to use. PCs are still nowhere near that and will
probably never be.
PC-users will probably never be where Atari-users are today, in a scene
of knowing each other, helping each other and caring about each other.
And that's what the next millenium will bring us. Atari is immortal.

                                 

Y2K and other bad things

Well, actually the year 2000 didn't affect me very much in the last few months.  
I couldn't understand the excitement about this turn of the year, because I 
don't  think that my toaster won't work again next year.  ;-)
But there's one thing that I'm a little bit concerned about. That may be a 
little bit exaggerated, but what about all the nuclear weapons around the world. 
 What will happen to them on january 1st? I hope nothing will happen..... 
There are also things that hopefully WILL happen. I hope that any M$ System will 
crash - really CRASH. I think that's necessary for the mostly part of the people 
to wake up and to see what has happened to them. I hope that they see that they 
are no longer free though they are told that they are free  
 There must come a time, where people think by themselves but not only about 
 themselves. I hope there will come a time of peace and freedom for everyone.  

Merry Christmas an a happy new year...
