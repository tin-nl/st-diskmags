"I think you did a rather ok job on the latest UCM. I especially
enjoyed Grey's article on Deam being a lamer. Now I finally have some
proof. The pic of TiNKer in the nude is cool, too. Let's make UCM 18 even better
 and bigger." 

ÒSTS words : thanks a lot Pheno ! I enjoyed your stupid and loony piece of 
Òarticle and hope to see more articles follow up :)

"since you always lack feedback, here come my comments about UCM 17: :-)

I consider it a good magazine, probably lacks a few details and i can't
help feeling that it has been compiled in a hurry. The reviews are a bit
short and they somehow depend on the taste of the reviewer a little too
obviously, but otherwise, they are pretty good.

You shouldn't put your personal opinions into the News-section though.
Considering a game, a demo or a release in the news section "bad", "lame"
or "good" is something not to be done. The news section is supposed to
display only objective facts, not any personal opinions.
Otherwise you shouldn't abuse the magazine to bash against a certain
french coder who has no chance to react on the same level or defend
himself. This means abusing the power UCM gives you to put a very single-
sided version of the story into existance which is neither fair to him nor
good for the magazine, sorry to say so.

Last but no least, i couldn't get it to run on my 4 MB Falcon using an RGB
Monitor, i will have to retry on my VGA-Falcon tonight. It ran fine on the
Mega STE 4 from disk though.


Concerning the IRC-Simulator:
Sorry, can't understand your point there. I agree it is lame (it was
intended to be, it was done in around 3 hours or less) but there is
absolutely no point that should have concerned evil. I therefore cannot
see why you can understand that evl feels pissed off by it. It isn't aimed
at Evil and it says in no way "Evil is the bad guy".
This is pure interpretation - you can of course write this in the review,
but i can't understand it.

ÒSTS words : I know I was in a real fucking mood when I finished UCM 17 and to be 
Òhonest though I don't feel much better now I'll try not to mix my personal and 
Ò"professional" views. The story about that French coder was and still is a big 
Òdisappointment to me but it must be buried and it's none of your problem so 
Òaccept my apologies... Instead I should have paid more attention to the shell I 
Òused for UCM17 as I took the buggy one (well the correct one is exactly the same 
Òsize and I have at least 5 different shells on my HD :( Anyway by now the fixed 
Òshell can be downloaded from DHS and I'll try not to get confused again sorry. 
ÒAbout the IRC simulator : you and I perfectly know that some ppl are so deeply 
Òinvolved in the scene today that any critic is taken personal. If someone says 
Òsome gfx, msx or article sucks in UCM I feel personally responsible for it and 
ÒEvil did the same. I can understand that and I just regret inactive people 
Òdidn't feel touched by it :((
