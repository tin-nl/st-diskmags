ñBiomasð by òBlind Ioð (a DHS Xmas compo release) [óFalconð] (1999)


Ever heard of òBlind Ioð ? Not too many releases from him yet,
nevertheless, he has already proven that old-school effects are exactly
his game.
So what is his Christmas demo about ?
Old-school of course.
In the upper part of the screen we find a ñdrumrollð, coloured by a
òHBLð-routine with the credits of the demo scrolling through it:
òBlind Ioð did most of it while òBig Alecð did the music (a long time
ago). The middle part of the screen is filled by a rapidly moving
starfield with ñSanta Clausð in his slay and one reindeer moving over
it. Just below this you find rapidly moving tree-tops, nicely ñscrollingð
ñin 3 layersð over each other with different speeds.
The bottom part of the screen is filled by a scrolltext, also pretty
quick and slick, displaying some ñreverseð effect, a little similar to
the main-menu scroller of the óUnion-Demoð.

Sounds like "won't run on the Falcon", doesn't it ?
Luckily, it does. The speed of the music might be ruined, but the demo
itself runs very nicely on the Falcon indeed.

This entry has written ñold schoolð over it and yet runs nicely on extended
systems like Mega STE or Falcon. The effects presented are not really new,
but they are well done and flawless, the scroller features standard scroller
talk so there isn't anything to stare at for hours, but it surely deserves
to be looked at twice.
Nothing to get ecstatic about, but nice to watch though.
