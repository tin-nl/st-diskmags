ñCrimboð by òTormentð (A DHS Xmas compo contribution) ó[ST]ð (1999)

All of a sudden, they were back.
Simply back.
Like they never were away, the group named òTormentð, consisting of
óRhinoð, óSpinyð and óGNDð, reassembled itself again to simply do what
they like: Produce ñold-schoolð demos. As a replacement for the never
released/finished ñSwitching Channelsð, they gave us the short, but nice
ñTwitching Flannelsð at the óPMP 1999ð party, where i had the honour
to meet them and now they're back with a cute little entry for the
DHS Xmas compo.

The demo starts with some black text on white background, saying who
this demo is from, what it is supposed to be like and why it is in
the first place.
After that, you'll see a nice ñsnowmanð, a ñscrollerð in the upper part
of the screen (which is maybe ñ1 bplð but coloured by a ñHBL-routineð or
probably ñbplð and might also be out of border - read below why i'm not
sure) while ñsnow is fallingð straight downwards.

{*i crimbo.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

The snow doesn't simply fall down but even ñslidesð down skewed surfaces
to remain at the deepest point. Yes, you guessed right, this way, the snow
starts to fill all gaps and slowly pile up until it covers the whole screen.
All through the demo, a stylish "ñtð" that also seems to be out of border,
in a coloured circle, is being displayed in the left part of the upper
screen. Additionally, a remix of a christmas song by óRhinoð is being
played.

Why don't i know wether the scroller is out of border and where the t is ?
Simple. The demo refuses to run on the Falcon as the ñJAMð-Packer they
used doesn't like the 68030. If you turn off all 680x0-caches by for
example using backward, the demo runs a little, but the timing is totally
corrupt on VGA so i óassumeð that the demo features out-of-border graphics.
As it also doesn't run on a òTOS 2.05 MegaSTEð, i had to view it on my
trusty old 1040 STE on a TV set and it's a bit hard to see wether something
is out of border on this TV set or not.
And that are already the negative sides of the intro. If you have a Falcon,
you won't be able to view this demo - Okay, if it really features out of
border graphics, i can understand it. But why doesn't it run on TOS 2.05 ?
The demo simply hangs up with a black-screen with the floppy light on.
Weird.
If you managed to get it to run, it's definetly worth a look. The snow falls
a bit straightforward, but smoothly and flawless and the piling up of the
snow is really very well done. The graphics are not too hot but way better
than those of a certain competitor (guess who) and the music may be short,
but it's nice, too, as it is very original.
So, give Crimbo a chance, definetly worth a look, just leaves some
questions open. Like, why does it have to be JAM-packer ? Are the graphics
out of border or not ? Does the demo crash when the whole screen is filled
with snow ? And what the heck does Crimbo mean anyway ?
