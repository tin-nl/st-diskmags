   ñThisð article is made for people who don't know the ñmeaningð of the word 
ó"CREW"ð. But what is the meaning of "crew" ? But everyone says what means crew 
? The only thing I know about a crew is that the word has 2 ñsidesð, the ófirstð 
is to have fun with all collaborators and the ósecondð is the work inside and 
outside this one . 

   Begin with the mean who say about work inside and outside a crew . I'm sure 
many people think like me and I think that for this reason a crew is not very 
important, just have many relations with people of the scene and just work 
together guys :-) I'm sure this situation isn't bad and anyone can do òmoreð 
things than a crew who hasn't the motivation ...

   Now if you are in a crew nobody prevents you from working with a poor guy 
without a crew except if there an incompatibility beetween guys :-) So this 
meaning wants to say in any case : DO IT and don't change your mind at the last 
moment .... or nobody won't to work with ñyouð. 

   Ha the second explanation :-) óJust have funð ! Yes within a crew it is the 
main thing :-) Working with these great people and laughing of everything that 
you do (buggy code or laughing at music etc... ) The atmosphere in a crew is 
very great (if you choose the good ñmembersð :-) ) but I know as people read 
this now that they understand what I want to say trough these words :-)


   ñAs a conclusionð  a crew isn't indispensable to survive in this world of 
cruelty and animosity :-))) Just have fun and as a great demo reads just 

    ó<< DO THINGS >>ð !!!! :-)
