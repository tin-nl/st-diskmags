               ò             It's GFX time again! 
             
  A bit strange.. the gfxman can use any number of colours he/she wants, any 
  resolution, any painting technique or tool. Huh? Well read the rules below, 
  it's not without limitations ;-)  

ñ                  Rules for the 3k GFX compo
                  
                  Any number of colours can be used 
                  Any resolution is allowed (though within normal screensize is 
                  recomended so everyone can watch the picture, and thus give 
                  the picture a better chance of getting voted for). 
                  JPEG, GIF, PNG and PC1 fileformats are allowed. 
                  Any technique is allowed (scanning, 3d software, pixeling, 
                  filtering..)  
                  The picture MUST be original work including the motive. 
                  Maximum filesize is: 3072 bytes (3kb). 

            Think you can handle this? Well then get on painting! 
       DEADLINE for delivering pictures to this compo is 18.00 CET on  
                           Sunday, January 30 2000.
