ñSNDPlayer 1.2ğ by òAssem-Softğ and òDHSğ [óAny Atariğ] (1999)


Whoa. Those swedes are ñfast!!ğ :-)
Even though Evil and Ozk themselves couldn't reproduce the bugs Candyman
and i had to report about òSNDPlayer 1.1ğ, they found the bug in less than
a week.
Like i already assumed the whole memory management has somehow gotten
corrupted, screwing up òGEMğ and òTOSğ really good in some way.
But after all, it seemed to turn out to be a òTOS 4.0xğ bug rather than
a programming error. Hard to tell in the end, but now, òSNDPlayer 1.2ğ
is available along with a set of new tunes to play within.

Like said in the ñSNDPlayer 1.1ğ review, òSNDPlayer 1.2ğ plays almost
anything from óTaoğ or the currently very popular ñSidSound-Designerğ-
tunes. The package available called ñDec_99ğ contains quite a lot of
files with tunes from óTao, DMA Sc, 505, MC Laserğ and even by other
people like óViking, D-Force, Baggioğ and óHavocğ.

To put it in a nutshell, òSNDPlayer 1.2ğ does its job excellently. No
timing problems, no matter what Atari at what speed you run in what
resolution on what monitor, no synchronisation problems, no replay
problems - òSNDPlayer 1.2ğ plays its tunes almost anywhere anytime.
Additionally, it has now been improved for òSingleTOSğ to run as an
óAccessoryğ that doesn't automatically open a window right after the
boot-sequence.
ñMiNT, MagiC, N.AESğ and ñGenevağ-users can of course run it as a simple
desktop program using drag & drop.
The only shadow that falls on this great program is the fact that it
still isn't capable of reserving memory so if you run it as an accessory
under òSingleTOSğ, loading a new "foreground" program will immediatelly
terminate replay. But i understand the problem and see currently no
solution for that myself so i guess òSingleTOSğ-users (Hello Thomas ! :-)
will have to arrange with that.

òSNDPlayer 1.2ğ is what ñeveryğ Atari user needs on his desktop to enjoy
a bunch of really great tunes during everday's work, coding or painting !

Thanks a lot to óozkğ and óEvilğ for putting it together !
