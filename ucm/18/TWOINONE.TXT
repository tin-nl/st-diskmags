ñTwo in Oneð by òDead Hackers Societyð (a DHS Xmas-compo release)
                           [óSTð] (1999)

Torn between old-school fanatics and people that demand stylish
new-school effects one only has the choice to migrate to writing
printer daemons for Solaris or simply combine the two viewpoints
of demo-writing.
òEvilð and òBellmanð decided to ñnotð write printer daemons for
Solaris and release an intro named òTwo in Oneð for their own compo.

Right after startup, a ñwireframe 3D objectð that looks like 2 pyramids
connected by their tops to each eath other move and rotate around the
screen while some text appears saying "óSome like the old styleð"
The screen fades to black, displaying a small ñmotionblurred tunnelð in
a relatively low resolution afterwards while some text appears saying
"óSome prefer the new styleð". After a short while, the ñwireframeð
pyramid reappears and the text is being replaced by "óWe like them both
and give youð".

Wait some more and a nice ñcartoon graphicð displaying Santa with a few
reindeers in a bar where the reindeers obviously refuse to work for Santa
behind a large ñTwo in Oneð logo appears on screen.
With a flash of light, the graphic turns to a ñmosaicð, being ñbumpmappedð
with òEvilð's very own "motionblurred" bumpmapper.
Bye bye bumpmapped Santa, here comes some more old-school effects. The
screen turns black as several objects made out of ñbobsð (i assume)
of 3 colours appear on screen: For example a óDHS-logoð or a óstarð.
The bobs never move out of screen, the objects are rather ñsquashedð
on the border of the screen.

After displaying those objects, something called a ñVortexð appears.
Or it is only the basic of a ñvortexð that is being displayed with some
interpolation effect. Hard to describe as it is being ñmotionblurredð
again, then moved and then the viewer gets totally lost. Definetly a 
newschool effect.

That calls for revenge of the old-school fanatics, right ? Here it comes.
A rather simple ñDHSð logo with a few stars around it appears in the upper
part of the screen while below, some more ñwireframe 3D objectsð are being
displayed. This time ñmotionblurredð in a way that at points, where several
lines cross, the object appears brighter. The objects move the way the
bobs did, meaning, they never move off screen but are ñsquashedð on the
border. You'll see an ñ68kð logo as well as some funky ñdiamondð like
object.

Time to say good bye. A nice and slick ñ3D dot tunnelð appears with a 
ñone bitplane vertical scrollerð over it, naming ñcredits and greetingsð.
All this is being supported by a ñSidSoundð-tune by òDMA Scð of óSector 
Oneð.

ñTwo in Oneð it says but it is rather ñTwo halfs of oneð as it is a little
short - though longer and longer-lasting than the other entries of this
compo. The music by òDMA Scð is superb. Although a little short, it is
the best tune i heard from him in a while.
Graphics are the weakest part of the demo. The nice title-picture with
ñSanta and the reindeers in the barð is well done for a ñ16 colour scanð,
but most of the other graphics, like the ñDHS-logoð or the ñ1 bpl fontð
of the final scroller are not very hot.

The effects presented are not all new but well presented and fit nice
into each other. And besides, who expected new killer-effects in a demo
like this - after all, it is mainly thought as a ñchristmas demoð.

The intro is a good one. Flawless, runs on all systems very much alike,
features some excellent music and nice effects. Well done.
