    Hum as always working on UCM just before it is released is a long and boring 
task but it's mine and I assume  the consequences... So what  stupid thing did I 
say or do in the previous issue ??

Ú    * Credits confusion
    
    That's the one i'm most ashamed of :( I gave credit to Spiny / Torment for 
the shell gfx while it should  have been  credited to ÛThe Berserker / Teenage. 
That sort of shit happens  when you receive too many files at once :( I should 
buy more ram for my brain.... sorry beerboy.

Ú    * Wrong Shell
    
    No reason to feel less ashamed  with this one  actually. Earx had sent me a 
fixed shell to have  UCM run  on rgb monitors  but I used  the wrong one... The 
explanation comes both from the amount of work required by the putting together 
of UCM and also the  number of shells  that are  stacked up onto my HD :) don't 
worry I've cleaned it up and only  two are left (because I  heard the fixed one 
doesn't like intros  much). Hopefully  I won't  forget to test this issue on my 
Falcon before releasing it, cross fingers fellows :)

Ú    * Personal Business
    
    I was told there was  too many of  my personal views in the news section and 
all through the magazine and I cannot but agree to  this statement. I won't look 
for excuses, that happens when someone has to write too many articles on his own 
and it's worse when the main editor is in a terrible mood. I apologize because I 
don't want you to pay for  what other people may  have done. I'll try to keep my 
problems out of view next time.

Û    * What else ?
    
    Dunno actually but don't you think it's not enough ? :)
