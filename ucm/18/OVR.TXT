ò INTERVIEW WITH:   BEN AND JESS [THE MILLENIUM BROTHERS]   FROM THE OVERLANDERS

ò================================================================================

óFoot by Foot...  Inch by Inch...  the millenium comes closer and closer and so I
óthink the  time is right to  force the brothers of the millenium to answer  some
ónicely written  questions  by a little  curious enthusiastic  freak who  wonders
óhimself how many of the old school sceners come back to life near the year 2000.




ñ[TalKshoW]ð

òMCL:       Hi Ben and Jess, how are you guys? (...don't worry, I won't ask
ò           you what colour your underpants have... ;-)

óBeN:       Hum !!! currently I am in a rush.. It is 2:00 am, I am at work to 
ó           finish a demo of a game ... I am very tired,, I badly sleep 4 hours
ó           by night and I spend all my time at work !!! That's coders life !

ñJESS:      I don't even know who am I, how could I tell others ? Indeed, the
ñ           eldest thing I remember is this dark night where, dressed in a ninja
ñ           costume, I escaped from the lunatic asylum. I can't remember before.
ñ           This is to say that I'm someone who does not believe in any god. I
ñ           only believe in me. And this is also to say I'm a bit lunatic too,
ñ           that's true. My mind is full of regrets for a past time where 
ñ           computing was 100% for fun and 0% for business, whereas nowadays,
ñ           it seems to be more and more the contrary.



òMCL:       Now for the usual bits please tell us about your history. How did
ò           you start computing and when did you join OVR and all the stuff :-)

óBeN:       I discover Demo coding, with a crack intro from DOM of the 
ó           replicants. It was the one for the game Barbarian II (a vertival
ó           scroll, 3 "zooming" sound-meter balls and a scrolltext pulled by
ó           ghosts .. Remember ? ). I decided that demo coding was it ! I knew
ó           only basic, and began to try to code a screen in GFA... When I got
ó           "The Union Demo", I understood that only assembler can help me...
ó           Then came "Undead" time. I created it with good Friends. My AKA was
ó           "Orcus". The only screen done and released by Undead, won the 
ó           transbeauce II demo contest, with one of the first "Amiga dentro"
ó           style demo with some new FX (vertical rasters & original flat 3d).
ó           Just after the transbeauce II party, started to work on my first
ó           soundchip player, becoz I think it was a shame to have a very good
ó           musician at home, and don't make the best of him !!! It was something
ó           new to me, and I learn lotsa things during all the time I have 
ó           developped ST sound chip players.

ñJESS:      As many of you I guess, I first started to play with a C64 
ñ           (marvellous machine), then we got a 1040 STF. Later, we've heard 
ñ           about demo making and I joined the Undead demo group, with my 
ñ           "Ninja Turtle" pseudo. As my brother started to work on the first
ñ           soundchip player release, I began to compose with it, under GenST
ñ          editor (I've never had any GUI to compose my chiptunes). Some of
ñ           my first productions have fallen in the ears of Doclands, a great
ñ           composer from Overlanders. I met him, and he proposed me and my 
ñ           brother to join the famous OVR team, interested in our job. OVR,
ñ           at the time, was already a huge group and the ratio musicians/coders
ñ           was very small... Then I choosed to change my pseudo to "Jess". And
ñ           you know the rest of the story, hu ?



òMCL:       What I ever wanted to ask: why did you guys call yourself the
ò           Millenium Brothers? You choosed this name long before the hype
ò           about the millenium began, so please tell us.

ñJESS:      Yeah, an easy question! well, firstly, Ben and I are bros. Secondly,
ñ           "Millenium" comes from the name of the most famous spaceship in all
ñ           the Universe, guess which ?.... I mean the "Millenium Falcon" of
ñ           course, piloted by Han Solo and Chewbacca in the StarWars trilogy.
ñ           I'm one more addict of these movies. And the soundtrack is so lovely!
ñ           So how could I stay unsensitive ?... The fact we are so close to a
ñ           new millenium is a coincidence. I, personaly, do not care much about
ñ           all that noise made around Y2K... unless it sounds the time of the ST
ñ           revival !!

óBeN:       Nothing to add.



òMCL:       It seems that you both are the only surviving bastion of the 
ò           legendary, and in the end enormously huge, OVERLANDERS from the
ò           UNION. What has happened to all the other guys after the 'Froggies
ò           over the Fence' demo was released? 

ñJESS:      'The Froggies over the Fence' mega demo met a so good success in
ñ           the worldwide ST scene that the whole OVR team decided it was the
ñ           best moment to terminate properly the adventure there. Then we 
ñ           organize a great private suicide party to disappear from the Earth
ñ           surface. Everybody from the Overlanders crew passed away, except
ñ           two of us, namely, the Millenium Brothers. Why ? Because, somewhere,
ñ           we both still are former members of the 'Undead' group, so we can't
ñ           die !!!! Well, just kiddin'. In fact, since that time (the Froggies
ñ           release), a few of us has been keeping in touch, like a sort of hard
ñ           core made of crazy guys (like Ben and I, Mister Bee, Dim, and Ziggy 
ñ           Stardust...) and for whom ST has and will never completely die. They
ñ           also came along with others nice guys like Dtx Synchron and Fury 
ñ           (Legacy), Jalden, Kas and Sweep (Undead)....sorry for the missing 
ñ           ones. We did not produce anymore demos, but the spirit was and is 
ñ           still there, at least I believe in it.

óBeN:       Well, I think OVR was done before Froggies Over the Fence release.
ó           In fact, this demo was release by a hard work the DTX-synchron. All
ó           the other (except may Mr.Bee) already stopped ST programming, 
ó           probably becoz the Falcon was a new machine for new people ...



òMCL:       Do you still have contact to all the guys from OVR or other groups
ò           from the UNION nowadays?
           
óBeN:       Well some of them are very good friends and I keep in touch with
ó           them. Most of the time there is nothing to do with computer.

ñJESS:      I think I've more or less answered this question previously, but
ñ           in a nutshell, yes, from time to time we meet guys from Legacy,
ñ           Undead, ST CNX, Oxygene...and many others,  and I would even add 
ñ           that, personaly, I also stay in contact with guys from the Amiga
ñ           scene (especially some nice muzixx composers... of course) like
ñ           Monty from Analog.



òMCL:       Ben, your last coding appearance was in the NOSTALGIC demo project
ò           from Leonard/OXYGENE. It featured a brilliant and technical really
ò           up-to-date screen. Why took it so long to code something like that
ò           again? I mean wasn't that fun? [hint! hint!]
           
óBeN:       Well in fact, it takes me very long time to release it !! But 
ó           effectiv time passed to program it was not so long ... What took me
ó           many time was to build tools like development enviroment, bitmap
ó           convertor, geometry convertor and to jump from platform to another 
ó           (genST, genPC (dos assembler made by Ziggy + my ST debugger, genST
ó           ( I sold my PC !! ), RiscPC(excellent development platform ...). I
ó           have only work on it from time to time, when I want to change my mind
ó           or to make a return to roots. I spend some hard time to finish the
ó           screen for the Nostalgic demo. And I finally finish it with my 4mb
ó           STE with a single floppy drive !!!



òMCL:       Jess, I have heard your latest musical efforts and I wonder which
ò           company you are working for. I think you are skilled enough to earn
ò           money with doing music. Do you earn money with it? ..and if not
ò           what are you doing in your job.
           
ñJESS:      Thanks for your compliments, MC Laser, and I really think that some 
ñ           others ST soundchip composers deserve such congratulations. 
ñ           Unfortunately, I do not earn money with muzixx. I work in Software
ñ           Industry (who don't, nowadays ?) as a consultant, and the only things
ñ           I sell are stupid advises to customers I visit... but, nevertheless,
ñ           I'm still very interested in having a job dealing with muzixx. I've
ñ           even been in contact with some famous labels, a while ago, which were
ñ           interested in some productions of mine composed in my home studio (in
ñ           parallal with St SoundChip compositions, I practiced Cubase on my
ñ           Atari...). But, for some various reasons, I could'nt get a serious
ñ           contract proposition. I'm also close to videogames world, for which
ñ           I'd still like to propose my contribution. Well, in fact, many 
ñ           possibilities are still opened, and one day or the other, I might
ñ           choose a real opportunity. Coz' muzixx is all my life, whatever shape
ñ           it takes, from the invisible sound chip plugged on a sound board, to
ñ           the ancestral wood and tubular instrument called didgeridoo...



òMCL:       Ben, please tell our readers about your current project and why 
ò           you have thought that it's necessary to do this. 
           
óBeN:       Well. I think you are talking about SC68. It is my ST sound chip
ó           emulator. I did it from scratch, becoz Leonard's one (ST sound)
ó           can't play correctly some of Jess best tunes ( Zehit, Wave is my
ó           passion ... ) just becoz it doesn't features some of the special FX
ó           I program in my players. and becoz I hate Windows !! In the contrary
ó           of ST-sound, SC68 is a 68K emulator, with some ST io plugged (YM2149,
ó           MicroWire (STE) , Shifter (only for 50/60/70 hz detection), MFP 
ó           (timerA,B,C,D in timer mode) ) I decided to add a Paula (Old Amiga
ó           sound chip) emulation becoz it takes me very little time to do it.
ó           Today I have a Linux, a BeOs, a Windows :( and a RiscOS version of 
ó           SC68. Release will come very soon but I don't have many time for my
ó           personal project , and building music database is a very hard work...



òMCL:       Are there any unreleased atari projects lying around on some of your
ò           harddrives that we can expect to see sometime? Or are you planning
ò           to do something on the atari again?
           
óBEN:       I always have ideas of things to do with a single 520STF ... But time
ó           is missing.

ñJESS:      Who knows ? I could ship some brand new tracks based upon the latest
ñ           soundchip player from my brother, which has not yet been honored... 
ñ           This is a question of... competition !! I so much regret the time of
ñ           muzixx constests we used to participate in during coding parties... 
ñ           (and also, gimme a new atari mouse, I don't have one working anymore
ñ           and I'm tired playing with the shift/arrows keys !)



òMCL:       Jess, how many tunes have you composed on ST and how many tunes
ò           in general (includes mods and mp3's as well)?

ñJESS:      About 50 ST tunes, which is not much compared to some others guys,
ñ           but my tracks are often longer (noticed that ?) than average... 
ñ           Haven't you ever been bored ? ha ha ha !. Much harder to count my
ñ           modules : a lot of them where unachieved. Some were produced for
ñ           video games that have never seen the daylight. Some were made with
ñ           Extreme Tracker for Gravis Ultrasound only and this format seem to
ñ           have disappeared... well, finally, I would say about 50 as well. I've
ñ           also composed many pieces of muzixx within my home studio, among
ñ           which very few were converted to mp3. I really love synthesizers : 
ñ           it's my favorite hobby (scoop !). By the way, I'll do my best to 
ñ           spread some of them via the web (I'm currently workin' on my personal
ñ           web site. (scoop 2 !!)). So, a dozen of 'serious' tracks were made
ñ           with Cubase, plus one or two compositions made in 'partnership' with
ñ           Monty from Analog.

óBeN:       From my personal soundchip data base I could tell you that Jess wrote
ó           54 ST tunes with a total playing time of 9 hours 27' 02" ... That's 
ó           part of information stored in SC68 database :)



òMCL:       Ben, when it comes to democoding... who made the most important
ò           steps on the atari-scene in your eyes and who is the most skilled
ò           coder around?

óBeN:       Not very original but Nic was if not the best, the first coder
ó           around. But DIM made some very good things ( his plasma and his 
ó           zoomer are incredible ). There was many important steps in demo 
ó           coding in many ways. Teknically fullscreen was in my feeling the
ó           most important step, then come sync-scrolling. Later, the last
ó           incredible hard ware trick was Alien's 4 pixel sync scrolling in the
ó           Punish your Machine.



òMCL:       The best data from the RAM of your memory about the life in the
ò           atari scene was? (best party, demo...)
           
óBEN:       My fisrt party the Transbeauce II, and "Undead" Froggies private
ó           parties with ST conexion, M-coder, OVR, Naos..   

ñJESS:      Just let me run my sort-algorithm to find out the best...  here it
ñ           is ! hum... good old 68000 routines. I remember a demo party where
ñ           has been organized a soundchip contest. The organizator of the party
ñ           knew I would surely participate it, as usual. Then, in the first day,
ñ           he came to me and, very sincerily, told me the funny thing ever: "Hi
ñ           Jess, happy to meet you, I supposed you'll challenge the constest,
ñ           don't you ? cooool... But watch out, I've been told that Ninja Turtle
ñ           was also there, he might make life difficult for you and winning the
ñ           constest won't be that easy !". The nice guy simply ignored that Jess
ñ           and Ninja Turtle were nothing but the same person !!



òMCL:       What are your hobbies besides computing?

óBeN:       Doing sport and party time.

ñJESS:      Muzixx (hearing, playing, composing, synthesizing), Sport (climbing,
ñ           martial arts), Finance, Live Mixing (like DJ's), Didgeridoo, running
ñ           ST demos !



òMCL:       Another usual one for the end. What's your current equipment?

óBeN:       After my Acorm RPC crash, I couldn't find another "sexy" machine ...
ó           So I get the cheapest : a PC :( Celeron 366 , 128mb , TNT and all
ó           bullshit ):. Running under BeOS and Linux ... Winners use no Windows
ó           shit .. Never !!!

ñJESS:      I couldn't enumerate all the equipment sleeping in my cellar (C64,
ñ           ST, old PCs,...), but my home studio is presently made of a fucking
ñ           PC, a great synthesizer (K2000), a drum machine (Boss dr660), a 
ñ           mixing console (Mackie), an amp (Marantz), 2 speakers (Bose), an
ñ           electric guitar (fake Fender), 2 didgeridoos, and various other
ñ           weird stuffs...
