{*f1 BE POSITIVE !{*f0

Before we continue the critical saga, I just want to say one thing, the review 
of  something is  important  for all  things, so, there are  too many negative 
reviews and not enougth positive .... so, now, after saying many critical words 
about Ucm 16, I continue to say what I think as my words are positive .


  I am not going to speak of the intro, because I participated to it (thanks a 
lot Frost)..... but I can say the musics are gigantic !!! Well done TAO and MC 
Laser ! and I prefer these ones to the last ucm :) ( it's a personal point of 
vue). And the environment then ? It is merrier than the previous one, less 
"underground" :-). I found the gfx of The Berserker/Teenage plus Spiny/Torment  
are pleasant, well done :)(it's always a personal point of view :-) 

  Now, time for the bad words about this edition ... Where are the articles ??? 
Where ??? I don't know but  maybe nobody knows .... maybe little green men are 
coming on the earth but I'm not sure ...  :-)  Shame on everybody....

  So St_Survivor, I would sooner see more articles but I'm sure you too .... 

     Cheers,
