ñSpice Boys XXXmasñ by òSpice Boysð [DHS Xmas diner release] (óFalconð)

{*i spicexms.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

It's that time of the year again, where it gets so extremely cold in
sweden that one can stand it only locked up with a few other swedes
totally drunk. 
And what excuse could be better for getting drunk than having a nice
cosy christmas dinner with the òDHS, Mind Design, Wildfireð and god knows
what other fellows.

Okay, i am overdoing it a little.
Let's put it this way: It's that time of the year where you prefer to
spend your time inside instead of outside in sweden and meet some friendly
people from òDHS, Mind Design, Wildfireð and probably even other groups
inside to have some nice, christmassy dinner together and maybe a beer or
two.
And why not. After all, the òSpice Boysð, this time consisting of òAssnð,
òDaazð and òbagarnð, released a small intro for the ST to tell all the
others that they enjoyed their dinner.
The demo starts with some not-so-bad graphics and some less-good-graphics
while some ñSidSound-musicð starts to play. You are then presented a very
ugly òSpice Boys XXXmasð-logo, followed by a picture of the three òSpice
òBoysð in colour, which soon fades down to greyscaled to make room for a
single-coloured pseudo-sinwave moving scroller.
The text is about òdaazð in search of a mate, some 68k assembly code,
some nonsense about òbagarnð's music and some other nonsense.

Hmmm ... So what do i think about this ?
I think that this is not so bad after all. It surely is no demo based on
variational and funky effects, but what's wrong with just sitting together
and fix an intro like this at an event like a christmas-dinner ? The 
scroller is pure nonsense, the photo is nice, but nothing to get wild about,
the best aspect about this demo is without a doubt òbagarnð's music although 
it isn't very long-lasting either.
A simple intro that fullfills its job though: Say hello in a freaky, swedish
way during wintertime ... And have a nice Christmas, everyone.
