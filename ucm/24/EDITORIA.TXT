And now for something completely different...

Meuh! Eh? What? When you browsed  through the contents  you may have checked out
that nothing of  the announced things  are included. The  reason is  as clear as
simple... I didn't had any "Bock drauf" after  I didn't matched the Xmas release
or the  Error In Line release... Over weeks  I had no  ideas and  real plans and
over all no motivation to work out  some huge projects and to realize some of my
ideas expressed in the last issue. Since  this time I changed  my mind a lot and
today I'm standing  on a point where I  don't accept  pressure anymore for doing
UCM. If it is ready, then it is cool, if not... who really cares?!

And so you surely will miss some of the following things...

- the Lamertest... but believe  me, it  is still  cooking in my mind and I got a
  a few nice questions supplied...
- the Godpey test... arg! I  broke my promise! Shame on me! But believe me, I've
  so many  other things  in mind, esp since "Superfly" was  released, that I did
  not got my hands on that game  anymore... Maybe it  will return in a review as
  golden oldie in a few years?! ;)
- Where are they now part  3... Somehow  I lost  my motivation for that project.
  The current  issue  was  created over  many months, here  and article, then an
  article... over weeks no article at all... For such projects you must be a bit
  more steady working on the mag... and I didn't...
- Where is  the  announced Dune special?! You  dumb lame  moondog, you made some
  empty promises again... yes... :(  But  things  went  wrong, I lost contact to
  Chuck over Xmas (as this issue was planned to be released at first) and then I
  lost my focuse on this theme... The little  stuff I worked  on is still laying
  here on my harddisk but I  don't see  a real good  way to work it out to a big
  story or something else...

Damn... moondog is a lamer...

And if writing articles is growing up to a pain in the ass it is time to stop...
and since I don't want to  stop today, I just  took the times  for breaks, doing
things I wanted  to do apart  from computing, or  just laming  around for  a few
days, playing a dumb game  or laying just  for hours in the sun, thinking "Baah,
old Atari, lick my ass..."

And why you can read a new UCM right now?! Because I just had found a little bit
motivation to work on  it over the past  days, I had some  time as well and so I
did, the things that came in my mind right now and not the stuff I planned to do
over a half year ago... and overall... I have  red that ALIVE 7 will be released
quite soon... Arg! Two  Alive issues reviewed in one UCM... That can't be and so
I tormented my self for hours and hours... The result is right presented on your
screen...

Sure, after the dumb poll idea that just expressed  the lazyness of big parts of
the scene, that doesn't really care about such things, I was dragged down a lot,
as the sheets dripped in only very slow and  very seldom, but a thing  that woke
up my mind was the fact that the  UCM packeges  were downloaded  several hundred
times in the first weeks and  that showed me in the end that there is still some
interest, but the  little Atarians just seemed to be too shy to get in touch for
just a dumb poll sheet or for feedback or even to help out in developing another
issue... And so time and motivation passed by, came back, passed again...

Somehow the Error In Line and the slowly released competition stuff brought back
my motivation, esp. as I could check  out the stuff on my machines and I finally
had something to review again (yeah!). Anyway, the current issue is surely a bit
smaller but if you take a look into the credits, you see why...

I wont  mourn  around about  missing support  again, as this has  filled so many
editorials  and bulletin boards  sites that it  is going to be just wasted time.
I just want to say that the smaller contents  are a direct result of the missing
support and  that I don't wanted to  wait and collect more stuff to bring a full
blown issue. Therefore I decided to include  as many screenshots  as possible to
colour up the situation a  little bit ;) So  the split of the mag into light and
full version again isn't a result of the screenshots, but of the very big module
that was used this time...

So don't wonder about the "fast" read... I for myself  will enjoy the summer and
wont care about another issue over the next weeks... off for a little break...

                                                                  yours, moondog
                                                                        26.o6.o3
