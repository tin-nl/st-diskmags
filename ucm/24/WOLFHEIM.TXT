                 In concert - WOLFSHEIM, 3o.o4.o3 - Erfurt/Germany
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wolfsheim, one  of the  best synth-pop-bands  around, started  another  tour for
their latest album called "Casting Shadows" (see review under the link below)...

ñ---> Casting Shadows <---                                                           {*\CASTING.TXT}

...that was released in early spring and matched it to place its first single at
the media control charts top ten at the first try and is, still, played in heavy
rotation on many mainstream radio stations.

As I got the information that  they will stop with  their tour in  Erfurt it was
clear for me, I must go there and so I droved to Jena to get the tickets, as the
concert date was confirmed (they moved several dates of the tour in early spring
and so the concert  date in Erfurt, too. The  tickets were  with nearly 21 Euros
not too expensive (remember Depeche Mode with over 4o Euros?!).

On the evening  of the 3o.o4. we droved  to Erfurt and got quite crazy as we did
not  found the concert  hall, the "Thringenhalle" at  the  first  and also  not
at the second try. We droved  through the whole city for over one half  hour and
the time where the concert should start was coming closer and closer. In the end
we stumbled over the place because of an incident and entered together with many
hundred people the hall.

The hall was  quite big and dark, I think  there was room for two/three thousand
people maybe or even  more, but in the end it  wasn't filled completely that was
not that bad as the air was hot and  sticky and I felt like I had taken a shower
with my clothes after 1o minutes.

We matched it to get  a place about 1o - 15 meters apart from the stage and then
waited for the show. It didn't took too  long and the first  sounds of "In Time"
from the latest albums' instrumental  track were coming  out of the boxes. Hu? I
started to wonder as there seems to  be no support act. So who was the announced
"special guest" on the ticket then?! Hmmm... we will see.

The lights were  turned down and  Peter Heppner and Markus Reinhardt entered the
stage. The masses screamed loudly and they didn't waited too long and started to
perform their gig without bigger small talk.

Of course  they played  mainly new  material, such as -all- tracks  from the new
album, that offered a bit  changed sound as they included guitars stuff and then
showed the special  guests. After  some  tracks two  more musicians  entered the
stage while  they played the song "I wont believe" that ends up quite rocking on
the album. And so it did at  the concert. The guys on  the guitar  and the drums
matched it to bring the rocking feeling from the CD into the hall as well...

This was quite cool but seems to suck off some "old school fans" that started to
shout "Fuck you" and  stuff like that... dumb  assholes they are... But the main
part of  the audience liked  it very much, started  to sing  along with  several
songs like (the  nearly played  to death) "Kein Zurck" and "Knstliche Welten",
that was presented in a quite new sound, as well as some other classics.

But the crowd got mad finally as they played their top classic "The Sparrows And
The Nightingales" together  with some  glittering fireworks, wow... what  a cool
effect! Btw... the show wasn't  that a big  medial event, they  used mainly only
the lightshow, only a few special effects but, all looked quite good anyway and,
overall, the special effects weren't  not used to overpaint low passages as some
other bands are using them for.

The show  lasted quite  long for a  synth-pop-concert, so they  played nearly 9o
minutes, as said all the stuff from the last album as well as several songs from
"Spectators". The crowd matched it to get  them back for  two encores  and there
they played a  real classic again, "Annie" that  was soaked  off by the audience
like nearly no other song before.

So what? Another encore wasn't given and  the light was turned  on after a while
and we left  the building, with  very wet clothes because  of the temperature in
the hall, while outside the  rain was pooring down, best weather to catch a flu,
hehehe...

After all, cool concert, cool atmosphere, nice interepretations of old songs and
only  very few assholes  that are  still living  yesterday and  don't accept the
musical movement of a band... If I get the  chance to  go to another  concert of
Wolfsheim, I will always try to make it true, you should do so as well...
