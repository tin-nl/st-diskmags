                              DBUG MENU # 172
ó-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

system... Atari ST/STe, RGB

ó-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñDBUGð menu 172  was released on 13/10/2oo2  -  only  about six weeks after "they"
published  menu 171.  Wow, this was  pretty fast! But hey,  let's  keep the pro-
portions: ñDBUGð didn't release any menus since 8 years before that. ;)

When I started it for the first time,  I was  pretty confused  because the intro
says  this  is  ñAUTOMATION CD 153ð,  containing  the  games óZOMBIEð,  óPIRATESð  and
óBATTLESHIPSð.

Hmm,  what's wrong here?  Did ñDBUGð really  mix up the two intros? Well, I really
thought so and quitted the intro before anything happened. Some moments later, I
asked the  people on  ó#atariscneð what's  wrong with  this menu  and they  said I
should take some  time and  watch  the  intro  carefully.  It's great irc is not
using any webcam,  cause  I am sure some couldn't  hide their laughter... Do you
need any more prove about me being a pure lamer?! ;)

So I started the disk once more  and took a closer  look to it.  The intro shows
the rear  view  of a  sports-car with  smoking tyres.  Not very impressing, only
pure nostalgy,  as such pictures were very  trendy about 15 years ago. The music
is  by  ñDavid  Whittakerð  and  far  too  oldskoolish.  Two  32x32  pixel-raster-
scrollers are shown in the upper and lower border, giving credits and greetings.
The colors used there - green on red and grey/blue on violet -  makes everything
clear:

                         óWelcome back to the 1980's!ð

The  decent menu-collector must have realized it: ñAUTOMATION Menu 153ð  never had
scrollers! (I doubt anyone understood this insider-gag of ñDBUGð, but who cares ;)
So all of a sudden, the music stops, the number of the CD, which is displayed on
the number plate of the car is increased to 172 and the ñAUTOMATIONð logo  changes
to ñDBUGð.  And so  does the  display of the content of the disk. The ñDBUGð logo is
nothing much to mention. Red-metallic 80's style again, lots  of straight lines.
At least  the  music  changed  to  something  very  nice,  it's  called óAPEXð  by
ñFRAZER/TSCð.

Anyway,  let's come to  the things that  should be most interesting when talking
about  menu-disks:  the content!  ñDBUGð  menu 172 contains óZOMBIE+ð, óHUMEUR VITREEð
ó(FILED)ð and DOCS for óZOMBIE+ð.

óZOMBIE+ð is  an  adventure  by  ñUBI Softwareð. It was supplied by ñSKINHEAD/ICSð and
packed+trained  by  ñSHOWADDYWADDY/DBUGð.  You  have to  handle four persons  with
different abilities.  The  whole  game is displayed in  first-person-view, using
mediocre graphics,  some samples and a  ñWhittackerð-music  that will get  on your
nerves after only a short time. In fact I don't  know what the game is all about
and I have to admit that I also don't want to, as it looks far too dull and old.

As a special  gimmick,  a savegame is supplied that was  saved right before  the
game is  completed.  You  only have to  do a  few  things to see the end of  the
game... And you better load it right at the beginning so  you won't  got hurt by
this crappy stuff.

I won't loose  much words about óHUMEUR VITREEð. It's a wellknown dentro by french
demomakers  ñHEMOROIRDSð, released back in 1994.  Nice design, nice effects, great
graphics by several artists, e.g. ñNIKO/MJJð. I think everyone already has it. The
version on  the ñDBUGð disk is filed,  but as the  original bootdisk runs on my ST
and even under emulators, I don't see much sense for this.  It's not more than a
disk-filler,  although it is a nice one.  Finally,  to  reveal a secret:  óHUMEURð
óVITREEð does  not  mean  "fun with glas" or  something like that.  It's  a french
medical expression, describing some liquid of the inner parts of  the eyes.  And
let's compare that name to ñNIKO'sð title-picture! Everything clear? ;)

He'd better used contact lenses...

Conclusion: From  our series "Compact menus  the world doesn't need", you saw...
ñDBUG Menu 172ð is not a must have,  although I guess everyone leeched it from the
net because  new stuff is so rare today. Before I deleted this cd,  I checked it
once out of curiosity and once more for this test. Personally,  I don't see much
sense in menu  disks with old stuff - exept for the maker to complete the row up
to menu 200...
