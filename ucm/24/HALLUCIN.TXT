ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the óReservoir Godsð have blown new life into some old scene corpses, they were
able to flood us with ST demo stuff at Error In Line 3 party and after the works
of ñDamoð (former óRedliteð) we  now  have the  possibilities  to check out  the new
adventures of ñGriffð (former óElectronic Imagesð) on Atari hardware. The name ñGriff
is moving through  the Atari scene like a red  line since many many years and so
it's time to check out what he has done now...

At first, "Hallucinations" runs only  on ST hardware or emulation, it refused to
run on my Falcon but since its a ST demo, this isn't a point to moan about.

The demo starts with a òvery abstract óReservoir Godsð logo and a òquite oldskoolish
chip  music  that reminds  me suddenly  to some  old ST demo  stuff, but  is new
composed by ñMSGð. The RG logo is  followed by a presents logo and  again followed
by a Hallucinations logo, showing also a little gouraud shaded vector pyramid.

The show goes on with òsome oldschool stuffð. So there is a big masked dots sphere
to see, followed  by a ball made of red line  vectors and finally  followed by a
vector "ball" with lightsourced  faces. òNot bad  but to say  the truth  not mind
òblowing as well.

The next part  is some  way always  the same. You get some  strange and slightly
animated grafix and those come along with several gouraud shaded vector objects.

òThe left one swings his bat!

The  grafix are  òin parts well  doneð and have a  very òown touchð, furthermore the
shown objects are getting  more and more  faces as  it seems. Unfortunately  the
changed  colours and  grafix cannot  hide the fact that  here was  òplayed around
òwith just one effect much too long.

At next  a òvery  oldschoolish raytracing  animationð comes  up, you remember that
thing  where a bunch of  raytraced balls  is diving into  water or something? It
looks nice but quite outdated  tough, just like some stuff we have seen 1o years
ago as first Falcon screens...

The next one is no chair knocker as well, òIFS fractalesð, showing green geometric
objects and later on the  known plants. I remember this kind of effect from some
old demos very well.

The show  more or less  ends up with  a little punisher, we  see a little vector
flying towards a little vector city, are following  the little vector and flying
around  a bit in  the city. òThat's  a nice effectð, I really  like it. It's quite
smooth and fast, not very detailed, but well done anyway.

òWhere is the little fighter?

Then a ònice  EIL 3 logoð by  ñC-Remð pops in and the  demo  ends with the usual end
scroller, bringing  a well known  Amiga tracker music  and the usual credits and
greetings. There seems to be no other way out as to reset the machine.

òfinal words... "HALLUCINATIONS" is a nice  little ST demo, but  over all no real
ò               ground  breaker. At  one hand  it shows  up that  some old coding
ò               wizards still know how to torture our beloved STs, but it suffers
ò               under some old failures too. So there are  some nice effects very
ò               consequently rode  to death (just like  the gouraud vectors) just
ò               to stretch the  demo a bit as well as  some parts  look like they
ò               were taken out of a 1o years old demo, so there is no real design
ò               and it looks a bit mixed up. A highlight for me is the 3D city at
ò               the end of the demo. The grafix all have a very strange touch and
ò               some of them  are quite  nice looking  while  others have  a much
ò               lower quality. The main music  is a nice old  schoolish thing, it
ò               reminds me to some old demo soundtracks but avoids real copies...
ò               The  end tune is  therefore a bit  unoriginal. So the  whole demo
ò               leaves a quite mixed impression at all.

The comeback of Griff suffers  a bit under strange collection of effects and the
mixed putting together. A bit more works may have helped to gain better results.
