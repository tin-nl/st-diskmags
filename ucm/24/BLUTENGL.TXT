ói put my fingers on your lips
óclose your eyes and feel my lust
óthere's a pain inside my kiss
ói'm only looking for your blood
ói'll show you what's the price
óso darling come with me this night
ówe've got to spread our wings and fly

ówe want to hold you in our arms
óand you can't resist our tenderness
ówe're so mysterious

ówe want to bite you we want your blood
óand you can't resist our bloody lips
ócome into our land

                          ó---------------------------
                       album released by SPV/Out of Line

Thanx to Scy I was able to check out this marvellous album on Error In Line 2k3.

To the ones  who don't know  BLUTENGEL (in  english  Bloodangel), this is a side
project by Chris Pohl, the man behind the electro  project TERMINAL CHOICE where
he lives  out his "softer" side and  so "Angel Dust" expresses  still electronic
music, but now  containing heavenly voices  as well and leaving  behind the very
apocalyptic  contents  and  touch of  the Terminal Choice  releases, in parts it
even reminds  a bit  to releases  by Silke Bischoff/18 Summers, but  using a bit
more electronics and more drive

"Angel Dust" brings us a real flood of songs, to be precise 16 songs with nearly
8o minutes were burned onto the album... So lets have a look at the contents...

o1 - Angel dust I
o2 - Stranded
o3 - Vampire romance part I
o4 - The end of love
o5 - Iron heart
o6 - Our time
o7 - Wonderland
o8 - Angel dust II
o9 - Black wedding
1o - I will follow
11 - Silent death
12 - Angel of the night
13 - Keine Ewigkeit
14 - Night of sin
15 - Vampire romance part II
16 - Angel dust III

In fact it's a bit senseless to speak  about every single  song here as they all
belong more or  less to  the same  genre. I especially  like  the ones  with the
female voices added to Chris' very good dark voice. Furthermore the  massive use
of synthesizer arrangements and noises make it very attractive...

Many songs have a real good  drive, sounding even in parts a bit like electro or
even synth pop some bands in this genre can't  do that much better and will fill
up the dancefloors of the dark clubs for sure...

Also the friends of slower  songs, synth/electro ballads will  find stuff on it,
esp. track 9 reminds me hard to some stuff by Silke Bischoff btw, really cool...
Esp people  that love the morbidity of the mentioned band will feel home at this
album as it  goes always  about the same  topic, love, dreams, pain and death...
and vampirism... hu? Yeah... cliches ahead :)

Two songs are  in german btw but that shouldn't be a drawback to lent one ear to
the album...

A thing that  surely will  attract some  people apart from the music is the very
bloody booklet, showing in parts erotic pictures that are a question of taste.
Obviously  they're  a bit  oriented on  the pictures  by  Felix Flaucher for the
Silke Bischoff collection, but to be honest without reaching their quality.
