                       Interview with Deez of EVOLUTION
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


UCM.... Hello Deez! This  interview isn't  tought to start  from scratch  as the
        usual ones, but tought to enlight the latest developments around you and
        your way to go in the next time... so how are you?

ÚDeez... Hi Moondog, I'm fine  thanks, a bit  stressed out at the moment, looking
Ú        for a new job. (was made redundant a few days ago)


UCM.... You've  teamed up now under the label -Evolution-, a new formed label in
        the Falcon scene. As far as I know Baggio is also on board. Can you tell
        us a bit  more  about the memberstate? Are there more people in this new
        team?

ÚDeez... Evolution  is: me, Baggio  and Zounds. Me and  Zounds do all  the coding
Ú        while Baggio is responsible for music and a new website.


UCM.... I guess -Mind Design- is  history now, isn't  it? What was the reason to
        build  up  a  completely  new  band? Has -Mind Design- reached  its  end
        somehow or  do you needed  to put an end under the way you were going so
        far?

ÚDeez... Viking  stopped all  his Atari projects  right after  Sillyventure2k and
Ú        sold his Falcon  to me two  years ago, I kept coding on my own but I was
Ú        never happy with  what I produced, it's very difficult to produce decent
Ú        demos without any help.
Ú        Viking promised me  music all the time but he never finished any. During
Ú        Mekka-Symposium  I asked  Baggio and Zounds (Wildfire) if they wanted to
Ú        start a new  project, to do something different. I think all three of us
Ú        were in a desperate need for inspiration so we decided to start all over
Ú        again from scratch.
Ú        As for Mind-Design  I still  have a thing  or two  to finish  off before
Ú        closing this chapter.


UCM.... What memories do you have on your times in -Mind Design-? Was it easy to
        skip this part of your scene history?

ÚDeez... Obviously  I have loads  of memories, me and Viking started in the early
Ú        90s on the ST but we never really released  anything, I still  have lots
Ú        of  sources, music  and   graphics  on  floppies  at  my  parents  place
Ú        somewhere, most of them are broken though so dont expect any retro stuff
Ú        from me!
Ú        The last thing  Mind-Design did  as a proper  team was Hardcore in 2000,
Ú        too bad  only a small part was released, we had big plans for that demo,
Ú        it was supposed to be our first really big production, but we  never had
Ú        the time  to put everything  together, the  music was cut down from four
Ú        minutes to  a minute and a  half or something the day before we left for
Ú        Sillyventure.


UCM.... As -Mind Design- was member of the Lunatic Asylum, and since  LOUD! does
        not seem to exist as demo band anymore, it seems as this little alliance
        is at its  end now, as only PARANOIA are left in it. Or will -Evolution-
        take over the place of -Mind Design-?

ÚDeez... I had a  chat with Paranoid  a while ago  about this and I think we both
Ú        agreed to end that "cooperation", it wasn't much of an alliance though.


UCM.... I heard  the rumour that  the label -Evolution- has something to do with
        the fact  that this  team was  founded to  create demos for CT6o Falcons
        only in the future, or why have you taken that name?

ÚDeez... The name hasn't  got anything  to do with  the CT60  at all, it's a good
Ú        name, thats  it. We spent  an hour or so on irc trying to come up with a
Ú        good name, the people on #atariswe came up with all sorts of weird names
Ú        for  us  but finally  Zounds  suggested  Evolution  and  after  a bit of
Ú        research on  the web to make sure it wasn't already taken we settled for
Ú        this.


UCM.... Up to now, all  demos, also the ones  by -Mind Design- were some kind of
        downwards  compatible with the  standard Falcon machines, just that they
        were a bit  slower... Will future productions still run on that machines
        in a so called "light" version, or will you skip those features?

ÚDeez... I tried to make "light" versions of everything I produced but in the end
Ú        it was too  hard and I really  didn't want  to cut out features since it
Ú        ruined the whole  thing and  I sometimes  had to re-arrange graphics, it
Ú        was too much work basically.
Ú        A Falcon demo  is planned for  EIL and it will require more than 14MB of
Ú        RAM so it wont  run on a standard Falcon. The reason for this is that we
Ú        wanted to produce something that takes advantage of the CT60.
Ú        Since the  demo will  be fully  optimised  for 060 it will run painfully
Ú        slow  on  a 16MHz  machine  so  we decided  to skip  compatibility  with
Ú        standard falcons all together and go for 32MB or more memory as well.


UCM.... If you really want  to go to create special CT6o demos, will you have an
        eye on  compatibility  to other  acceleration  boards  or  will  this be
        skipped as well then? So far the enhanced versions of several demos were
        happy to run on other acceleration boards as well. So what?

ÚDeez... This demo will run on any  Falcon as  long as  it has enough  memory, we
Ú        haven't yet decided what that magic  limit is but expect  something like
Ú        32MB or more. I think this demo will look like a big slideshow even on a
Ú        CT2 so there is no point trying to make it run on a slower machine.
Ú        150 CT60  boards has  been ordered  so the  userbase  is big enough even
Ú        though a lot of sceners still use a standard Falcon.


UCM.... So far  the label -Evolution- is  still surrounded  by  some mystic fog,
        many people  know about this, but  there isn't  anything we  can get our
        hands  on. When  will  you  launch  the -Evolution- webpage? I  heard at
        first, it will be  launched together  with the first  production, but as
        you announced  the first  releases for the EIL2k3, there is still a long
        time of that uncertainity. So can you enlight this thing a bit here?

ÚDeez... The website should be finished soon  I hope, we are working on this. I'm
Ú        not sure if the EIL demo  will be our  first release  or if we will have
Ú        time to finish  something before, right now  we are all  waiting for our
Ú        CT60s.


UCM.... Are there any precious things  to release in sight under the -Evolution-
        label, we can talk about, or is all stuff still top secret?

ÚDeez... Look out for our EIL production, it will knock you off the chair!


UCM.... I wonder if -Evolution- is  only tought  to produce  demos. As  far as I
        know you're  working in  professional  games development nowadays. Could
        this mean that you will make some steps in that direction on Falcon too,
        or aren't you interested by this in your free time?

ÚDeez... There are no plans  to release a game since this takes a lot of time but
Ú        personally I  have a few  ideas for games, not  sure if I ever will have
Ú        the time  to finish anything  though. Since  I'm currently un-employed I
Ú        have a lot  of time over for my own productions, however most of my time
Ú        is spent working  on various  demos for my  CV, some for PC and some for
Ú        Atari.


UCM.... And at last, what  dreams and toughts  do you have  for the  near future
        in your "scene life"? Do you have set any goals to reach atm?

ÚDeez... At the  moment I want to finish my old EIL'01 demo (!) aswell as our new
Ú        Falcon demo. I think  EIL'03 will  be a great  event, so  many people to
Ú        meet and so little time to do it!


UCM.... And, as usual, you  can spread now  a few greetings or ideas you have to
        our readers if you want...

ÚDeez... Make sure you attend EIL next year and dont miss the Falcon demo compo!


UCM.... Ok, many  thanx for  this little  interview  and  enlighting  a bit  the
        mysterious  fogs about -Evolution-. Good  luck for your coming works and
        see ya next time...
