                        German Atari Demo Scene Report 2oo3
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The longawaited EIL 3  party obviously  has  blown new  live  into the  starving
german Atari scene, that much life, that I finally can write a new  report about
it, the thing  I did so often  before and I always liked very much as it mirrors
the todays activities  of the Atari scene here in Germany, the part of the scene
I belong too...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñCHECKPOINT

Rumours about  unfinished  productions are  around since  several  years now and
since DEFJAM started to explore the  depths of Gameboy Advance and lately PalmOS
it seemed that the group was dying on Atari. So MODMATE left the active state of
pixels  as well  and lately  5o5 joined  the band CREATORS, but  without leaving
CHECKPOINT. But we  were wrong, again... At first  they recreated their homepage
completely and on Error In Line 3 the whole band came together again, not really
working together at all, but all members showed up, even MODMATE, who always was
speaking about leaving the scene.... ;)
Finally the  scene was surprised  with two stunning productions on Atari ST, the
longawaited "Posh!" demo and the 4k intro "4ster", that  both took the 1st place
in their competitions!
Furthermore the  single members took part in several other competitions as well,
with different success.
Anyway, the future  of CHECKPOINT on Atari is still very uncertain, as DEFJAM is
very addicted to PalmOS, still. So I think 5o5 will be the only member that will
stay really active...

current state ....... active, but no real cooperation between the single members
latest productions .. "Posh" (Atari), "4ster" (atari), some PalmOS demo
Atari projects ...... unknown
members ............. 5o5, Defjam, Joe Cool, mOdmate

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñCREAM

Unfortunately they were the -only- german band that didn't  showed  up with even
one  single  member on the  Error In Line. TAO  is still  active  for YM ROCKERS
mainly, but released some new JAM pluggin lately. Therefore ULTRA didn't matched
it to finish their longawaited "Heftig" demo, even if there were some strong new
rumours about it. So lets hope that this demo wont end in some trashcan someday.
At least we heard that  A.t. came back into the ring to work together with ULTRA
on "Heftig" again, that could be a good sign.
Apart from  this old thingie  there seem  to be no  real plans  for coming CREAM
productions, more  or less the  independent works of  the single members, mainly
TAO  seems to  be their  only lifesign  in  the  next time, or  should we really
believe the things written in the CREAM diary on their homepage?! ;)

current state ....... not active as group atm, only single members activities
latest productions .. new "JAM" pluggin "sonic arranger" (o2/o3)
Atari projects ...... "Heftig" ST demo, in work since 1999 (!)
members ............. A.t, Abyss, Tao, Ultra

ñCRUOR

This is the first real comeback to the german Atari scene since many years! They
vanished from the demo scene already in 1996 after their second 96Ktro on Falcon
and were  known for their s hot'em'up game "Painium Disaster" that vanished from
the  screen in  the late nineties  without  bigger success. After a split of the
original  band and  independent works  of them  on PC (ZWECKFORM took  the label
ANVIL SOFT, which was already used  for "Painium Disaster" as well, and released
some strange games on PC then, while  RAVING MAD founded a  team called  DRAGONS
BREATH on PC too) they lately  joined not  only their  forces again  but tried a
comeback  on the  Atari scene too  with  their  contribution  to the Falcon demo
competition at Error In Line. Furthermore there are still some  rumours about an
Atari STE demo or something, as well as some STE online archive. We will see...

current state ....... active as group as well as single activities (Zweckform)
latest productions .. "Falcon Contribution" (o4/o3)
Atari projects ...... some STE demo?
members ............. Raving Mad, Zweckform
url ................. ???

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñESCAPE

Even if they were bound into  organizing the Error In Line mainly, they were the
only german band  that released demo  stuffs in the last months, also before the
Party, such  as the  stunning intro  for "Chosneck # 3" and  last but  not least
their rocking demo "_" at the Party itself, that took the 1st place, again.
Since CHARON stepped further into demo development, ESCAPE can be counted to the
most promising  Falcon bands atm, as it seems to have the only active DSP coders
in the german scene! After the  release of "_" there are  no new projects in the
pipeline, at  least not announced. NO is  very strong  incorporated into the ACP
project besides his works for ESCAPE.

current state ....... active as group
latest productions .. "_" Falcon demo on EIL 3, "Chosneck # 3" intro
Atari projects ...... unknown
members ............. Charon, No, Shifter, Spex
url ................. òhttp://escape.atari.org

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñFOUNDATION TWO

Never really  involved in  the 16/32 bit  demo scene, FOUNDATION TWO, again  and
again popped up with some games for  ST and mainly  Falcon. But the growing 8bit
activities seemed to brake them out step by step on the other systems.
Now drifted nearly completely into the 8bit sector, we still  count them here as
MAD BUTSCHER still  has something  for our  beloved Falcons  in  preperation. At
first  he finally released  his strange game "DuSau" (for  the english  speaking
people: "you sow") that seems to be some kind of puzzle game and he was speaking
about since  long times. And, quite  unexpected, he even  announced another game
for  Falcon on his page  with screenshot, called "Steinbruch", that  seems to be
some puzzler as well.
What to say more as  they gained some new member, a female one btw, called N!NE,
that will support them as grafician and is, surprise, surprise, their 9th member
and active on ST machines. She appeared  on several  parties as ANGEL/SPELLBOUND
SOFT (?!) but seemed to be not really involved into the ST/Falcon scene so far.
Last but not least, the UNCONVENTIONAL PARTY 2oo3 was already announced.

current state ....... active as group but except MAD BUTSCHER only 8bit oriented
latest productions .. "DuSau", puzzle game for Falcon o6/o3
Atari projects ...... another Falcon game called "Steinbruch" (quarry)
members ............. Beetle, Mad Butscher, Moaco, Mr.XY, N!ne, RIK, TWH, Yellow
                      Man and Artie Stolks
url ................. òhttp://www.foundationtwo.de/

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñPARANOIA

Unfortunately they didn't matched it to present their mysterious STe demo on the
Error In Line 3, we have some rumours  again and again. Therefore they presented
some  little  screen written  on the  VMU of the Dreamcast?! Another  unfinished
project  seems to  be their  C16/Plus4 emulation for  Falcon and TT. As PARANOID
told me lately the view onto many different systems has splitted up the power of
the group too much and that the group isn't big enough to support 3 or 4 systems
and so they want  to focuse on Atari stuff mainly in the future. So we just have
to wait...

current state ....... active?
latest productions .. "Paracon 4 Invitro" 11/o2
Atari projects ...... Still the C16/Plus4 emulation and a STE demo?
members ............. Der Komtur, Luebke, Marcstar, Mr Future, Paranoid, Strange
                      and TNT

I just want to add that after the "BEAMS" demo there is no real group project in
the pipeline as the single members are stuck in several "private" projects.

ñWHO ELSE?!

apart from group  activities the  freelancing actors  are getting more and more.
Here I want to count  some independent people  that support the scene as well as
the last survivors of former demo groups...


ñCYCLONE/XTROLL

The progress on "LETHAL XCESS 2K2" slowed  down a lot but he's still around with
his  project. Now it was renamed into "Lethal Xcess XL" but the works seem to be
paused as CYCLONE told us lately, just because we have summer now ;)
Other works were the creation of a second XTROLL webpage apart from the original
group page that was created by NEXUS 6.

CYCLONE's XTROLL site: òhttp://www.edv-rudolf.de/xtroll/
CYCLONE's LETHAL XCESS site: òhttp://www.edv-rudolf.de/lethal-xcess/main.htm
NEXUS 6's XTROLL site: òhttp://xtroll.ubuxe.de/


ñNEMO

Since he closed down  his "Place To Be" webpage, he appears from time to time on
the screen, mainly to support several projects with his nice musix, just as some
demos, the YM ROCKERS project  or diskmags. Lately he popped up at Error In Line
where he took part in both music competitions with quite good success.


ñSAGE

Since he left ESCAPE he seems to close  down his former  demo activities  on the
computer  line of Atari. Therefore  he presented  the first -real- demo on Atari
Lynx including  some well known effects  from the ST... Furthermore  he is still
working on  several LYNX  game projects where  he gets again  and  again help by
FLASH/TNB.

òhttp://www.uni-giessen.de/~gd1113/


ñSUNNYBOY/ASM SOFTWARE

He left the CONSTRUCT CREW again and removed all  related stuff from  his sites,
now he  works freelancing  again. What  happened to his  intro  project that was
planned  for Error In Line isn't known. He lately  started to  search for people
who could support a possible  game project  and so we will  focuse on him in the
next weeks and months...

ñTHE NAUGHTY BYTES

Yes, since  this band has  lost all coders it's impossible to  see them  back as
group, but the remaining members still seem to be some kind of active. FLASH has
just won  the gfx competitions at EIL # 3 and is  preparing  grafix  for some of
SAGE's Lynx projects as well as  he supported ESCAPE with pixels in their latest
demo. FXL is still working on tracked musix as his two contributions on EIL were
able to show us... Lately we got  the information  that LOT  has got  some Atari
machines again... so we will see if they set him on fire again... ;)

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum... that's it for the people from the more demo oriented german "underground"
and in comparison with older reports the german Atari demo scene seems to work a
bit against  the usual  trend and  was "growing" for  the first  time since many
years  again. Ok, the "growing"  hasn't  to be  seen as real  turn-around of the
overall trend as several people were already active in the past and just started
a  comeback... but  who cares? It was  good for  the  Atari scene, esp. for  the
german scene, of course.

Ok, if I missed something, please get in  touch for the next report, planned for
the next issue, maybe?

òSo stay cool - stay Atari.
