                          ERROR IN LINE 2oo3 INTROS
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since òDefjams'ð winning  intro ñ"4ster"ð wasn't  released so  far I just can take a
look onto the two Reservoir Gods intros that were released short after the EIL as
well as on the 128 byters...

ñ... Charriots Of Fire 4 KB Intro ...

This one was coded by òDamoð and runs on ST and Falcon machines. It shows a little
animation of a running man who seems to burn or something. This comes along with
a little chiptune by òMSGð. If  you think there  is more to come you're wrong, you
can't even  leave the intro back to the desk... This  one is really no burner if
we remember to so many other 4k intros, sorry.

ñ... RG Rotator 4 KB Intro ...

This one was coded  by òStratagemð  and shows just a scroller made of dots that is
shown in two  layers in a little square. This thing flies  around on  the screen
and makes reading very hard. There  is no music  or something  but you can leave
the screen while pressing space. Not much to say about, just miles away from the
usual 4K style. This intro runs on any ST and Falcon.

ñ... Pipeline 128 Byte Intro ...

And another appearance by the òReservoir Godsð, this  time òPinkð had his fingers on
the keys and  presents  us a big head in red blocks and a pipe on a white screen
that is vertical  distorted. In  comparison with  many other 128 byters this one
isn't bad and shows even a little bit more as some Falcon 128 byters by Pink...
Yeps, this one runs on ST and Falcon as well.

ñ... Dbug Emulated Oric 128 Byte Intro ...

This  strange thing  was done by  òDbug of Defence Forceð  and brings us some real
strange stuff onto the screen. After a short Oric screen, showing the machine is
ready it  starts  to fill  the screen  with  coloured  lines  that are scrolling
upwards. That's  it. I don't  know much  about the  Oric computer and its colour
possibilities but this one seems to be  a little joke, as Dbug  had no Oric with
and used the ST to do so as this surely is no emulation ;)

Ok, that's it  for the little intros. The 4K intros  are far away from the usual
quality shown on parties before, if you remember  what stunning effects were put
into them in the past, on Falcon and ST. About the 128 byte  intros, dunno, I've
to admit that I was never a big fan of those coding madness' things as they show
of the skills of the coder without showing the possibities of the machine and as
I'm no coder I can't find any special things on them...

Ok, let's  hope to see  the winning  4k by Defjam  some when as  this one offers
enough to make a whole article out of it ;)
