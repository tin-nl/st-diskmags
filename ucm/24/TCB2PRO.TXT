
 How to do "DECENT" conversions from TCB-Tracker mods to Protracker mods (M.K.)
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After some  many years of  music collecting  and mod-ripping I  decided to write
down how to do  a good conversion  from  TCB-Tracker mods  to normal  Protracker
ones. When I did  some conversions lately  I recognized that I  forgot something
important  at the  end. Then I  decided to do  this list so that I  myself can't
forget and of the actions that has to be done.

1. There are  two different TCB-Tracker  module formats. Older  format and newer
   format. They have different headers "AN COOL." and "AN COOL!".

2. You need  a tool or better  a tracker-programm called AUDIO SCULPTURE created
   by SYNC. This program  is able to load TCB-Tracker modules  and can only save
   them as Protracker modules.

3. Make sure that "PACK IS OFF" when you save the module.

4. Problem 1: Audio Sculpture DOES NOT convert the loops of samples. You have to
   load the converted  module into a  protracker compatible tracker  to edit the
   loops already in Audio Sculpture.

5. Problem 2: Audio Sculpture  DOES NOT convert speed. You have enter the module
   speed by  hand aswell. Often you have  to listen to the original tune  in the
   demo to find out what's the correct speed.

6. Problem 3: Audio Sculpture  DOES NOT convert the correct length of  the song.
   There  is always  ONE MORE pattern then  in  the  source-module. You  have to
   decrease the length by ONE pattern.

7. Problem 4: You  might  have  guessed  it. Audio Sculpture  does  not  convert
   pattern breaks! So you have to figure  out where you  have to set the pattern
   breaks in the module... as usually by hand.

8. If you have  done everything  from that list you should have a good converted
   Ex-TCB-Tracker module.

Many people made  mistakes when  they converted TCB2PROTRACKER in the  past (hey
Artoax/Hydroxid... you DID NOT had the pattern breaks aswell). Just load it into
Audio Sculpture and then save it IS NOT ENOUGH. Please remember this.
