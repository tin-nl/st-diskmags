                           THE FUTURE OF UNDERCOVER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum... in the times I finished this magazine I thought again and again about the
future of it, the sense and the possibilities to hold it alive in the best way..

The  current  issue isn't the  burner, I know this  very well, but  it had to be
kicked out now to free my mind  and to lose the pain in  the ass, furthermore to
show after those quiet times, that UCM still exists.

Unfortunately  the few reactions  to the  poll and  the still low support on the
article front have made me thinking  about its future again and again, but I did
not found  another solution so  far as to put even more works from me into it to
hold it alive. I'm  feeling a  bit sad to  run against  walls while asking for a
litte support and also the fact that there isn't much coming from my group mates
makes the work even harder.

I just wonder that  it is far not  as hard to  get people into the ring for some
grafix and musix, but as you come to speak about articles, there is silence.
Sure, I have a lot  motivation and you  should know  that I even would  take the
burden  and write the whole magazine  alone, but I  doubt the  reactions will be
that good and I can  understand this, but this seems to be the only way nowadays
to hold it alive. UCM isn't a selfrunning thing anymore as it was 5 years ago...

And so I have to ask you again! Are you interested in doing something for UCM?

If yes, then please get in touch with me and tell me what you want to do!

With enough  response and  active support  we can hold the  magazine alive a bit
longer... and make it as colourful again as it was in the past...
It is your decision...
