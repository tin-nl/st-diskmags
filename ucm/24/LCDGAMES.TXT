                          LCD GAMES REVIVAL - PART 2
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, this was thought to be part two of the reviews of the little LCD games that
are bringing the ñGAME & WATCHð by òNINTENDOð  to the Atari machines but somehow the
whole story already found its end.

Lately I got a mail by  òFlorent Costeð, the  author of the games, who pointed out
that he didn't liked my  reviews that  much at the one  hand and that a harddisk
crash has  abruptly ended  his works for more  conversions at  the other. So the
games  ó"PARACHUTE"ð and  the pacman  clone by  òBANDAIð  called ó"PACK MONSTER"ð will
maybe never be finished  as all what is  left of those games are the screenshots
on his homepage. That is quite bad as he said that he had added several features
I missed on the games I had reviewed in UCM # 23, such as music and sound fx...

òIs this the end of ATARI.GAMES?!

So there is just one thing left atm. He has released a third game as well, it is
called ó"FIRE"ð and in my eyes ñthe most  interesting and funny oneð. It  still does
not feature any sound and effects but it is funny to play.

This one features a burning house with people that are jumping out of the window
and you're taking over the job of the fire fighters that are here with a net and
your goal is to  guide those  people with  the net to the  ambulance. So they're
jumping out  of the windows  and everytime  they smash onto  your net  they jump
again and you have to guide them on their way to the car.

Not that tricky  at the  beginning, but even  the easy mode gets quite hard very
soon, as the  house seems to  burn down, more and  more people  appearing on the
windows and jumping out of them, it doesn't matter if you're there or not... and
if you  aren't  fast enough it  makes a little "splat" and  you  can scratch his
intestines from the ground. So three and  more people are  jumping around on the
screen and you have to run left and right to catch them...

òWho's the next one?! Arf...

If you miss one he is displaied as "angel" on the right upper part of the screen
and if you have missed 3 the game is over and if you have catched enough you can
enter your name into the saveable highscore.

ñWhat to say?ð This game  is the ñmost funny  releaseð of ATARI.GAMES and maybe also
the last. Even if ñit still  misses a decent music and sound effectsð, it is quite
better as  the previous ones. Not that  the game concept is that much impressive
as it  doesn't differs  that much  from the  others, no... but at  least on  the
grafix side the thing looks a bit better and we're slowly reaching a point where
we can say, that all colours on the ST are used.

The  ñcontrols are goodð as  always, the saveable  highscore does its  own for the
motivation but the point that the game still only runs from disk sucks a bit.

Atm it is very doubtful if  there will  be more games  from òATARI.GAMESð since it
seems that the lost datas guided to a loss of motivation to go on as well... too
bad as the planned but lost releases looked far more interesting.
