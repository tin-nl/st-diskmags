Here it comes, after quite  long time again, the third release of the YM ROCKERS.
This time they  matched it, again, to  gather even more people for their project
and so it is  the first time, that every musician brings just one music into the
demo, very cool indeed  as we now also have  the chance to check out the work of
even more musicians.

The third edition of the YM ROCKERS music demos is named "Popstars" and  used to
run tirades of hate against the commercial  music industry, that is selling shit
to the public, and the dumb public, that  buys this  shit. That's the content of
the scrollers and  the title of  the demo makes you think, as we here in Germany
had a so  called star  search show  that brought  us some so called "superstars"
without  background, just  plastic poppers  nobody will  remember in a few years
anymore, but they sell them and their very dull music like hot sausages and that
is what many people don't understand... ñDon't follow the hype!

The demo itself  brings again  a òvery nice menu grafixð by óExocetð and is based on
the same shell as the previous  YM ROCKERS demos. This isn't a  real drawback as
it's "just" a music disk.

{*i POPSTARS.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

óThat's it...

We get 1o musix this time, of composers that are known from other rockers demos,
such as ó5o5ð, óDMA SCð, óTaoð, óNemoð and óLotek Style (MC Laser)ð as  well as musix from
new ones. Some  of them are  new appearing  on the ST chip musix  scene, such as
Gwem and some are musicians from other scenes, that swapped over to us and, last
but  not least, one  should be  known to  older  sceners as  well, óFrazer of The
óSyndicateð, who did very cool chipmusix for this cracking band in the past.

And as different  as the musicians  are so are the styles of them and, to say it
right  now, òthere are  quite interesting  musix  included!ð Apart  from  the more
classic composers like óLotekð, ó5o5ð and óDMA SCð, some of them produced very strange
stuff, such as  óGwemð, who included  even some  samplestuff and created some very
pumping track with technoing style.

òQuite outstandingð is also  óFrequentsð' entry that  starts  quite minimalistic and
surely is  a question of taste, and  since he steps  away from heavy-funky-demo-
music-style I like his tune very much as well.

Another strange thing  is the use of "old schoolish" chip drums, you  know those
"tschhhh, tch..." things, together  with clear drums and sid noises, sounds very
freaky. òYou surely  will find  a track you like  at the demo, it  doesn't matter
òwhat music taste you have :)

ñFinal words... "Popstars" moves on in the tradition of the  YM Rockers demos. It
ñ               presents us the todays chip-music-connection and shows  that also
ñ               in times of  16bit trackers  and MP3 music  that chip music isn't
ñ               dying out. Furthermore  the demo  presents some  statement of the
ñ               music making  underground about  the todays music scene and music
ñ               industry that is  just running after  money and forgets about the
ñ               music  itself. "Popstars" is  able  to top the  former YM Rockers
ñ               demos slightly as it features a bigger  range of musicians and so
ñ               a bigger range of interesting styles.

Ok, the overall  score doesn't blows  you off your pants, but I  would say a new
shell and some little supporting stuff like a little intro could do wonders!
