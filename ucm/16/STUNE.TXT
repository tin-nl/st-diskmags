With my limited German reading skills I managed to work out this is a Dune 2
clone :) And being a demo about the only thing I seemed to be able to do was 
get my arse kick by the computer. Firstly this is a GEM based game, so even ppl
with Milans and Hades machines should be able to play it if they go into a 16/ 
256 colour mode. Well this is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) Game where your trying
to save Aratis from the Macrosaft-Imperium. You get presented with 2 windows, 
one a map where you control your units and the other gives you info on them or 
your buildings. You get one Erntemaschune which gathers green stuff off the 
ground which it then take back to the Raffinerie to get you money, then you 
have a few tanks and buggies to kill stuff with. Unforntunately it looks like
you can't build anything, so that was about it One other thing that annoys me
about it is that just like Dune you can only select one unit at a time.
Luckily you can repair your buildings if you do get attacked or even sell them.
You can get a mini-map, not that it shows much ATM, but it is better then 
scrollbars for looking around the map.

All I can say is, if this gets finished it could be a great game to come.
