ñ ------------------------------ð by òMike Stevenð ñ-------------------------------ð


    Coming out from who knows where here's Mike Steven. Another lonely coder who 
finally decided to give away  his productions. I downloaded these 3 screens from 
óDHS homepageð (where else ? :-) not knowing what to expect...

     Though as I've just told you this package  includes 3 screens, respectively 
called ñGabber,ð óHappy Hardcoreð and òSpeedcoreð I just don't feel like going through 
3 different reviews esp as these screens are very similar to each other.

     Once you've loaded the first one (or even from the name of the screens) you 
quickly come to  realize that  Mike is a hardcore  fan : each screen  features a 
heavy sample  unfortunately  slaughtered by a òcrappy sound qualityð (12.5 Khz ?). 
Every time you'll find the same  sorts of  effects in  these screens : the upper 
border is filled with a huge  scrolltext most of  the time with a ripped font of 
ñpoor quality.ð In the middle of the screen  you find a distorting logo  that look 
like a ócomatose  snailð (yep  that  slow !!!) flanked  by equalizers  filled with 
rasters. In the lower  border there is  a moving  carpet (twice it is horizontal 
and once vertical) with flashing colors and a ripped logo or picture.

    All these  effects look òoldð  and ócrappyð : the distorts  are very slow not to 
mention the scrolltexts that  are not  smooth at all (what an  understatement !) 
most colors are not well chosen and the ripped elements look like shit. I'm sure 
you could could the very same screen with the so old fashioned ñDemo Construction ð
ñKit...ð

    óBottom Lineð : there isn't much good  in  these 3 screens. They look the same 
and that's not a good  thing  either : òcrappy,ð ñslow,ð ólousy  design and low sound ð
óqualityð remind me of some demos from the late eighties. Crap, crap and crap.
