{*f1 THE GAME COMPO IS ON !{*f0

ò                         General informationð

This is the first annual MagiC Online, in conjunction with The X, MagiC
programming competition. The judges will be the MagiC community. All
entries will be available for download on December 5th, 1999. At this time,
voting sheets will be made available to the general public. The winner(s)
will be notified on Christmas Day, December 25th, 1999. This means that all
nominations must be recieved by December 24, 1999.
The goal is to create the best possible conversion of a classic game.
Examples would be conversions of Asteroids, pacman, frogger. A list of many
possible conversions can be viewed at http://bengy.atari.org/list.htm. The
catch is however, that the game must be created to run perfectly under
MagiC in a GEM window.  Compatability with MiNT/TOS is expected but not
mandatory.

                               óThe Rulesð

* All interested programmers and/or groups which feel that they might be
interested in entering this competition must e-mail one of the organizers
(Bengy Collins, Jan Daldrup) and confirm their registration. Remember,
registration is free, but we need it in order to set up prizes and
determine if this competition should be cancelled or not. The Entry
deadline is September 15th 1999! NO REGISTRATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER
THIS DATE.
* The new system calls in NVDI can be used only as enhancements to the
game. The game must be fully functional on bare (Standard) MagiC
configurations. However, the game is allowed to take advantage of system
extensions as long as the extensions are freely available. Example:
BubbleGEM
* The game must either be shareware or freeware. However, if the shareware
path is chosen, the game can not be crippled in any way.
* The game must come with documentation. ST-Guide and Text versions are
acceptable.
* Game control will be one or more of the following: Keyboard, Mouse,
Joystick, Joypad.
* Sound and music can be used using XBIOS calls, thus allowing
compatibility with MagiC PC. GEMJing may also be used.
* The game can not be officially released until Competition judging
(December 5th, 1999). Games which are released before the end of the
competition and games which already exist are disqualified.
* Any individual or crew may submit as many programs as desired.
