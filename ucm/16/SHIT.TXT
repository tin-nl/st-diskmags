            Surely the ólamestð shit I've seen for years !!!

    I won't waste much time on this review. Unsurprisingly no one wanted to 
review this supposedly  funny production. From the name of it you will have 
understood that it was to be a parody of the Undercover Magascene. Well before I 
start I must notify that I had that opinion òBEFOREð I came to take Moondog's seat 
at the head of the UCM.

    This is an ASCII pseudo magazine that features the most famous and regular 
articles from the UCM like the news section, the editorial, some reviews and 
much more but I cannot tell you since I long deleted this óshitð from my 
harddrive.
 
    Really when I first read it I thought Moondog was responsible for it and 
that he had blown a fuse ! This fake magazine is just about saying all guys are 
ólamers !ð There isn't the slightest piece of òrespectð to anyone around and only a 
ófucking lamerð could have written such crap ! All of us are treated like shit and 
I cannot stand it !

    All in all if this piece of ógarbageð was to be given a rate it would go far 
under zero ! I think I know who did that (well it's getting old now) but I just 
don't understand that sort of release : what's the point óinsultingð everyone 
around ??? Even drunk like hell I wouldn't say stuff like that ! If you happen 
to disagree with me I'm ready to launch a debate but as far as the persons 
behind this are concerned I hope never to see such a production ever !
