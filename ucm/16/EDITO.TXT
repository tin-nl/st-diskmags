    I cannot believe I've  managed to  complete another  issue of UNDERCOVER esp 
this time  without  Moondog's  help (take care my  friend) !! Time is  half past 
midnight and I still  have to pack a  couple of articles  before I  can  at last 
assemble the mag (and then zip it ;-). Humm seems I still have an hour before me 
but I hope everything will be fine.

    I've spent the whole day running  from my father's old PC to  my STe getting 
connnected to the net to  download votesheets and  well forget it, it's my curse 
not yours 8-) I must thank óGREEDOð who  gave me a great  hand when I had to count 
the votes (hey 8 full hours of torture !!).

    Earx sent me a new  shell that  should  not crash  on Falcon so  let's cross 
fingers ;-) I hope you've enjoyed the great intro by Evil (it rocks !!!) and the 
cool musics and gfx provided  for this  issue. Don't hesitate  to contact us for 
next issue as we always need gfx, an intro and ó*WRITERS*ð too !!!! By the way the 
latest version of the Article Construction  Kit (that no one uses 8-( is on this 
disk so for god's sake USE IT !!!

    ST users who only have half a meg of memory can run the intro by copying it
to an AUTO folder and rename it *.prg. Enjoy Evil's stunning code Keops 8-)

    I'm too tired to go on with that crap talking. Enjoy reading the  mag and be 
ready to send me nasty comments to òsurvivor@atari.org
