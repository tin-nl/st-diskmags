ñIbizað by òPoets of Bombayð (óFalconð) [Error in Line'99 release]

The òPoets of Decayð, responsible for this magazine in general, have
been given all kinds of nicknames. ñProfets of Delayð by the infamous
ñUndiscovered Mangasceneð, ñPoets of Betrayð and some other, less nice
nicknames.
Well, they say any kind of advertisement is good advertisement so i
assume that the fact that the editors of a competing diskmagazine named
ñMaggieð [read a review about the latest issue of Maggie, 27, in this
issue of ñUCMð] disguised as òPoets of Bombayð to bring us the winning
óFake-demoð at the òError in Line'99ð-party.

The demo is more or less named ñA tribute to Ibizað and it stands out of
the crowd of other fakedemos that it actually has a "topic" to stick to.
Since it is a fakedemo, don't really expect a full review here getting
into every detail of each picture or moving element - because just like
with all fakedemos: It's hardly worth it.
Let's just say, the demo displays a lot of ñjust-a-little-less-than-
ñ16-colour-picturesð and ñ-animationsð, showing fluffy condoms, brain-
pierced persons (PC-users ?), freshly sliced lemons, a dance-hall with
dancing people in 2 animation-steps, horny girls ... well, not really,
let's say, poor abstracted 5 colours handdrawings of what may probably
look like a girl if one really tries hard to identify with just a slogan
saying that this is supposed to be a horny girl.
DJs appearing with girls falling in love or running away screaming,
lesbian action - again with miserable handdrawn pictures of something
that just barely resembles the characteristics of female human anatomy.
The demo closes with the words "forget the rest, Atari is the", followed
by the credits.
In the end, Ibiza explodes in a really lousy 3 picture animation with
some annoying colour-flashing.

In contrast to the really lousy graphics, the music is not very "fake"
but rather a summary of samples from well-known music-tracks with some
again not-so-bad sounding soundsamples in between.
Additionally, the scrolling of the end-credits is smooth and the
programming of the demo is not that bad at all. It runs even with NVDI
and a screen-expander in memory, even with an accelerator turned on and
best of all it runs flawlessly on VGA- and RGB-Monitors.
Further the updating of the screen is well done, the demo is not flickering
at any time.

Let's do the resume.
As a "fake-demo" this is a complete flop. The demo doesn't parody any of the
typical demo-effects like the grandfather (he he) of all fake-demos, the
ñAirdirtð-demo by the òSenior Dadsð did. It doesn't feature any "effects" at
all, it's mainly graphics, animations and samples.
Furthermore, the typical total misunderstanding of basic programming 
techniques a fake-demo requires to make scrollers flicker like mad, to make
samples scratch and squeek and never run in time, to make sprites move in a
way that you can watch the screen being updated or to make graphics never
fit the screen is not given in this demo.
On the contrary, the demo is relatively well written - for a fakedemo.
Only the graphics and animations are "bad" enough to put this demo into the
category of a fake-demo.

On the other hand, the demo is funny and therefore stands out of the crowd
of really óveryð lame fakedemos written the last time. Because basically,
this demo shows some funny scenes which in their own special way have indeed
the skill to amuse the viewer for a while.
I wouldn't therefore call this a fake-demo. It's more a joketro, a simple
demo that is supposed to make you laugh or smile, not because of the way
the computer presents effects but because of what is actually being 
displayed.
Considering this, the demo won the óError in Line'99ð competition really
fair and square.
It's not a real fake-demo, but very well worth a look.
