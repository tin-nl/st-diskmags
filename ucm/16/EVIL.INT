 ñINTERVIEW with:ð                                      òEVIL/DEAD HACKERS SOCIETYð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñHi Evil.ð

ñIt really took us a long time to be at this point to make an interview betweenð
ñyou and UCM. We had many arguings in the past and rough words were fallen duringð
ñthis time but finally we are here. Latest happenings and your immense engagementð
ñfor the atari-scene have forced me to punish you with my questions.ð



òUCM:       Hiya Evil. First tell us a little bit of your Computer-history.
ò           How did you start computing and what groups you were in and why
ò           such a pseudonym? Are you really that evil?

óEVIL:      Hello MC Laser.

ó           I started in the mid 80's with a Spectrum 48k, and quickly boughtð
ó           a Spectravideo MSX after that. I really liked this computer,ð
ó           and I used it almost only for playing games. I did a small glosseryð
ó           program and did some graphics in basic (with point/lines etcð
ó           commands).ð

ó           Then, I saw "Testdrive" on my friends new Atari ST, and there was
ó           no question. I had to get one.

ó           So I bought a used 520 STm (with SF354 singlesided floppy).
ó           Luckily the games worked with singlesided floppy at this time, and
ó           it took me a halfyear or so to buy a new drive. Then, another
ó           halfyear later, I upgraded to 1mb ram (I still remember the bill,
ó           approx 200 euro!).

ó           That setup lasted for a couple of years, then the new STe was
ó           released and there was no doubt; I had to get it. 8-channel
ó           sound, hardware scrolling etc etc. Well, the hype was false, the
ó           machine was pretty much like my old ST, except that it had a new
ó           TOS version, and from TOS 1.0 to 1.6 there were improvements
ó           enough to justify the buy.

ó           About a year before I bought the STe, me and a few friends got
ó           intersted in making demos. And formed a group called X'press Crew.
ó           We released a sampledemo for the ST. It's so bad I wish I could
ó           forget about it.

ó           Back into the 90's now.. my interest for demos grew, and so did
ó           X'press Crew. I think there were five members as most:

ó           - Dr.Stein (later Criz/2smart4u and now Bellman/DHS)
ó           - Jonas (sorry I forgot his handle)
ó           - Raw
ó           - Evil
ó           - Alibaba

ó           We worked on several basic megademos. None were released. Instead
ó           we put a few screens into the "Friendchip" STOS Demos, although
ó           our screens was made with GFA Basic. I'll see if I can find those
ó           later and put up for download.

ó           Around the end of 1991, only me and Dr.Stein was active in the
ó           crew, so we formed an "umbrella"-organisations with the Vikings.
ó           The Vikings was two members if I remember correct, but I only met
ó           one of them; Loke. The organisation was called "The Complexion"
ó           and we were working on a megademo with STe specific screens and
ó           various plasma and fullscreen parts. I was really looking forward
ó           to releasing this one. But it was about now I realised how hard
ó           it is to motivate coders. They simply fell into idleness and you
ó           could say that X'press Crew, Vikings and then of course Complexion
ó           was dead by now. This is the first quarter of 1992, before the
ó           legendary Megaleif Convention by Electra.

ó           At this time, me and a few friends from The Creators (ET and
ó           Slitsten), The Golems (Toodeloo) decided to join forces and created
ó           the Dead Hackers Society. A few months later Loke joined and
ó           Dr.Stein started a DHS BBS (it was only up for some months, I
ó           don't belive anyone would know about it).

ó           And that's it, DHS have had many new members, many lost members
ó           since then, but it's still alive (a bit anyway).


ó           Ever heard "Am I Evil" by Metallica? There you have the answer to
ó           my choice of pseudo. And if I live up to my nick? Probably not,
ó           I'm too much of a chicken I guess.




òUCM:       When and why was DHS founded and what are your current jobs in the
ò           crew? I can remember that you were not a coder some years ago. What
ò           did you force to start coding?

óEVIL:      Well how DHS was founded you can see in the previous answer.
ó           I'm currently trying to program and paint some gfx for DHS.

ó           We started to cooperate with IMP in 1995, and we were more or less
ó           like one crew then. However, all IMP coders (well there were only
ó           one) and DHS coders gave up after the Aggro-II "Demolition" demo.

ó           Approx one year after Agrro-II I met Gizmo/TBL. Incredible that
ó           I havn't met him before this, as he lives close. We started to
ó           co-work a bit, he made me some routs, I made him some gfx.

ó           And early summer/97 Gizmo released his last TBL Amigademo (last
ó           so far anyway). This had several parts that we haved used in
ó           the Dream Dimension demo as well. It's quite fun; the Amigademo
ó           was out approx half a year before Dreamdim and still it was mainly
ó           made for the Falcdemo. So if you ever see "Panacea" from TBL, it
ó           has some almost identical parts to Dream Dimension (the raycast
ó           tunnel in particular).

ó           To get anything on Atari, I had to start programming a bit.
ó           And to my surprice, ET seemed happy to code a little again as
ó           well. He made a small demo-system for our "4-ever" 4k intro,
ó           and I tried to implement some of Gizmos routs, added some of what
ó           I had done by then (blur, bump..) and the 4-ever was done.

ó           After this ET began his mega-idle which hasn't stopped yet, and
ó           Gizmo got really busy with school. So I had to continue the
ó           programming, and I made one small prod after the other, just for
ó           the practise (chip1, chip2, jm3, xmas97..). And meanwhile I worked
ó           with the Dream Dimension.

ó           And well, I'm still waiting for the coders to stop idle!



òUCM:       What is your current equipment and what stuff of them are you
ò           still using?

óEVIL:      512k STfm. This one has a broken floppydrive and no hd.
ó           So currently it isn't being used. :-(

ó           4mb STe. It has SCSI disk, track led display, double-tos
ó           and other small extras. I use this one alot.

ó           4mb Falcon (soon to get 14mb). A lightning partyly killed this
ó           one. It's my first Falcon I spent a fortune to buy. It now has
ó           a faulty SCC. Gizmo is borrowing it, if he would get mad and
ó           want to code again.

ó           68mb Falcon. It has got a Centurbo II, 17" VGA, some gigs SCSI
ó           and blabla. It's my normal machine. I use it for everything.

ó           8mb 386. It's in the closet. The old DHS North BBS.



òUCM:       Please tell us your fave games and demos on Falcon and/or ST.

óEVIL:      I answered this question one time before, and tried to explain
ó           then that my favourite demos are those I really felt happy to
ó           get. Not how I rank them technically or designwise after some
ó           detail checking.

ó           So, I like the Steps musicdemo from Tao alot! I was sooo happy
ó           to hear those songs, his YM abilities are endless.

ó           The Grotesque from Omega was a hit in the face, I don't think
ó           anyone had expected it. They won the Megaleif compo, but didn't
ó           release anything. Then all the sudden, they went to a small
ó           party with this demo, won the compo and released! Cool, I loved
ó           the demo from first sight. Great sync. Excellent.

ó           The Obonoxious demo on the Falcon, and the Autowaschen Verboten
ó           are the ones I got most happy about, no doubt. So they still
ó           rank the highest in my opinion. I know, there are tons of
ó           other which are better technical. It doesn't matter, those demos
ó           made me so happy!

ó           For games; Wings Of Death is my favourite on Atari. But I
ó           played the most games on MSX, and then I liked space shootem'ups
ó           as well. Such as Galaga, Sky Hawk and Nemesis.

ó           On the Falcon my favourite game is Towers II I belive. It's
ó           great fun even if the actual routine to draw the world is
ó           slow and look crap.



òUCM:       The best memory you have from your life in the atari-scene?
ò           (best party, etc...)

óEVIL:      I am having the best Ataritime ever right now.

ó           Everything just rules, parties (EIL, IMP..), people (too many
ó           to mention, but most are GREAT pals and friends!).

ó           The online people are easing up alot, you can send a beta and
ó           have feedback five mins later. It's terrific.

ó           I've been to many parties, but never has there been such good
ó           athmospehre as at the EIL. The Megaleif was good, larger, more
ó           demos. But it lacked something the EIL got, hard to tell
ó           exactly.



òUCM:       How did it came to those online-competitions you are running
ò           nowadays and what other compos will come up in the future?

óEVIL:      Me and Setok/Aggression made a modcompo for non musicans
ó           back in summer 1996. Unfortunetly only me and Setok made mods
ó           that time.

ó           After this, there was much talk about a sequel. And it took
ó           place two and a half years later (dec 1998).

ó           And after that there were many suggestions, but it took until
ó           late april to decide the next compo (4col). And right now
ó           I'm getting email bombed with votesheets for the SSD compo.

ó           Future compos are a secret, what fun would there be if
ó           everyone knew half a year in advance what to do? No, those
ó           compos should be more spontanious.



òUCM:       Why did you create #ATARISCNE on IRC?

óEVIL:      #atari didn't really live up to it's name.

ó           Most people had bought PCs, talked how high FPS their Quake
ó           got. And if you tried to ask them to goto another channel,
ó           all you got back was silence. And if you took it a stake
ó           higher, and kicked them, you were a tyrrant, ignoring
ó           bastard or simply an idiot that didn't understand how good
ó           Quake was.

ó           This was after approx 5-6 years #atari ircing for me. But
ó           enough is enough and I started the #atariscne with SWE and
ó           Ozk mainly. Here we could kick those we wanted and not get
ó           shit for it. However, I see things are slowly going back
ó           to where #atari was when I left, and it's really boring.

ó           Perhaps time for a cleanup? We'll see.



òUCM:       Why do you always use a FPU? Do you want to force all Falcon users
ò           to get one? My personal opinion is that this cheating has nothing
ò           to do with good code.

óEVIL:      I don't always use fpu.
ó           I don't want to force anyone to do anything.
ó           If you don't like our demos, well just don't download. It's not
ó           exactly like we force you to.



òUCM:       As I have heard, the code for SWEETY was your first ST Code ever.
ò           What can we expect in the future in this direction, btw what else
ò           will we see from DHS? Future projects?

óEVIL:      Nothing new is currently planned.

ó           The projects in action are:

ó           - SSD intro for the compo. Should be released 4 days from when
ó             I write this.

ó           - Just Musix 4. Delayed as hell, but I got busy with two demos
ó             between december-april, and after april my falcon got
ó             killed by a centurbo 2.

ó           - ST demo-devkit for Amiga. So Amigacoders easily can code
ó             ST-demos (they don't even need an ST).

ó           - Falc demo-devkit for Amiga. As above but harder to do, will
ó             take a longer time to finish.

ó           - New DHS homepage. Fully modular, database and jsp based.



òUCM:       Can you tell us what the YELLOW BUNKER is?

óEVIL:      It's a place (room) we rented for DHS when DHS started in 1992.
ó           We painted it yellow (we had no other colour). It lasted for
ó           five years, but then the we had to chance house, and we now
ó           have a white bunker.



òUCM:       How are you involved in the ATARI.ORG-Server thing?

óEVIL:      I'm doing much of the gem.atari.org email/subdomain account
ó           admin. Generally looking over the dear little machine.



òUCM:       Now for some personal stuff (you don't have to answer). Have you ever
ò           thought of loosing weight? Maybe take part in a weight watchers
ò           programm or something like that?

óEVIL:      Did you ever thought of doing a nosejob?



òUCM:       As far as I know you once where SYSOP of the DHS NORTH BBS. Why did
ò           you put it offline?

óEVIL:      Because I didn't have time for both BBS and keeping the homepage
ó           alive. The choice was easy, as I was already tired of the BBS.



òUCM:       What's/Who's your fave music/artist? Fave Chipmusic/Chipartist?

óEVIL:      I like so much music, many different styles. I enjoy death metal,
ó           normal metal, synth-pop (koto..), goa, chipmusic (and I mean I
ó           like chipmusic, not just think it's cool to hear monty and
ó           commando sids twice a year. I record audio-cd's with chipmusic).

ó           I like Mercyful Fate, Crystal Method, Jeroen Tel, Ozzy, Tao,
ó           Man with no name and much more, it's an endless list.
