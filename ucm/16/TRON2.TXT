ñTron 2ð by òThe Matchð of òFUN Industriesð (óFalconð) [PMP release]

We all know ñTronð, don't we ? The funny side of all this is that the
game is originally named ñLightcycleð and simply appears in the movie
òTronð, which is why how the game got its name.
Basically 2 (or sometimes more players) control a small motorcycle, the
ólightcycleð, which leaves a òwall of lightð as a blueprint. Other cycles,
and not even the own one, may collide with that wall. So the essence of
the game is to trap the opponent inside the walls and at the same time
avoid walls yourself.

ñTron IIð brings some new aspects to it. First, it only runs on the
òFalconð, even though it only needs ò320 x 200ð pixels in ò16ð colours.
There is some ñtechno-like musicð being played and a small intro is
being shown during startup.
The game itself can be played alone or with one human opponent and
is basically a very direct ñlightcycleð-variant. The only real difference
is the existance of ñextrasð. Some speed up the opponents lightcycle, some
remove your own line, some make you draw no line, some slow you down.
Additionally, there are extra-lives, decrease-your-opponents-lives, bombs
and stones.
The extras is the only thing interesting when playing alone. Because then
the only task of the game is to stay alive as long as possible and catch
as many extra-tokens as possible as each extra is only on screen a specified
amount of time ... and not a second longer - which is why you always have
a ñtimerð in the upper right corner of the screen.
The extras on the other hand really give the game the twist it has when
playing with a human opponent. Without the hunt for the extra just appearing
somewhere, the game wouldn't be as funny as it is.

ñTron 2ð is neither the ultimate kick in Falcon games nor is it the definitive
ñLightcycleð-game. The graphics are not too hot, although the graphics are
not essential for the gameplay, they òcouldð have been done better though.
The music starts nice, but is a little too short and gets a bit boring after
a while. The game does not offer to divert controls to a óJaguar PowerPadð
or keyboard, ó2 joysticksð are needed for a 2 player-game, which is untypical
for a òFalconð-game. There are no background graphics in the menu or the 
game and no other effects ... Basically, the game could have been done 
identically on a ó1040 STEð.
Playing ñTron 2ð alone is of course unfair. This is a game one has to play
with 2 players - Thanks to Mad Butscher of Foundation Two for testing it
with me. Playing it alone is at least possible in ñTron 2ð. It is not as
funny then but the hunt for the extras is a kind of good idea to keep even
the 1-player mode interesting.
On the other hand, ñTron 2ð is fun to play for a while when being played 
with a human opponent. If you never liked ñLightcycleð-games, you won't
like this either, however, if you did, give ñTron 2ð a go, it is a fun
game.
Nevertheless, there are still things which could have been done better
besides the mediocre graphics and the average soundtrack. The option to
collect extras and launch them by hand would have been neat as it would
have added a ñtactical aspectð to the game. Allowing more than 2 players
would have been a good move too as it's easy to have 4 players on the
Falcon using the óextended Joystick-portsð.

When comparing ñTron 2ð with other recent ñlightcycle-gamesð, like
ñHighly Sideð from òCobaltð, ñZe Traceð by òTyphoon & LouDð, ñLombricð
by òJFF & Depressionð, ñTron 2ð looks not too hot to be honest.
But on the other hand, it is fun as it has its own style and for a game, 
that's what counts after all.
