ò===============================================================================ð

First problem, this must be started in ST LOW. Once started you get a Final 
Journey logo, then some weird curve effect which I'm not sure how to describe 
so I won't, a cartoony pic of a guy in a blue atari t-shirt on a downer, next 
are some spinning dots, a cartoony pic of a cow, spinning lines and then the
credits, which was pics of both fuzzkid and oPUs. To be honest the text 
file kept me amused longer :) But then again they do point out how lame they 
are.
Overall: 21%
