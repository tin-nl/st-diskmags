             óLAST PARTY '98ð - total hangover and unslept nights...
                a very short party report by ñGrey / Mystic Bytesð 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
       First of all i would like to notice it won't be the biggest party report
at all, sorry.  There was not too much action  at the party,  so I will  try to  
concentrate much more on the facts than craptalking about "what a great weather 
we had" or "how many bottles of beer we drunk" (who  would count  these bottles 
anyway ;) 

okie, let's buggin..
  
      "Last party", as the name says, was the last polish  atari-related  party
in 1998 year.  It has  been held  in late December  in the  little  town called 
Opalenica (I have seen a cow walking on the street, so you can imagine yourself
how big "city" it was...). It was a 2nd edition, however the number of visitors 
didn't increase - around 40 atarians came, half xl/xe and half st/fo3o sceners. 
The propotions of each system has changed anyway - last year there was a 95% of 
XL/XE users due to the fact that officially st/falcon users weren't invited :-(
(the most annoying thing was, that one of most famous 8-bit graphicians told to 
my friend "he won't come on the party  where st and falcon users are invited as 
well"). Never heard a similar shit before! 


      The following crews from the st/falcon scene appeard at the party:
 
       - - - -->òcOBRAð -   Winio has been busy coding his 1st
                            falcon demo. Everybody admired his
                            enthusiasm doing that, except a cute
                            Monika (his girlfriend) :-)) this
                            demo features lotsa 3d objects and
                            textured tunnels - quite impressive 
                            if you notice that it's a 1st Winio
                            effort! Surely beats lotsa of the
                            latest releases. Winio went out with
                            his girlfriend and back with two
                            champagnes to celebrate a finished
                            release! 

       --- -- ->òeLITEð -   Orby was recording a couple CDs
                            to some ppl. He has shown lotsa new  
                            cracks, e.g. Running. Orby explained
                            he doesn't care if it's a scene stuff
                            or not. He "has lotsa fun breaking 
                            every protecion" - that's what he 
                            said. 
 
  - - -->òmYSTIC bYTESð -   Sqward has been busy finishing the
                            1st volume of the msx colly called 
                            "Scene Music Compile". Atfer a few
                            minutes we were ready to sperad it
                            out! I've been spreading the latest
                            issue of ST+ fanzine.
 
     - - --->òpRESTIGEð -   Adamsky was going to complete the
                            9th issue of "Echo" magazine, but
                            due to the lack of articles he
                            decided to release it a couple weeks
                            later. 
 
      -- - - ->òwHELPZð -   This crew didn't release anything
                            what wasn't a big surprise at all...
                            (this crew is DEAD now) Has been 
                            "fuckin' active"...
 

Paskud (the most famous  atari-hardware developer in Poland) came with a lot of 
stuff dedicated to ST/Falcon machines. As usual you could buy memory extensions 
to your Falcon,  IDE interfaces to STs and new CDs.  He was  spreading  out the 
little callendars with Atari logos on it.. Nice stuff.

Well, let's look at the party-place...  The so called  "main room"  was not the
biggest at all... Thank God that only 40 ppl came! There was not too much place 
left and I can't imagine more people walking in that room... 

Okay, let's look around the party place... food service open for 24h, cool! And
hey, beer is available! Yummie! :-)) That was probably the coolest place at the 
party =) Sqward, Adamsky, Vulgar, MacGyver and me were losing our time on crap-
talking and drinking some "stuff" (guess what). While I am here I would like to 
thank MacGyver for buying us the beer! That was so sweet, dude!      
   
Because beer is  a well-known "urine-pusher" I was going to "visit" the toilet.
I asked for directions...  okay here I come! But hey, what the f*ck is going on
here?!  Door has no handle! ARGH! Someone guy told me that I have to ask a main
organizer for the door handle... WHAT?!  Is it a joke??  Gee!! I spent a couple
minutes on finding him. That was really a dull move, man! Maybe you were afraid
that someone will try to whipe his ass using a door handle? Dunno...

Message to all people going at the next edition of that party - 

TAKE YOUR OWN DOOR HANDLES!!
 
Eh, sorry... ;-)) I shouldn't talk about these things here, but that was really
annoying. Let's skip it..
    
I had a nice chat with two guys from òBit Bustersð- recently one of the coolest
8-bit crews in Poland.  Their coder told me he was thinking about buying Falcon 
in the future. In that case I was looking around for Sqward and both of us were 
trying to show him all Falcon features. He seemed to be quite impressed :) 

Some editor of the  "local newspaper"  came to make a little report  about this 
meeting. Cool, huh? He seemed to be quite friendly.. Yup, he "seemed"... On the 
2nd day someone bought this newspaper and  we could  read the following subject
on the top  "Who remembers about  Atari  still?",  "these  poor computers which 
flooded polish market in the past?" etc... "What a fuckin' sucker!" we screamed  
reading this.. Some chaps (e.g. Sqward, Winio and me)  were even going to visit 
that guy and "shake" him a bit..  He probably thought about  8-bit  Ataris  but 
anyway... He shouldn't write such craps.. In the past these "poor 8-bit Ataris"  
were  the most popular here  and surely  the most professional  8-bit  machines 
available in that time. Comparing these 8-bit  machines to recent times is just 
ridiculous  and I really can't understand that move.  This guy had to be brain-
limited...

Okay pals, it's time for a little summary...

The LaST Party '98 wasn't a bad party at all... But  I can't  compare it to any
parties I have been before.  There was _NOTHING_ to do in the free time. If not 
the  weird ideas of us (Sqward,  Winio,  Adamsky,  Ramsess  etc.) we would have 
gotten bored to death.   

The entrance fee was òreallyð too high for that kind of the party (30zl= 15DM). 
Sure, it's not that much for the people outside but for us it was  pretty much.
(for these money we could attend other parties  with a lot of attractions which
filled the time perfectly until the competitions).    
 
The LaST Party '98 was surely a great occasion to see the latest XL/XE releases 
but nothing more :/
