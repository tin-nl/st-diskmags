{*f1SENTRY PACKER{*f0

   ñ------------------------ A short review ------------------------ð

Reviewing a packer, hmm.. how is it done? I mean, either is does what you
ask of it or not right? Well, almost..  Most files (esp. demos/intros)
needs to be packed, atleast to make sure a fast download from the
internet, which then leads to shorter time spent online and you save
some money :)

Demos like 4k's and 96k's are very depending on the packer, as it sometimes
is very close to the given byte-limit. 4k intro are preferably programmed to
be relocateable to get rid of some extra code in the program to do that.
That makes them very dependent on the packer.

The Sentry Packer looks exactly like the previous 2.2 version, even the
date of release is the same, 1st August, 1995. The only difference in the
interface seems to be the version number. However, the difference between
2.2 and 2.3 are huge!

I only had time to test to files, one was a 479kb big demoscreen by me, the
other one was a 410kb 4channel module.

The author (Frans van Nispen) states in the included textfile that 2.3
includes ADPCM for samples and modules, otherwise it seems to be the same
algorithm as 2.2. Frans also writes that the new improved algorithm for
samples and modules should reduce the size of a 4 channel mod to about
30-45%.

As you can see from the diagram below it doesnt differ anything between 2.2
and 2.3, as comparison I included results from Atomik 3.6 and ICE-pack 2.40
The new routines for samplepacking is VERY improved, the new 2.3 version
is about 60% size compared to version 2.2!!

The difference in speed is enormous when you compare sentry with some
of the other popular packers, Sentry is lightyears ahead! But, we should
remember that out of these packers, Sentry is the newest one and ICE-pack
(my own personal favourite) is from 1991, the Atomik version I had si from
1993, but this doesnt change the fact that Sentry is by far the fastest.
When it comes to applications, the speed isn't really the main thing, the
size of the compressed file is more important, and as Atomik is the best
I'd choose that one before the others, even if you have to wait about 15
times as long :)

                          2.2      2.3      3.6     2.40

Size                |  304kb |  184kb |  307kb |  325kb |

Here we can see that sentry isn't the fastest one, but it sure has the
best compress ratio! There isn't a very big difference between Sentry2.2,
Atomik3.6 and ICE-pack 2.40, they all end up a little bit above 300kb,
out of 410kb. A pretty good number you say, nope.. not compared to
Sentry2.3! And it is also very fast!

Conclusions:
------------
The only improvments from version 2.2 seems to be the added routines for
compressing samples, but what a difference!
Compared to the other packers Sentry still doesn't compress executeable
files as good as Atomik or ICE-packer but it sure does it WAY faster.
It does however a great job to samples and modules.
For exectuteable file I will still use Atomik or ICE-packer, as they
compress better, processing modfiles is another thing though, here I will
most likely start using Sentry.


Disclaimer:
-----------
This review was done in a hurry, I didnt have no time to compress smaller
exec. files like 4k's and so, this is where it really shows if a packer is
worth using for demo-sceners.
The different packers gives you different default values for settings.
In this test I have used the suggestions given by the program (default),
that's why it might differ a bit if you "optimize" the settings for each
file to compress.

I have not rated this program as I really couldn't find a way to rate a
packer :)
