ñPacMan for GEMð by òMario Becroftð (óany Atarið) [1999]

Have you seen òTronð, the movie ? There, an evil program named óMCPð
appears (not óMSðP ? he he), the óMðaster óCðontrol óPðrogram, that
tries to get rid of a nasty supervisor programed very suitably named
óTronð (ótrðace óonð in most basic dialects) and fights users, owners
and other lamers in various shades of blue.
The funny part is that this óMCPð is supposed to have been a òChessð-
program before.
So if you ever wondered what ñWindowsð has been before, here is the
answer: It has been a òSolitaireð-game before.

Solitair. Hardly anyone plays it in real-life with a deck of cards and
yet millions and millions of bored Windows users played it for hours.
One freshly-born Windows 95 user even was delighted that he can now
finally send FAXes ñandð play Solitaire at once - which Micro$oft
claimed to be possible with Windows 3.0 already ...

Anyway, the reason for this overwhelming entry is simple that:
Windows 3.x was mainly intended for use on 12 MHz 286 to 25 MHz 386
when it was first released and Windows was - especially thanks to the
extremely simple board-design of those machines - far too slow for
serious kinds of games.
ñGEMð on the other seems not to be too slow for Arcade games. òDirkð
òHagedornð proved it with ñCentipedeð and now òMario Becroftð brings us
ñGEM-PacManð.
( The bus-design of the average PC stayed relatively simple and boring
btw, just the oscillator crystals have been replaced by 100 MHz ones
now instead of 8 MHz).

Enough of that Windows-bashing (can there ever be enough ?) - let's talk
about this ñPacManð for game.
òMario Becroftð, currently located in New Zealand, author of this game
and some other funky gadgets, is a modest guy: He recommends to run this
game only on a machine equal to the óFalconð or higher, but the minimum
requirement is a resolution around 640 x 400 in various numbers of colours.

Once you launched ñPacMan for GEMð, you get a Menu-bar and the window
you play it in. The cursor-keys can be used for controlling ñPacManð but
the mouse stays active all the time.
Starting a new game usually enables you to select which level to start in
and there are a ólotð of levels.
What follows then is basically ñPacManð.
Eat all the dots.
Don't get eaten by the ghost(s).
Eat a Powerpill to eat ghost(s) instead - for a while.

In case this is too confusing for you, there are also some nice Solitair-
like games for GEM. ;-))))
Just kidding, i think everybody knows ñPacManð.
So let's come to the technical aspects of it. Obviously, the game doesn't
require a Falcon or even a more advanced machine. It runs very fine on a
simple ñSTð in óST-Highð-resolution.
Although PacMan moves a little jumpy then, the average speed is still okay,
even in higher levels with more ghosts.
The game even runs fine on a Colour-monitor and a simple ñSTEð as long as
you run an óInterlaceð-program so you can have 640 x 400 pixels in 4 
colours. The game looks monochrome then, but the speed is still okay.
On a ñFalconð or a ñTTð, the game gets more colourful. ñPacManð is really
yellow then and the ghosts get coloured, too.
The speed can vary then a little - according to the machine you run it on,
but in the best case, the movements just get a little smoother.
If you run the game on an ñSTEð or better, you even get òDMAð-Sound Effects
that sound quite good, too.
The game runs fine under ñMagiCð and it also seems to run fine on a
ñMultiTOSð-like setup like for example ñMiNT+N.AESð. It also runs as
a (memory-consuming) accessory for all you ñSingleTOSð-fanatics out there.

The levels are not all the time symmetric and the number of ghosts vary.

The game is of course no replacement for ñPacMan on Eð, òCrackmanð or
even the famous óCrapManð, but it doesn't try to be. In case you have a
multitasking environment and would like to play an Arcade game óonð your
desktop once in a while, this is for you.
Since it will most probably also run on the clones ñHadesð and ñMilanð,
it's so far one of the very few games those people can play.
And it's quite some fun. Although it is rather aimed at the ñnostalgicð-
òPacMan-playersð, the leveldesign is well done in most cases, the speed
is okay, the ghosts intelligent and the overall gameplay rather fair.
It surely won't attract ñGEMð-haters and it definetly won't attract
ñPacManð-haters either, but for those that like a good round of ñPacManð
once in a while, it is a good game.
