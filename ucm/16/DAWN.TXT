    I just happened  to be on IRC  that day  when I noticed  the topic ó"new STAXð 
ódemo released"ð. Amazed at the  news I hoped to grab a cool demo but what I found 
is definitely ñ* NOT *ð a cool demo. Gore  lovers  will  surely have  recognized a 
wellknown  movie from the  title  above and  it is  what this "demo" is about, a 
tribute to the funny movie by Romero  òDAWN OF THE DEADð  in which the living dead 
roam the streets in search of food, understand brains (all gore lovers know that 
living dead feed  on our  brains 8-). Some ppl love  this kind of  film and some 
hate it, personally I think it's  quite funny to see blood and guts spill around 
this way but I'd óneverð would have dedicated a demo to it, anyway...

    Load the prg and wait. The screen  fades to red and a  green monster face is 
displayed with a  small 'loading' beneath. Then  you get an old fashioned module 
with old instrument samples and it sounds damm ñridiculousð (but it fits the topic 
right). A small  and average STAX logo  follows up. Then we get some text with a 
big red font (the bottom of the letters seems  to be made  of bloodlets) warning 
that the creatures from  Hell are  getting  closer... Bouh ! What  scared me was 
mostly the ugly  green and red  "Dawn of the Dead" logo ;-) After this  poor and 
óuninteresting  introductionð  we reach the  main  part. Cool it's  another boring 
slide show ! At last it uses the enhanced palette of the Ste even though it only 
displays shades of grey 8-( You will be offered - lucky you ! - tons of pictures 
taken from the movie and sometimes some  animations like a living dead snatching  
a piece of flesh from his victim or stuff like that. Some pictures are crappy as
you don't even manage to know what  you are looking at ! The  whole slideshow is 
unfortunately very  long  and - logically - óvery boringð. No need to mention that 
you can watch it endlessly or reboot...

    òBottom Lineð : the year is 1999 if you remember right and I hoped we could at 
least get rid of this  sort of slide show but hell proved I was wrong. Bod ñdaredð 
do it and so the result is a òboring,ðó lameð  slideshow based on a  ñfunny movieð. If 
you are a living dead fan and  collect any piece  of shit around then you can go 
blindfold otherwise don't even download it, ñit's just a waste of time.ð
