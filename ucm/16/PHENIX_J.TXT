* CLASS4-CENTEK  NEWS for APRIL-MAY-JUNE *
*************************************************************

Here is a short brief about what we've been doing last three months...

- CENTEK & CLASS4 teams have joined together in a brand new 21000
square-feet  work space .

------------------
SOFTWARE
------------------

- A SQL core (data-base) was realised by a student who spent three months
  towards CLASS4.

- Dolmen's ressource (RSC) editor named "FASHION" , one of the major parts of
  our developper package has been widely enhanced and is very likely to make
  us do a quantum leap regarding to the look&feel of our softwares, by the
  intensive use of really NEW objects.

- Two students are actually busy developping a BSD based network system layer.

- PCI-DMA has been tested (used by Ultra-SCSI, Ultra-DMA 33, DSP56301,
  USB, also by the graphic card , or even by a network card).

- Dolmen's DOS layer now handles properly PC drives (including FAT32
  drives). Such drives may have a size of more than 1000 GB (in fact
  nearly infinite because it's simply larger than the largest hard
  diskdrive !).

- Handling of a proprietary vector fonts manager compatible with
  QUICKDRAW GX 32-Bit.

- Convertor system from TRUETYPE 2 & GX formats to the internal format.

- Conversion of the 16-Bit coordinates VDI to 32-Bit (like QUICK DRAW GX).

- The VDI of DOLMEN is actually modified to become compatible with NVDI 4
  (NVDI 5 compatibility is studied).

- Evolution of the FLASH loader program (actual name is PUTFLASH) for the
  PHENIX 060's FLASH updates (the FLASH is sectorized and the write access
  is protected by a password).

- Handling of some MAGIC AES objects for better compatibility.

- WDIALOG functions being implemented (see reason above)

- SCSI, IDE & ATAPI devices can now receive the same commands, CECILE does
  all required translation.

- GDOS & SPEEDOGDOS fonts are now used by Dolmen's AES.

- Some picture file formats have been added in GPIX aes objects :
  .RAS (Sun raster file)
  .WMF (Windows Metafile)

- Cecile's CD player now grabs cd tracks in WAV format for better compatibility.
  (handles different grabbing speeds with jitter control).

- A professional CD recording software has just been started.

- Set up of our OPENGL (1.2) rendering kernel in Dolmen.

- Study of the DMX communication protocol.

-------------------
HARDWARE
-------------------

- Optimised routage of the motherboard near the 20-bit AUDIO parts, and
  on the  PCI & IDE bus

- Added a HE14 connector for 2 fans (one for each 060).

- Added a double programmable-PLL to select bus speed by software
  (local 060 bus up to 90 MHz & PCI bus up to 50 MHz).

- Debugging of the arbitration logic for the 7 PCI agents.

- Added 5Vcc supply on CPU#B's slot (named SLOT B).

- Increased capacity of 32-Bit FLASH memory from 256 KB up to 1 MB
  (expandable to 2 MB).

- Tweaks on demand of the motherboards mounter regarding to the size
  of the pads for the 2.2 uF & 10 uF SMT capacitors.
