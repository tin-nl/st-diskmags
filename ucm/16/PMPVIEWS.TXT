
         I said goodbye to the river ... the mountains and the trees
        can't you hear they are singing their song of birth and agony

                 many words...  many dreams I've got to give

           I said goodbye to the seasons that were never insincere
        bye myself I am singing their song  that no one wants to hear

                 many words...  many dreams I've got to give
              but in this racing world there is no place for me
                and when I leave today  óNO MEMORIES REMAINð...

[first day]

Huh, were should I start?  The whole journey  was an odyssey.  I left my  little
village at around 10 o'clock in the morning on friday the 30th of july and drove
to Wiesbaden  city where I joined  Mad Butscher on the travel to coffeeshopland.
At around 12:30 we left Wiesbaden.  The weather was hooooooooot. There were some
traffic jams and it all lasted much  longer than we  expected.  When we  finally
arrived at Utrecht,  where the party where held,  we drove around like crazy but
couldn't find the  partyplace...  man what's was going on???  Suddenly  when  we
surely were on the wrong way we met Creature XL driving behind us... MAN!!  That
was crazy and something we never expected at all! After another while of driving
around we parked our cars  and  walked in the  park and...  THERE IT WAS... very
well hidden with a big Atari-banner placed at the entrance.  When we entered the
place at around 30 people where there.

Guys from Checkpoint, Foundation 2, Paranoia,  Classic Atari magazine, Sector 1,
Exa, Loud,  Fun (of course),  Teenage, Torment, Maggie Team (Arnel) and Wildfire
were there.  All the usual  Atari machines  could be found there: 800 XL, ST and
Falcon.  I just got a copy of  PIE BILL GATES which I waited for about a year to
see it.

Frost showed me a preview of the intro for the next Cream production, which will
be a universal amiga music player. It seems that some of the guys are working on
small demos.  
 
Exyl/Sector 1 gave me a look on some screens of his  upcoming demo and it looked
quite promising. EarX/Fun was working on a  module compile for  Falcon featuring
lotsa mods by Comp7 and D-Force.


and now a little interlude:

[second day]

Uuuhm, next morning. I slept quite well on the leather couch :-).  Later the day
the room really  got  full and  everyone was  doing something.  The deadline for
music and gfx-compos were at  18:00 o'clock  in the evening. Someone was playing
YMCA all the time... and it sucked! :-)

Richard Karsmakers appeared at the party in the late evening. Great. When it got
darker outside they put on the campfire. Man this really felt good.  Imagine all
the atarians sitting around a fire in the dark night and  talking  about atarian
oddities of the past. It felt like home.

Later on at around  24:00 o'clock the first  competitions were held.  There were
the Soundchip, 4Channel and Multichannel music compos aswell as the 16colour gfx
competition with mostly good entries. Right after that I went to bed.

Note:  I MISS THE NAMES OF THE PRODUCTIONS IN HERE!  DOES  NOBODY  WHO  ORGANIZE
A PARTY IN THE ATARISCENE CAN DO THAT COMPLETE???



[At last]

Finally  I  can say that this event was really worth the travel to Holland and I
will do it again for sure if I can afford it.  The only negative  point was  the
very high entrance fee of 50 guilders which is 23 Euro which is 46 german marks.
The EIL entrance fee was 30 german marks... So compare by yourself! 


Keep on partying.
