ñTiny Toonsð by òtnbð (óFalconð) [Error in Line'99 release]

We're tiny, we're toony, we're all a little loony ... Well, that
doesn't only fit the ñTiny Toonsð, famous cartoons series by Warner Bros.
with òSteven Spielbergð being the official producer, that also fits the
Atari scene and especially the guys from tnb (no offense. If someone
from Paranoia calls someone else insane, it's ñneverð an offense).
At least this demo suggests that they are.

Additionally, some people at Konami have been quite loony as well, but in
a very depressing way. They decided that the ñTiny Toonsð-TV series were
so good, colourful, cheerful and funny that it deserved a ñgameð on the puny
8-bit black/white console ñGameBoyð, better knows as óLameToyð so you can
carry it around all the time, get on the nerves of the one you sit next to
in the bus and have your eyes get funny while trying to see if there's 
actually something moving on the screen or if it's just the batteries 
fading.
The reason i mention this here is: This demo emulates the game ñTiny Toonsð
or at least the òGameBoyð-version of it.

Whoops, i just forgot, this is a ófake-demoð so of course it does òNOTð
emulate the game.
It just displays the òGameBoyð-display (including the grey frame around it
with the battery LED), the more or less original title screen and plays
a mod that sounds very similar to the original òGameBoyð-music.
When the music is finished or you press a key, you get a couple of bombs
and that's basically it.

So how to rate this ?
This demo is neither a good laugh nor is it very long-lasting. This demo
did not require a lot of design because basically, everything was done by
òKonamið before and the program to get it all on screen basically consists
of a ñModplayer-routineð and a routine to diplay a picture on the Falcon -
which is really not ñthatð hard.
I agree, ófake-demosð usually don't rely on effects heavily and i also
agree that most of them are no good laugh either and are not very long-
lasting as well.
The basic idea of this is some kind of original, nobody ever programmed
a "fake-emulator" before, but once you've seen it, you delete it.
