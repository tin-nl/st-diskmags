This article could be entilted as ñ"The lost reviews of UCM 15 part 1"ð,  coz this
compile was released long before the òError In Lineð convention and intended to be
reviewed for óUCM15ð as well as lotsa other  reviews from which  I thought ñMoondogð
has already done them. Ok, enough of this. Let me start.

This Disk runs only on STE, so if you only have a normal  STF you can forget it.
The  intro  features  some vertical  scrolling of the  screen and  a  horizontal
scrolltext with the usual gossip,  credits and all that stuff. In the upper part
of the screen a Depression-logo of low quality if beeing displayed and under the
scrolltext another textdisplayer with the greetings can be found. Well overall a
very common intro which is sufficent for the job.

After pressing space you reach the desktop where you can load the  player, which
is to be precise the  ñSirius-playerð by ótSCcð. On the disk there can be found five
modules from five different composers.  The mods are packed with ñICE!ð which is a
good sign (you have followed my suggestion, eh? :-). Now for the tunes.


ñ[505 - Virgin Lands 1]ð

This module features two different parts. It starts off as a kind of very chilly
endpart-alike-tune  and  after  a  while  it turns into a fast old amiga-stylish
module comparable to some tunes from various amiga demos some years ago.


ò[Ace/Palace - Terminator 1 tune..]ð

This tune seems to be the filler-tune for  the  disk, coz it's so small in size.
Well, the tune itself is a cover-version from the theme from ñTerminatorð and it's
a real bad one. If you compare the  original tune  with this,  the cover-version
sound  totally  wrong.  The  notes  are wrong chosen  and sound slanting. If you
really want a good  ñTerminatorð-mod  then get  ótSCc-Module  compilation 2ð,  which
contains a brilliant cover-version by òANDI/ICAð!


ó[Comp7/Bassment - Tranceducer]ð

Known for his tunes for last  year's óFUNð demo and òMOLE MAYHEMð, óComp7ð of òBassmentð
has done another tune for the  scene. This time  it's a kind of  technoid-trancy
tune with a nice "Is that good for you?"-sample.  After  a while a  really funky
blues-alike melody comes up and after a break the bassdrum changed  to a  harder
kickin' one.


ñ[Perkele/Depression - Lite]ð

This one start off with a nice piano part... but then really unexpected it turns
into a crossover-metal-module with really rough metal guitars with strange...ehm
... very strange... melodies at all. At the end it turns back to  the piano-part
from the beginning... I like this part the most. It's relaxing...


ó[Toodeloo/DHS - People (totalgoa)]ð

What should  I  say? This  is common-óToodelooð-GoaTrance in a high quality, as we
know it from ñToodelooð. Very acidic basslines and a  thousand times recycled "You 
make me feel so good"-Sample do the rest.



ñCONCLUSIONð: A very fine collection of exclusive  and previously  unreleased mods
can be found on this compilation. Except one module, all the tunes are in a high
quality  standard.  Only negative  point is that they  use a 11 SECTOR formatted
disk!!!  BAD IDEA guys!  You will sooner or later recognise that the data is not
save on such a disk!  The disk will surely FUCK UP sometime! This compile surely
doesn't reach  nowadays standard of some other crews but it's a good start where
you can build up things.

Keep it up.
