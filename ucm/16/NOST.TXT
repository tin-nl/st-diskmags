On start up we're greeted with a "Union like intro". Multicoloured wavy text,
all borders broken (well, the top isn't be I think it should be) and a 
vertically scrolling background. This then slides off the side and an Oxygene
logo fades in by Niko, which is damn cool.

Now you get a second intro...


                        ñYou all think it was a joke...ð
                           ñ(even we think it was !)ð
                        ñbut now, the dream comes trueð
                        ñ(an Oxygene dream of course...)ð

The text above fades in/out line by line and now for the first impressive bit..
A backwards flyby 3D flat-shaded triangle landscape. This flashes into 
wireframe with brief credits, just who was involved, and then back to the 
flat-shading. 

Next is the load screen, a dot-board showing the title of the screen and 
credits, as it shows the progress at the bottom of the screen.

A great metallic monstrosity drops down to the ground, he's called Charly. 
We're on the main menu screen, fullscreen once again (I really think there's 
something wrong with my top border), an 8x8 font scroller gives credits and 
some more info like the 10 sector 82 track disk has ñ2.2Mbð of compressed data on
it, and how to control our friend Charly, arrow keys, and bashing space to 
enter the screens.

And if necessary there is a backup menu, just press Undo, for if your using an
emu and you can't get fullscreen or if you can't find one of the screens.

òDots Revengeð
ò------------ð
Starting with a gray-scale pic by Mon ñ6475ð dots start flying around the screen.
Or that's what Leonard says in the scroller, while a chip tune plays. After 
pressing space you then get to see ñ1250ð real-time-dual-sinus dots, which you 
can mess around with by pressing F1-F8, 1-8 and F9 & F10.

òSprite and Parallaxð
ò-------------------ð
A Big BBC logo floats around the screen in this one as well as a small bit of 
text, while the two bits of the background shift around too.

òLemmings Colourshockð 
ò--------------------ð
A large blocky scroller goes along, saying how boring it is then then adding
bit by bit, colour, music, a rotating coloured bar, a logo with glow, "VU-meter
rastars, the background then changes into a dot board followed by the scroller 
into it, then the background changes into loads of Lemmings which nuke 
themselves... need I go on with this... bash a key and you get a verticle 
credit scroller in a biscuit font.

òFullscreen Rotozoomð
ò-------------------ð
A rotozoomer sits in the middle of a borderless screen with "Peylow Rules" 
floating around over it, at the top is a wavy toys logo and three different 
verticle scrollers going by on each side.

òFractal Blastð
ò-------------ð
2.6 sec standard Mandlebrot in 320x256 wow, very fast and colourful too.

ò3D Texture Mappingð
ò------------------ð
This has to be my favorate screen on the disk...
A 3D cube approaches the front of the screen, on 2 sides are South Park 
characters, one is Dameon (I can't spell I think)  Satan's son in it :) The 
cube then spins round and then dissolves away with a flame like effect, and 
you can still see the texture in the flame.
Various other objects like skulls/faces, houses, cigarette packets are also
displayed.
Now they start showing off more, rotozooming the texture on the cube. A few 
more objects and then the fix the textures' position so it warps around the 
next few objects as they move and turn.
Now you get Kenny from South Park, who waves and rolls his head side tio side 
and also rocks on the floor and after a while his head falls off and you get a
sampled "Oh my god you killed Kenny! You bastards!" playing out your speakers.
Oh and you also get the credits and greeting while the end bit with Kenny goes
on.

ò3D Cubeð
ò-------ð
This is a clone of the Amiga Phenomena screen. A 3D cube with various different
objects also spinning around on the surfaces.

òSIDCOMð
ò------ð
Listen too all those Union Demo tunes, that's the only reason to be on this 
screen. An old piece of graphics for the background by Agent -T- and that's 
it for this screen.

òJoke Guest Screenð
ò-----------------ð
A giant scroller by TCB (but that's the joke as it isn't) with disorting blue 
dots in the background with thumping ravish music.

òSprite Blastð
ò------------ð
What a load of balls :) 32 in fact floating round in a snake like way with a 
giant fullscreen scroller bouncing along in the background.

òLED-Copyð
ò--------ð
Well it's got it's own copier with An LED scroller and VU-meter.

òThe Creditsð
ò-----------ð
This uses an HTML-like interface and has more of those dots floating around,
once again controlable like in the dots screen. All the credits are in here
and all the greetings, info on most of the screens, how that ñ2.2Mbð was got onto
the disk and so on.

òReset Screen
ò------------
ñ726ð 4x4 pixel balls spin around the screen as a cube, which twists, turns, 
warps and generally changes shape, with a TAO tune in the background.

That looks like it's all, maybe some of you are wondering why I haven't said a
word about it being nostalic. Well most of the older demos like this I haven't
seen and those I have I only watched this year, as I'm newer to the scene and
hadn't seen any Atari demos before then (only a few PC ones).

Overall I'll give it ñ87%ð, maybe it'd be different if I'd seen older stuff...
