ñMaggie 27ğ by òThe Maggie Teamğ [óFalcon/STğ] (early 1999)

Once again, it's time to review another diskmag. Not that this would
be great fun, but in contrast to the magazine reviewed we take our
competition serious and dedicate a few words to them (actually, there's
not a single F*CK YOU! in this ... whoops ... ) so they know how we
rate them.

Here goes.

The óSTğ-shell is a joke ... still.
Yes, it's the same old shell that gives all óSTğ-users the impression
of being the neglected part of the òAtariğ-community.
Basically, all articles are there ... Well, so it's functional and does
what it is supposed to do but really not a single bit more.

The óFalconğ-shell is a bit better. Although basically the same as before,
it is much more comfortable, has a nice background picture by òRipleyğ which
looks a little like finished in a hurry ... Can it be ? With ñthisğ delay ?
If not, just skip my sentence above.
There's also some music by òsh3ğ being played which is nice and harmonic, 
but tends to sound a little too repetitive though.

But no one reads a diskmag to listen to music or watch nice background-
graphics so let's get to the articles because there's quite a lot of
them. As usual, i will not get into every detail though.

ñEditorialğ
The usual stuff. Nice ...

ñSceneğ
ñNewsğ feature the well known ñMaggieğ-news, just not as many as usual
and of course quite outdated by now.
ñDirkğ talks about the news in the rest of the world as well. A bit
lengthy but with all the news, you just skip the uninteresting parts.
ñFeaturesğ feature stuff about ñEIL'99ğ which was in the far future
when this article was written, ñNUT's SCSI-Ethernetğ ... ehem ...
and the usual ñcharts and awardsğ. Hmm ... ñMaggie-Chartsğ still make
we wonder. òBest Nintari-gameğ is still in there, the number of places
mentioned is ridiculous all through the charts (about 100 10th and 11th
places for òbest ST gameğ etc. Well, not really important but i remember
someone saying that certain editors of certain diskmags should put more
emphasis on details like the òchartsğ, so this would be a good place to
start.

ñGamesğ
The reviews are of the usual ñMaggieğ-quality. They tend to be a little
too long, but they are worth it as they go into several aspects of the
reviewed games and give a fair and well-based rating, although ñMaggieğ
usually rates games too good, just like i do.
Reviewed are ñBreakdance, Bunion Canyon, Crackman, GEM PacMan, Raidenğ and
the ñstupid baloon gameğ. All reviews are fair and well-researched.
Additionally, you find something about the end-sequence of ñChuck Rockğ,
which is not only a not-funny article, but also a not-interesting at all
article. There is also òMatt Smith'sğ excellent ñRunningğ-guide which
is really worth every line. Excellent !
This category is closed by an article named "Where are they now ?" about
promised games for the ST that were never released. Funny enough, most
of the games mentioned here totally flopped on the systems they were
released for so i really can't think of any reasons why i should miss
them on the ST. Anyway, this article is signed (C) 96, so i guess it's~
not exactly meant to be the highlight of the issue.
Well, one more review about the Lynx' version of PacLand ... Nothing
to say about this, PacLand is one of the worst games i have ever seen
so i can't understand why it's being reviewed but i guess that's a
matter of taste or completing a collection.
Overall, the ñgames-departmentğ is one of the highlights of ñMaggieğ
again. Fair and well-written reviews although not very critical, but
encouraging to read and an excellent ñRunningğ-guide.

ñDemosğ
Usually, this is another highlight of ñMaggieğ as well ...
And also, as usual, òMr.Pinkğ's reviews tend to get a little bit óveryğ
long in some cases. Nevertheless, the reviews are again based on good
research, really catch every aspect of the reviewed product where it's
worth it and gets into details about the rating as well which makes each
article transparent and nice to read.
This issue features reviews about a lot of ñ128-byters by NoCrew and
Checkpointğ - none by the Reservoir Gods, ñBinlinerğ, an excellently written
review for an excellent preview, the ñEIL'99-invitation demosğ, a nice,
because ironical, article about ñFake-demosğ, furthermore about ñfluğ,
ñFungle Beatsğ, ñGeneration Gapğ, ñIllness at Nightğ, the ñ4ktrosğ from
the òQuaSTğ-party, about the demos from òRTSğ, ñTeardrop Plusğ,
ñBack in Franceğ, ñDo thingsğ, ñNostalgic-oğ and ñSometimes Bumblebees...ğ.
This list seems endlessly long but with 2 issues a year, a lot of releases
sum up to be reviewed. Funny enough, most of the reviews are indeed written
with some dedication so if the òMaggie Teamğ wrote some of these reviews
in a hurry, they disguised that very well.
Except for the fact that ñMaggieğ is again a little bit short on criticism,
the ñdemoğ-department is one of the best parts of it.

ñUtilitiesğ
They tested ñCentScreenğ and ñCentinelğ and the ñCentinelğ review
tends to be a bit dry and too technical, it's more a tutorial than
a review, but on the other hand, it's a òdebuggerğ and that's not
only hard to review, but the technical details are necessary for the
review. The ñCentscreenğ-review is nice and short though.
Besides those, ñEnchantğ, ñFlaySIDğ and the ñMegaPlayerğ are being
looked at and those reviews are okay, nothing to get wild about, but
informative and objective.

ñCommercial placeğ
As usual, adds from òSystem Solutionsğ and òTitan/Core/Cortex Designğ.
Also an add for the ñSCSI bursterğ.

ñSilli.nesğ
A lot of jokes, entertaining and maybe funny article, but unfortunately,
they miss the target. Most of the articles here are rather boring and
a bit useless, the usual reaction after reading is mostly confusion, not
entertainment. Would you like to read Mr(s). MaP(ink)les hunt for Jam
Butty ? Me neither ... Sorry to rate this department this way, but if
that's what delayed this issue so much, it should have been skipped.

ñFeaturesğ
Hmm ... A nice article about ñAtari loveğ ... I remember having read
such an article in a previous issue of ñUCMğ as well ... ;-)
Nevertheless, this is article is worth reading for all people who
have a tendency to nostalgism.
Further, the movie ñSaving Private Ryanğ is being reviewed as well
as a select list of other movies from 1998 in a rather short way.
Interesting maybe for people who do not go to movies before they
haven't been reviewed in an Atari-diskmag ... Although i see that
this is a standard column in ñMaggieğ, with this issue being delayed
that much, reviewing movies is quite pointless. I assume ñSavingğ
ñPrivate Ryanğ has been available on video already the time ñMaggie 27ğ
was released.
Some ñmusicğ is being reviewed and there's a ñdiskmag roundupğ. Nice,
short, tasty information about other diskmags, short and precise.
Just one thing to wonder about ... ñUCMğ isn't mentioned anywhere.
Is ñUCMğ really that bad ?
The category closes with an ñAtari CD-ROMğ being tested as well as
some ñmusic demosğ.

ñInterviewsğ.
One with òIan Bellğ one of the 2 creators of ñEliteğ (Bell & Braben)
and one with òMarcerğ from òEliteğ. Both are interesting to read and
well done. Definetly good work.

ñHardwareğ.
Guess what. Yes, of course, òMr.Pinkğ's dreammachine is being reviewed.
Although not even half-done by the time this was written, the òPhenixğ
is being reviewed along with the òmouse bursterğ, the òPhenix 3D acc.ğ,
the òPSX 2ğ, a way how to fix an òSM 124ğ is shown along with an
article about a òTechnics CD Playerğ.
Well, it's obvious to see òMr.Pink'sğ fascination about the òPhenixğ.
Although the 2 articles could have been combined, there's nothing wrong
with that. These 2 articles are well done, just a little long and maybe
outdated by the time of release. The others are good, too, i just don't
understand the guide about the òTechnics CD-Playerğ ... Will ñMaggieğ
starts to review coffee-machines next issue ?

ñIn-boxğ
This time, a few lines from òShiuming Laiğ and òJody Smithğ have reached
the òMaggie-Teamğ. The 2 mails from òShiumingğ are interesting, informative
and also fun to read while the stuff from òJody Smithğ is a bit ... weird.

ñMaggie visits ...ğ
Correspondents all over the world, ñMaggieğ reports from America, the UK
Atari show and several other places. Not bad, but nothing to get wild
about. The óAmericağ-article is far too long for what is being said in
it, the others are entertaining and informative.

ñInternet-stuffğ
News from óAtari.Orgğ and the òNatureğ-homepage being reviewed.

ñProgrammingğ
Two articles from òMr.Pinkğ, one very complete tutorial about the òFPUğ,
another, shorter one, about the òVidelğ, both are very detailed and
therefore a good reference.
Another 2 texts from òtoodelooğ, they are very short this time.

And that's basically all there is. Quite a lot, especially a lot of
reviews, which definetly are one of ñMaggie'sğ strong points. So here
comes the óResumeeğ.
This issue of ñMaggieğ suffers from one ómajorğ illness: Delay.
It came far too late for the information it offers. Although that
doesn't affect the excellent reviews much, one of the most important
aims to have a diskmag, to spread ònewsğ no one has heard of before, 
is not really fulfilled here. The points i usually criticise a bit
when reviewing ñMaggieğ like articles being too long or a bit
pointless, are present as well, so one could call it an average
issue of ñMaggieğ. If it had been released a little earlier, it would
have been indeed a good issue that followed the standards, ñMaggieğ
itself set, very well.
With most of the news being out-dated and most of the games/demos
having been reviewed somewhere else often enough, this issue is not
that hot anymore.
On the other hand, the level of the english being used is very high
again, as in almost every issue, there's some few snapshots of 
the typical dry british humour. The highlights of this issue surely
are the reviews and Mr.Pink's 2 tutorials, the sili.nes section
surely is the downpart of this issue.

Unfortunately, just an average issue of ñMaggieğ.
Better luck next time. ;-)
