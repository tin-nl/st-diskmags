ñStreet Figther 2ð by òPatrice Mandinð (óFalcon)ð [Update]

Now also featured on Patrice's almost daily updated homepage.
He obviously didn't like the óAtari STð-version of ñStreet Fighter 2ð,
although this is one of the better computer conversions of arcade games
as far as i can see it, graphics and sounds are okay, movement and
control of the sprites is not bad and the background graphics are more
colourful than on the óAmigað - most of the time.
Nevertheless, òPatriceð obviously didn't like it and compared to the
óSuperNintendoð-version, i have to admit that the óSTð-conversion does
look poor.
So òPatriceð decided to more or less ñemulateð the óSNESð-version on 
the òAtarið.
So far, there are 2 versions. One in B/W that runs on the simple óSTð
and one in colour that requires a óFalconð and an óRGBð-monitor.
Both only offer the actual òfightð, no òmenuð, no òsoundð and only
óChun Lið twice in a ò2 playerðmode. Only possible control is the òjostickð
and 6 keys on the keyboard for
- soft kick
- medium kick
- hard kick
- soft punch
- medium punch
- hard punch.
The original òarcade-machineð had 6 buttons as well.
Both versions move the sprites nicely and scroll in a way that you get
a ò3dimensional illusionð of the scenery.
No òknockoutð or ògame-overð-sequence exist yet.

The óSTð-version is too slow to play on a simple ó8 MHz STð, but okay
on a óMega STEð or óFalconð. The óFalconð-version on the other hand is
slick enough to play, even on óstandard Falconsð, although a òlittleð
uncomfortable sometimes.

I don't know why òPatriceð wants to emulate ñStreet Fighter 2ð from the
óSNESð on an óAtarið as i didn't consider the óSTð-version that bad - 
on the contrary, i played it with òDer Komturð lots of times - but all
in all, this looks promising. So far, the speed is okay for an emulation
and the controls react well.
Let's see how this develops, it had a good start.
