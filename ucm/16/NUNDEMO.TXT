
         This is a total war, ladies and gentlemen,  inside a system
                          Outside somewhere the law
                  This is a final call so, uh, take a stand
        Choose your side of the wall, I did, you know what I'm sayin'

                  I am an artist, so I must make -n- create
            Then dictate the rhyme that fits the break bass,  yes
                      I am the one the lord got blessed
                   S failed there was 6  I passed the test
                   That's why the god son luv 1's the only
                   One luv one corrispondin  wid the drums
               Villian to some, but their assumption are minor
                this black man took a  stand now he's climber
               Climbing the ritious mountain  of the knowledge
                   Many lack -n- want but  can't hold back
                  The hands of time you can replay my rhyme
             Listen light don't get too  heavy -n- bite alright!
              If you're a dancer dance,  now you got the chance
               I am here you are there,  there's no difference
           The only difference I'm getting paid for what I'm doing
                 'yoh how you livin' I'm  livin large coolin
           Showin -n- provin I got the knack which no one else got
                   My beat's the pipe my rhyme is the rock
                 So stop! I am the lover brother from around
                   The way this!  'Soon you will discover'
                   That this is a  countdown in simulation
         It's an um! Breakdown megabite  situation you know what I'm
               sayin somewhere in a war on disk in ROM and RAM
        Destroy the enemy and all  that stuff you know what I'm sayin
                 This is the next verse made by me the first
          master Luv 1 I've already  heard it to you it's the first
              But to suckers it's a hearse  coz their're cursed
                  Traverse to the desert -n- die for thirst
             This is not fiction it's true fact that I'm speakin
                    Boys weaken when the Luv 1's preachin

           The knowledge and wisdom  in the form that will let you
             Get up to the beat while the  doperhyme affects you
            yeah! Why you be playin the role.  Suckers I'm talkin
            now, I am biend to search -n- seak you out slayin the
           biters and the weak writers told! Don't bring them back
          war don't want no survivors,  so the method I use is this
                    a microphone and a bag  fullah tricks
            but get brave -n- step to me, while I'm playin loodie
           with the yardie boys up your  nose I'll shove the oozie
            so don't sneeze twitch or  get yourself a sudden itch
              or you'll be hurt serverly, by me not necessarily
             Thoughts amerge when they  do Luv 1 gets a grip of,
             the microphone then like a  jockey I skillfully sit
            on the rhythm like it is a black stallion  'go Luv 1'
              before the race would be the anthem cause I'm the
   m-a-s-t-e-r L-u-v number one ribious brother  'soon you will discover!'
             That this is a countdown to the final hour you know
           what I'm sayin. It's like um.  The breakdown -n- secret
        of power -n- stuff yoh you know what  the greed can do to man
                   the secrets in, the paradise programme.
          He prayed to god gave aims and thanks, entered the ladies
  power banks! Yeah it ain't the way it goes, Sanyo X was left to comatose.
                     I'mah break it down like yoh,  etc.
          The first time you hear my rhyme, you'll play it a second
          time. And if it's onah tape cassette, you'll press rewind
          The first paragraph flew past so damn quick all you could
                              say was 'oh dip!'
           Discribe myself,  just like chocolate candy sweet is my
             complexion,  dark brown eyes once you start flexing
        gold in my mouth,  the way it's formed is like a rock fade at
                          the sides, my eyebrow cut
                       5 ft 10 with an  athletes build
          you can build yoh body while you do I bill will to expose
                        The weak -n- help  the strong
             Yoh rhymes are limited bit I can  go on an on an on
                    like a battery better know as duracel
           I came from heaven to send you to hell -n-  by the way,
                        my name is G-O-D-S-O-N  Luv 1

         No remorse is the name of the album  aquired by words which
         I convert to paragraphs tappin like this.  To me Luv 1 is a
             simple taks so let us all participate onah hype tip
          you make up a dance they see like then bite it.  I design
         the kind of words that blow yoh  mind raised from the soul,
         converted to rhymes in every aspect I'mah detect the sucker
           boy who's plexing with the micrphone than snap his neck
          or with a lyric or tow I'mah waste  you and if you're not
         home like a hit man I'll await  you but let's hope it never
         comes to that stage where one dies and the  survivor sees a
        brand new day for in my crib  there's no room for the violent
                    so cease, you ritious like me? Peace!
          Many put up a frount say their my friend -n- talk at back
          ah me. But it don't bother Luv 1 the lyric factory for if
         I let it bother me I am the dumb one -n- if you didn't know
                          I am the god son buss it!
                      Countdown heart  beat beatin fast
                      Breakdown show down comes at last
                    The holy stakes sought  secrets grand
                    Computered in the paradise programme.
           And logically decorded all -n- so we came upon the fall
                    As the age of knowledge  has now come
                       Sir Hi-Fi launched his eco-bomb
                           You know what I'm sayin

Oooooh FUCK!  Lock  at this   |   The songlyrics are bigger than  the article!!!
Another fakedemo hitted our lines at the ñIMP8000ð...  ehm,  btw this  is  another
part of the lost reviews from òUCM15ð.

After clicking the PRG-file the demo starts off with the well known cinemascope-
mode. In the lower  right  corner of the  screen a well done 'óNUNð-the force from
above'-logo  (which is far too good for a fake-demo)  fades in. The music starts
to play and sounds a bit like  gabba...  very familiar with the mods from I know
from  ñTinker/TNHð  ;-).  Hey,  but what's that? Real routs? Looks like true Line-
Vector-routines!  I guess the holy brotherhood from the vatican is far away from
the knowledge of doing fakedemos at all!

The now appearing Porno-picture got my attention really fast.  A wet girlie with
a DILDO in her WET PUSSY!  Gimme mO!  Then the real 'fake?' comes up...  A  ugly
written logo saying  'Hidden Feature'  appears over the nice  picture.  The nice 
òNUNð-logo from the beginning fades out and causes  a bug which  displays the logo 
in a  distorted  way. After some  seconds the demo exits very clean  to desktop.

The world needs this like the pope needs his DICK! So  the  next  words are  for 
those  guys who always complain about us using swear words. You are cowards! Why
don't you write under your real nicks, eh? Hey this is óUCMð and not the Computer-
Kindergarden! If you don't like this go to your Mother and cry!!!!!
