    Here is the  ñfirst STð  production  released  at òPMPð. It seems this party was 
very friendly in spite of the ñscarceð demos presented... Anyway Teenage brings us 
a raving tekno democlip that made it first at the demo compo (and so I can guess 
there were very few releases 8-)

    It is a parody of the wellknown series of óM Demosð by òthe Carebearsð. Once the 
prg launched  you are greeted  by an ugly  pink font  that reads "the  megahorny 
queerbears present... H Demo IV" then  it all  goes very fast. The soundtrack is  
highly ñtekno and hardcoreð  inspired in the  tradition of  Tinker's compositions.   
The music is more or  less pleasant, up to everyone's taste I suppose, but I was 
a little disappointed this time.

    As any other democlip it  features  loads of  animations and fx synchronized 
with the music and that  will be repeated at least a hundred times to  make sure 
your eyes, ears and brains ówon't surviveð this experience. According to Pheno the 
demo was coded in two days just for fun and in a way it makes me feel better.... 
Among the numerous effects to be seen - to the òoverdose !!ð - you'll find a video 
sequence of  poor quality with  two guys, the one  behind pretending to fuck the 
other (very funny I cannot stop laughing...), some 1 plan  pictures and some gfx 
taken from Crackman and  "hidden"  messages still displayed with that awful pink 
font. My fave fx are a magnified rotating  "Atari  Rules" with a  tiny  blurring 
effect and a blue keftale (looks more like a mere color cycling). 

    As usual it all goes very fast, in a  ñboring loopð, until the  greetings part 
and a NO sign then the torture is over 8-)

    óBottom Line :ð I was expecting much from PMP and was happily surprised to see 
a new ñ* Teenage *ð production but I  quickly changed my  mind. It is just another 
democlip and to be honest it  was somehow  ópainfulð to reload it for this review. 
Some people may find it amusing but I don't know why... Well if you are a fan of 
democlip and like to see  mimed sodomy  you can get this  demo otherwise I don't 
see much  interest in it. It  may be  a souvenir to  all PMP  partygoers  as the 
download page seems desperately òemptyð as far as demos are concerned...
