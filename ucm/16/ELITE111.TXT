*Name* = they popped up and disapeard 
I surley missed some peoples and so. But I wrote all those I remembered
and found in scrolls and mags where I have been searching.

   /////////////////// History of Elite \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

No Limits. New name for some members of the Empire prosecuted by the police,
They are quiet for some understable reasons. They just spread their cracks 
abroad on modems.

No Limits. Opened a Coding section called Synergy system Software.

Empire just disapears, but Nokturnal stays in elite and later on No Limits 
appears in elite.

Where also teknix stays in elite (ex.empire Memebers)


Ruthless ex.Awsome dude. joined Elite with his Compacts and had nice Slaggin 
wars against Genesis Inc. and many others

Ruthless was made for the scene. Here is some stuff he made he Released a 
Non-workin version of Ultima VI and he used and elite intro which says: 
"cracked by Magician of MCA", it also says on the intro that the original was 
supplied by KRS ONE and Gangster, There are also slaggings, against ICS. So he 
seem to try to make Elite look like lamers.. ??


SCSI, was the the swedish Section of elite before and the members was ex 
members of ICS: KRS One (Original supplier), Zaphod ( Hardware Freaker, 
Pyromaniac, ex-Syndicate member, And not so good cracker), Troed (also known as
Red Fox of Sync), who seem to help Zaphod with his cracking, but he got kicked. 
Zodiac, Illegal Exception from SOTE and WtP ex-Syndicate Member, Zuul, Zam 
Diesel and Viking X. This section was born to have problems.... They didn't 
share on originals and somebody released unfinished menus etc..

Middle of 1992. Zaphod and Red fox was kicked out of Scsi Late in 1992. Section 
ONE (ex SCSI) left Elite

And in end of 1992 a union was planned against ICS Members was : Elite, Fuzion, 
Mad Vision, Replicants and Syndicate..

1992. Also Lowlife joined Hotline.

1992-1994

Members drops of and finaly there is more like just a few stays on for elite ST 
scene and elite becomes more like a normal crack band with lots of Sysops and 
coders/crackers.
        
Most leading crackers here are MCA, Hotline since they have the strongest bands
to elite, and the end of 1994.. it looks like the new division is taking over 
new names confront etc. like Void and Scorpio and Pervert. They started to hack 
stuff on the Falcon and Ste games and utilitys. Besides MCA always has been 
there. They even hacked Cubase Audio 1.0. But I believe that one was their last 
Audio midi crack. After Ishar 3, and CAF 1.0.. MCA disapear... Hotline in this 
time has also disapear and void (who seemed to be a nice utility/game cracker 
on Falcon) Just disapeard. Don't know. Maybe he changed his name to something 
else.. :) Don't know. But i would like to be contacted by him again if you read 
this! Email me : Marcer@algonet.se 

In late 1994 -	!! In Eye on Scene 1 !!.. They wrote.. Elite is now working 
mainly on SNES and only few members are working onto ST section now. They are 
not anyway cracking anymore on ST.

haha.. Wow.. not!?!

1994-95 is a not to much roumors in maggies anymore.. but it will be when UCM 
appears... not in ucm 1-6.. but...

1994-95 I marcer started to work together with Scorpio alot so I supplied him 
with stuff and he cracked them and so on the elite was producing. Since many 
members started to leave elite at this point many of the I don't know much 
about and I believe sledge is the only one who knows the true story about 
elite.

In middle of 1995 comes the reports of Sledge/elite will quit and even close 
his bbs for sure..

There was not a clear reson why. but as many others he might get bored of the 
scene (which was dying).

Stratagem took the replacement as a leader and the World HQ (night box).

Then this internal Fight began in Elite.. Stratagem closed his bbs (after a 
nice HD crash) and also gave the leadership to Faramir.

Stratagem left elite since he got a job which deserved all his time.

Faramir was workin well for elite, but the same time he involved his private 
interests in this. Which made elite to crash even more.. first Sledge leaving
and then Stratagem which was 2 big hands for Elite.

Faramir kicked away some member from the crew. and in the end there was only 4 
members left and no one did the crackin.

Since Zarmi, a well known name for elite, did everything to destroy elite's 
french section. which ended up with scorpio left elite. and mr. no, Static, 
Nikademus (only hacker left) was kicked by faramir. Pervert, Dr Byte Left elite 
since he didn't like faramirs way to role elite.

The old Elite-team was now on dead... 

Then Marcer (has become the WHQ bbs Sysop after Nightbox) started to check 
around for new crackers and he joined Orby with Faramir's Premission. that ended 
up a fight inside elite between Marcer & co vs Faramir. Wich made Faramir to 
decide to leave the crew and the (elite vs Vex war) ended.

Pervert Rejoind again and in short some new suppliers come to elite and now 
we started to do releases again for real.

UCM 8-10. had many nice infos about elite if you want to read about it again. 
Much happen in Elite since those releases of UCM :)

This is what I know and remember of elite.
