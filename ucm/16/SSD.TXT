    Last time Evil had  organized a cool ò< Online 4 Color Compo >ð and now we are 
presented with  the results of the ñSid Sound  Designer Compoð. As previously Evil 
took this opportunity to  code a little intro that  proves very pleasant. Please 
take not that the ó* lastest *ð version of this intro is named ó* ssmus12 *ð The two 
previous ones had some troubles running on STf machines and the key click wasn't 
turned off but this version runs ò100%ð

    It all starts with a ñstylishð white  font announcing that "DHS presents a new 
demo in July 99", the usual  stuff... Then the  black background fades to a nice 
brown while two - sort of - shadebobs spin over the name of the intro in a small 
window (maybe 160x100 hard to tell). But they're not the old fashioned shadebobs 
as they are made of ófireð. It's all òvery smoothð and the colors are great in other  
words Evil brings us a fast effect never seen before on ST. There is a flash and 
we get a DHS  logo with  the "shadebobs" still spinning  over  it. Note that the    
logo (also done  by  Evil) is of real ñgood  qualityð  too ! On top of  the screen     
appears the name of the chip  currently played with its composer name. The lower  
part of the screen shows  the list of other  tracks you can listen to from F1 to  
F10 in order of votes gained. We are also given 3 bonus chips and among them the 
introduction chip by DMA SC which is a really great remix of óWings Of Death !!ð

    The menu is ñvery well designedð, the fire "shadebobs" are still flying around 
and the overall quality of the musics is ógoodð. Of course you will find sidvoices 
by the usual ST talents such as Dma  Sc, MC Laser, Tao  and  505 but also  Evil, 
Viking, Baggio and others have contributed. We are thus offered a  wide range of 
styles and talents packed in a very eye catching package.

    ñBottom Line :ð a very  good production with  a great  fire  effect, a stylish 
presentation  all through the  intro to the  menu and a great  variety of musics 
(not to mention the remix of WOD by DmaSc !!). I will only criticize the lack of 
change in the route of the fire shadebobs which  may turn boring after 5 minutes 
but it's not a major  inconvenient. Again Evil shows his  ótalentsð (well you have 
seen his intro for this issue so you know what I mean). óSurely an intro to get !ð
