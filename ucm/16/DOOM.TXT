ñDoomğ v0.11 by òPatrice Mandinğ (óFalcon)ğ [Update]

I remember having written a lengthy introduction to ñDoomğ on the óFalconğ
in one of the previous issues of ñUCMğ so i'll cut a long story short
this time.
Everyone knows ñDoomğ. óPCğ users can play it, óAmigağ users can play it,
why should the óFalconğ users be spared out ?
That's what òPatrice Mandinğ aka òDatağ of òTrioğ must have been thinking
when he started working around the released source-code of ñDoomğ.
This finally gave the óFalcon-usersğ a playable version of Doom which has
been constantly been improved.

Now it reached ñversion 0.11ğ, using the original ñLinux Doom 1.10ğ
sources from òID Softwareğ themselves.
In the current version, ñDoomğ can play music using the ñSNDSERVğ-
soundserver which is a part of the ñHDIğ-project Patrice himself
initiated. ñHDIğ is supposed to be a òhardware libraryğ that other
programs can use/share so porting sourcecode from óLinuxğ or other
systems to the óFalconğ can be done easier and more efficient - 
after all, this worked fine on the óAmigağ-port of ñDoomğ.
Only disadvantage so far: The Soundserver needs a multitasking OS,
preferably òMiNTğ.
Additionally, ñversion 0.11ğ runs on the TT the first time - just
without sounds as the soundserver requires 16-bit audio - using
an ò8-bit-colourğ mode, resulting in ò256 coloursğ.

I really hoped for a speedup due to the reduction of colours but
unfortunately, that's not what happens. The ò8-bitğ-mode just
looks a bit uglier and that's it.
Although the Soundserver works really fine, ñDoomğ is just simply
to slow to play on a óstandard Falconğ, it's even an unbearable drag
on a óNemesis-Falconğ so using a óct2ğ-Falcon might be just a little
too slow and not much too slow.
I'm a little dissappointed about this because the major disadvantage
of the ñDoomğ-port so far was the speed - not the lack of sound or
8-bit resolutions.
I can understand that the 8-bit resolution now enables óTT-usersğ to
play ñDoomğ as well but since the 8-bit mode on óAtari computersğ are
plane-modes while they are chunky-modes on the PC, the speedup of the
8-bit mode is minimal to nonexistant, it's probably even a little
slower.
I also understand the concept of the ñHDIğ and i welcome it, yes, i
really rate it this a very promising and important project, but
giving an unplayably slow version of ñDoomğ the ability to play
sound under òMiNTğ doesn't help much, unfortunately.

So, for all ñDoomğ-players, there's still no cure in sight. The
fastest version of ñDoomğ was ñv0.06ğ, so don't delete it - with
a óct2ğ this was really playable.
For the óTT-usersğ that hope for a ñDoomğ-port, this is not very
helpful as it basically runs, but is simply too slow to play.

Personally, i had hoped Patrice would try to include his own, very
fast óDSPğ-based 3D engine into the original ñDoomğ-port so it
gained some speed. It looks rather like Patrice is currently
concentrating on other details - without a doubt i am thankful that
Patrice is doing a lot, but his current developments go in another
direction than i hoped for.

Patrice also released ñHereticğ and ñHexenğ for the óFalcon/Linuxğ,
but these ports are identical to this ñDoomğ-port and therefore also
suffer from the lack of speed.

ñDoom v0.11ğ may be a step forward, but when it comes to speed, it's
a major drawback.
