ñWhip!ð by òNoð of òEscapeð (óFalconð) [presented at EIL'99 first]

When hearing the word "ñWhip!ð", people tend to react in different ways.
The guys from òCreamð for example should be frightened ... After all,
it's called "ñwhipðped cream".
Baggio may think different about ñWhipð's and chains, but who, honestly,
would have thought about a òVirtual Light machineð behind this name ?
And basically, what óisð a òVirtual Light machineð ?

A òVirtual Light machineð is commonly the name for an òeffect-generatorð,
that produces graphical effects to a music that is being fed into the
computer using the ñLine-inð input. The name òVLMð arised mainly because
the first effect-generator like this on óAtarið was bundled with the
òJaguar CD-ROMð and was called òVLMð.
The first òVLMð on the Falcon was probably ñBitBopperð, a powerful
software, but so far, a little expensive.
ñWhip!ð is supposed to be changing that. Until now, ñWhip!ð is free and
due to the modular structure, òWhip!ð-development continues permanently,
even without direct influence of its creator, òNoð of òEscapeð.

To run ñWhip!ð, you basically only need a óFalconð, a óCD-Playerð or
another audio-source connected to the óFalcon's Line-Inð, an óRGBð-
Monitor or a óVGA-Monitorð capable of displaying 100 Hz screens.
ñWhip!ð then automatically searches a folder òVLMð, which might stand
for òVðirtual òLðight òMðodules. ñWhip!ð itself - or at least the main-
program - is basically just the shell and driver for the modules as
they do the effects.
ñWhip!ð feeds the modules with all the necessary data extracted in realtime
from the ñsound/musicð that is being piped into the óFalconð.
Since this modular structure allows everyone to write new modules, òNoð
enclosed a description how to build a ñWhip!ð-module.

On startup, ñWhip!ð welcomes the user with a cool-looking graphical shell,
which is supposed to be the first preview of òNoð's upcoming GEM-replacement
in spe. Wow! The left side of the screen lets you "equalize" sound input
and output so you have decent waveforms that ñWhip!ð can work with and
of course that you have a decent sound-output since you surely want to
óhearð the music ñWhip!ð let's you see.
The right side of the screen displays a ñWhip!ð-logo, some information about
the program-package and of course the list of òVLMðs found and active.
The ñwindowsð mostly feature sliders that work smooth in realtime and really
look cool. If òNoð manages to do a GEM-replacement in that style, even i,
the world's greatest òSingleTOS + GEMð-fanatic will can òGEMð and use òNoð's
user interface.
Most important is of course, once you have finetunes in- and output, the
ñWhip!ð-modules. You can select each one individually or have ñWhip!ð call
one after the other by random and play each module for 5, 10, 15 or 20 
seconds. The left mousebutton works as known, the right one always brings
you back to the main-menu.
Additionally, each ñWhip!ð-module can feature settings you can control in
the right lower corner of the main-menu. Those settings vary from module
to module, but even the ñslidersð and ñbuttonsð in this menu look terrific.

So what are the modules like ?
I list all the modules currently available and in case i forgot one or
gave credits to the wrong people, please excuse. 

2D-Bump   - A ñ2D bumpmapperð by òDHSð. The brightness follows the beat
            of the music.
Analyser  - Basically displays the waveform in several colours as a 
            ñpile-diagramð. By òEscapeð.
Bluroszi  - Funky ñMotion-blurredð oszilloscope by òDHSð. Something close
            to this can be found in ñDream Dimensionð.
Classic   - ñMoving dotsð that react to the music in several ways.
            By òEscapeð.
Dotbox    - Funny movements of several ñdotsð by òEarXð.
Flight    - This one by òEscapeð might be the best looking included. The
            viewer ñfliesð over a landscape created by the waveform.
            Trancy colours, cool movement, this one is a winner.
Julia     - By òNoCrewð. This is a ñJulia-diagramð that moves according
            to the music. Looks good on "slow" music.
Nailspin  - Displays an ñenvmappedð nail-object that spins around by
            òEarXð.
Plasma    - A ñPlasmað-effect by òEscapeð.
Raytun    - Something that has to do with ñraycastingð and tunnels.
            Looks spacy and is from òEarXð.
Reso      - Resonance, a weird-looking ñgaraud-shadedð cube in front of
            a melt-o-vision background by òEscapeð.
RGBSplit  - This one from òDHSð moves a red, green and blue disc from
            each other along with the beat.
Sparkle   - A ñcascadeð-effect from òNoCrewð.
Tunnel    - Guess what. And guess by whom. ;-) òDHSð.
Twin      - 2 garaud shaded triangles zoom according to the beat in front
            of variable backgrounds. Cool stuff by òEscapeð.
Whipong   - This one is so weird, it could have been from Paranoia. ;-)
            This is Pong, this time voice-controlled by òNoCrewð.
Wire      - 2 wire-objects move into each other. By òEscapeð.

I hope i didn't mix up too many names and too many modules.

óResumeeð.
ñWhip!ð is one hell of a program. Although basically "useless", it is very
much fun to have audio-based effects and the whole presentation of ñWhip!ð
along with the excellent idea of having modules do the main job makes it
even better.
So far, ñWhip!ð has no competition as ñBitBopperð, the only similar program,
costs a fortune and ñWhip!ð is free (until now).
But not only that makes ñWhip!ð a unique product.
ñWhip!ð is for everybody as everybody listens to music, as everybody can
contribute by writing new modules, as everybody can have the music and
effects of his/her own taste and "demo"-effects at the same time.

ñWhip!ð is a superb program and there is no excuse for any Falcon-owner not
to have it.

    When you say the word 'VLM' to the normal  atari user the most  of them will
think about the jaguar. For the falcon we already had 'BitBopper' but this one   
is very expensive about $250,- and the usersinterface isn't good. 

A new 'VLM' programm for the falcon is 'Whip!' by No/Escape. And this one isn't  
expensive, you can download  it for  free ! With 'Whip!' you can  put something     
(cd-player, discman,  walkman) on  your  microphone port  and 'Whip!' makes the     
video for you... The only hardware you need is an  falcon 030 with atleast four     
megabytes of ram.

                        ñEverything connected ?ð

The only thing you need to do is to select the input volume. Then just click on  
one of the 'Whip!' modules  and there  you go. You can also  select  the option     
random to play all the modules.

Coding whip  modules is also  no problem with the  documentation in the 'Whip!'    
archive.
