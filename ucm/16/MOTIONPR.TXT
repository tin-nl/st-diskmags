                                                          Falcon Agression 1999
ò===============================================================================ð

I've reviewed this in the order the proggy files were in the directory...

óANIM.PRGð - At the top of the screen is what looks like a piece of blue to 
orange frosted glass with the Aggression hornet on it, A cube with the Motion
letter than passes under it cutting out the letters into the glass.

òBEZIER.PRGð - A Hornet is animated as a texturemapped dot object pressing F9 
turns it into a torus and F10 back again.

ñEXPLOT.PRGð - Various glowing balls float around the screen the colours blending
in as they cross.

óGTMAP.PRGð - A triangle rotates around one side while leaving a trail of it's 
texture where it had been.

òPAL-DSP.PRGð - A Distorting Roto-Zoom of an eye.

ñROMEO.PRGð - A Julian set factral morpher. Looks a bit wierd but then again it's
fractals :)

óROTTA.PRGð - A Roto-Zoom with motion blurring of an eye.

òSUSIE.PRGð - A flyby of a 3D world with a moving background faking as the sky 
and ground with various bits sticking out the ground at the same height and the
same texture.

ñTORUS.PRGð - A giant "A" fulls the screen made up of only lines along the side
edges of it, this spins on the spot while rolling on the spot.

óWRITER3.PRGð - "Agression" is written on the screen and dissolves, and then a
Hornet is draw and "Agression" written under it this then dissolves too.

òWRITER4.PRGð - A man is draw with hornet wings and stripes and then "keep in.."
is written, this then dissolves and "motion " is then written underlined and 
dissolves.

This looks like it could have made a wonderful demo... anyone gonna finish it 
off.
