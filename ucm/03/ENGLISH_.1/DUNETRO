This dentro  runs really only on STE, but with little  changes also  on STF and
Falcon 030. On STF without  the module-player and on Falcon 030 You must rename
the filenames. (If You want to see the  second part: file PART2.BIN > PART1.BIN
and PART1.BIN > PART2.BIN. New start.)
In this dentro You can see  again some tridis. There  wasn't new  effects but a
lot of grafix between them.
There are  transparent-vectors, multiline-transforming-vex, multishapes, a fast
cube with an Dune-logo in it, some grafix and at last a spaceship from Elite1+2
rotatin' with and in a starfield.
The second part begins with a  nice piccy and show's  You the credits, greetinx
and adresses.
The music is a trackersound.
