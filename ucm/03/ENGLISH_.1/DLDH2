Another F030-Game!

The first fullversion of DLDH. In this Version you have trackerzax, sound, bet-
ter GFX  and faster routines.  Well... the GFX is  not complete and  the  sound
is not the best. But this is, coz the coder is since february '94 in the United
States for about 5 month.

And not to encourage his registered users he has released this  version, before
going to the States.  By his return the game will become  more and more better.

Okay dokay... you can select between two resolution modes and you're also  able
to switch the paranoid-effect on/off (your own men are shooting you... or not).
In the game  you can communicate  with your team, e.g. to say to somebody who's
in your way "Go away".

With the F-Keys you can switch into lower resolutions.  Now the game has also a
highscore list,  which will be saved when you're quitting to  the desktop.


Notes (1=very good...  6=fuck it):

Code   : 3 (slow routines... but only for the moment)
GFX    : 2-3
Muzax  : 2-3
Sound  : 4
-------------
Overall: 3 (because it's a forced release)
