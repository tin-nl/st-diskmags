            Some little question about life and everything...
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" contains some interesting questions,e.g.
in the very beginning of chapter 25:

1. Why are people born?
2. Why do they die?
3. Why do they  want to spend  so much of the intervening  time wearing digital
   watches?

Even the first  question is difficult. One could say it's the bad wish of some-
one. But then the second question is nonsense because nobody beeing evil enough
to let us be born will give us an escape in dead. Unless there is some order in
all the  evil wich makes you go to free the room for new victims. Or everything
is an accident at all? None of the above "someone" but an accident  between two
humanoid beeings. And we can believe that this event causes their dead (for be-
eing ashamed, angry or for the result wanting an enormous heritage ). So we can
explain the first two questions inductive with the accident theory (we are born
accidentally making other people die). The third question still isn't answered.

Personally I prefer the following answers:

1. People are born to wear digital watches.
2. They die for wearing digital watches.
3. They want to  spent so much of  the intervening time wearing digital watches
   because we have nothing other to do.

However, in  the beginning  of "The Restaurant  at the  End of the Universe" is
said:
There is  a theory  wich states  that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the
universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced
by something more bizzare and inexplicable.
There is another wich states that this has already happened.

May be I am  responsible therefor by reason of thinking about the bizzare ques-
tion:
4. Why does all digital watches go wrong all the time?

The solution of  these four uneasy questions will push us on the third level of
civilization's  development  divided  by the "Guide" into HOW-, WHY- and WHERE-
phase explained with the main problem of eating:

1. How can we eat?
2. Why do we eat?
3. Where shall we have lunch?

Now, I think these questions could be ask the same using digital watches:

1. How does an digital watch work?
2. Why do we wear digital watches?
3. Where shall we by our digital watches?

Well, dear "Guide"-fans ( the others haven't read up to here at all... ), don't
take it to serious. Always remember:

                           DON'T PANIC!
