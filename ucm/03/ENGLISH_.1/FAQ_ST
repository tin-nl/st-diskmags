             Frequently asked questions about the Atari ST/STE/Falcon
            -========================================================-

This  text  tries to  answer some  questions often  found in computer magazines
(especially in the C. F.) Feel free to add more and to spread this text.

(IMHO = in my humble opinion)
;-)   = ironic

Q: How can I exchange data between the Atari and the IBM-PC or the Amiga?

 This is best accomplished via disks. All three computers can format IBM-compa-
 tible disks. on the ST, FCOPY (and TOS >1.4 and several other format programs)
 creates disks that can be read without problems by an IBM-PC.
 You should format simple 720 Kbyte DD 3.5 inch (in Germany: 8.89 cm) disks, no
 Hyperformats  or else ( although PCs  with F_READ  accept  these disks, so I'm
 told).
 If this won't work, check the boot sector. Any boot program confuses the  poor
 old PC ;-).
 On the Amiga there are programs (DOS2DOS ?) that can read and write IBM disks.
 So I'm told, I don't have one.
 
(Redax: I know, that DOS2DOS can  read and write IBM-disx. A other program with
        the self meaning is CROSSDOS.)

Q: Is Hyperformatting save?

 Well,the normal ST format  means 80 tracks with  9 sectors. If you format with
 10 sectors, you can store more data. These "10 sector disks" are  rather save,
 even commercial  software houses use them, although they won't load as fast as
 9 sector disks.
 With tricks you can add one  more sector. These disks are (IMHO) not save. You
 can also increase the number of tracks. Not every floppy disk likes this, some
 may work with 83 tracks, some not.
 A simple disk costs  today 1-2 DM. Better  take another  than risks  that your
 (valuable?) data goes into the bit bucket.

Q: What to do against virusses?

 Most ST virusses  are bootsector  virusses. They can  only work if you boot up
 your ST with them. So, never boot with  an unknown disk! Always  boot with the
 same write-protected disk.
 Check any unknown disk with a virus scanner (SAGROTAN,VIRENDETECTOR etc.).
 If possible, write-protect your disks.
 
(Redax: I can only warn for using only the old Sagrotan-protector! This program
        is absolutly not up to date! Sagrotan 4.17 (last PD-version) knows only
        15 bootsector-virusses! Today  there are more than 60 bootsector-virus-
        ses on the good  old ST AND falcon! Use online-detectors  like VACCINE!
        or something like that! Only this programs can totally save your disx!)

Q: What is STOS?

 STOS is a special program language for games. A BASIC interpreter and compiler
 from Britain. Lots  of extensions are available via  english ST magazines (ST-
 FORMAT etc.)

(Redax: You can also make demos with STOS!)

Q: How do I find out my ST's TOS-Version?

 1. Programs to do this: RAPUNZEL,SYS-INFO, STKONFIG etc.
 2. It is coded into the DESKTOP INFO ( e.g. Copyright Atari 1985,86,87,88,89 )
    means TOS 1.04 (TOS 1.4, Rainbow-TOS)
