                     Again a reader's respone to the article:
                      "Warum das so ist" ( "Why that's so" )
                     ========================================

Short time ago I argued that  being engaged to woman would be a  nice way to go
crazy. It's still  right - except the "nice"... Now, here are 20 points why en-
gagement to computers isn't wrong at all:

1.  "Polycompi" is,in difference to polygamy, not forbidden. My STE and my F030
    are good friends.

2.  My computer doesn't eat my oranges.

3.  My computer doesn't eat my bananas, too.

4.  My computer doesn't demand me to cut my hair.

5.  My computer doesn't demand  me to shave  with razor blades instead of elec-
    tric shavers.

6.  My computer doesn't want me to say praising comments.

7.  My computer doesn't pour Sprite onto my head.

8.  My computer doesn't demand me to explain mathematics to him.

9.  My computer doesn't pull me to ( nearly ) everywhere.

10. My computer doesn't whine and blame to me about his boy friend.

11. My computer doesn't want me to copy CD's for him.

12. My computer doesn't knit pullovers.

13. My computer doesn't play "Drachen" or "Columns" until excess on my STE.

14. My computer doesn't serve me potatoe puree with burnded onions.

15. My computer doesn't always lend my vacuum cleaner.

16. My computer doesn't criticize my car or my driving style.

17. My computer leaves me some time for the Internet or Nightfall.

18. My computer doesn't play the unintelligent one.

19. My computer doesn't joke about me.

20. My computer is very kind and nice to me at all.

I guess these arguments will  convince even the last  one hating computers that
computers are the better woman. An other sign  for that is the changed order of
the girls from my "Outing" in Mag 2 (caused by the above points). Instead of:
   Annett S.
   Susann K.
   Nadine K.
   Judy Ch.
now:
   free
   Nadine K.
   Susann K.
   Annett S.
   ( Judy Ch. isn't listed here because  my contact ended after my first letter
     - very awkward and not improving my self confidence )
