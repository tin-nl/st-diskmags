                                  ==========
 
This Shareware program is a good help for those of us who need to protect their
personal data  against nosy friends  or relatives. It crypts  complete disks or
hard disk  partitions. These disks can  be used as usual with the SECURITY.ACC.
Without ACC (and your codeword) the FAT cannot be read.
Protection is rather sophisticated,so if you hide your codeword well,you can be
quite sure.
Of course programs which do not work along ACCs (e.g. games) cannot be crypted.
So,no help here for software pirates.
I didn't test the program with my hard disk, because I'm a terrible coward, but
the whole thing looks rather good.
A good program for the security conscious (or downright paranoid). But even pa-
ranoids may have enemies...
