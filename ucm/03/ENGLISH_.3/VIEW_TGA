                                ===========

The program displays  unpacked TARGA-files. You need a Falcon 030 with best 4MB
or more. The piccy  is displayed in True Color. Using interlace I can show a 18
bit color palette. To display 640  pixels horizontal I  have to average any two
pixels on a VGA-monitor. The quality doesn't suffer from this.

Screenblaster:
==============
Sorry, I couldn't find a  useful "Screenblaster"-mode for ViewTGA. Last but not
least you can't use ViewTGA from a  Screenblasters display mode. Best way is to
use a ST-Mode.

Sorry for the  short description, but it is extra  work for me to translate the
texts into english...
