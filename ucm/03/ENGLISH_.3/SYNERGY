crew          : Synergy
guestparts by : Odyssey
kind          : Megademo
disx          : 2

Wow! Here comes a absolutly great megademo! I think this demo set new standarts
on some areas of ST-demos!

In my opinion the ST-demo-scene was nearly dead  with the appearence of the new
Falcon030, but this demo shows,that the ST isn't at the end.

After the intro,it contains many many cool logos (for every Synergy-member one)
and a very good  Grotesque-like tracker-sound, comes the  mainmenu. This brings
a nice and new sid-music  from Scavenger and  a texture-mapping-cube! This cube
can rotated with the cursorkeyz.

The screens:

"Pajaro" - here You can hear  another sid-music (from Scavenger ofcourse). This
screen is a disc-mag-look-a-like info-part  with nearly complete outings of all
Synergy-members.

"Chip Mon 2" - yo! This  isn't  a really  demo-screen  but a demo-version  of a
sound-chip-editor. By the fact that I'm not a musician, I'll not further intro-
duce this thing now.

"Crapman" - this is a very extendend clone of the good old Pacman-game. I think
all of You know this  game and I'll only say, that this clone  is the best ever
made. It contains  very good and  detailed grafics  and many new  and nice sid-
musix from Scavenger and a lot of new features (2-player-simultan-modus...).

"3D" - Insanity! This is one of the longest  tridi-parts I've ever seen! Unfor-
tunately you can't from this screen return to the mainmenu,but in a screen with
some dots-objects and info's.
But back to the vex. You can see nearly all kinds of vex: line-vex, glence-vex,
and many full-vex in all kinds, shapes and colours. This screen  is also compa-
nied with a good sid-music from... This screen is one of the best tridi-screens
I know,it's almost an 3d-orgie!

The creditz-screen shows You a lot of informations about the demo. You can hear
sid-music (what else?) and see shadebobs,dots,splines etc.

The screen "Symbiosis" is the  guestpart by Odyssey. At the  beginning there is
a starfield and You see some nice logos. Music again by Scavenger. In the main-
part of this screen gives masses of vex-ball-objects. This screen isn't so good
because it's a little bit monotonous.

All in one it's  one of  the best  ST-demos ever! Unfortunately  it is the last
ST-demo from Synergy,only Chip Mon 2 will be further developed.
I can only say: get it!
