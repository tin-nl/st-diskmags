                        Terry Pratchett
                        ===============

Well, this article  is entitled so generally because I want to speak about more
than one  book of  the above  write tough  I did  read only one: "Wyrd Sisters"
( germ. "MacBest" ). I already  knew Terry Pratched because I found some of his
books in the book stores. However, I never bought them.
Little time ago I spotted a book in our library with a paperback not fitting to
the title: "MacBeth". Getting  closer it  turned to "MacBest" and was a part of
the Discworld-cycle of Terry Pratchett. I lent it and in the days after I near-
ly died of laughing.
Master Pratchett pulls nearly everything into pieces which happened in the last
1000 years - from  decency  over  da Vinci, Middleage, witches, castles, kings,
love and sex, actors, Shakespeare, people, geographics, society, several alarms
( ok, insiderjoke... ) to woods and  modern flying  equipment. I want to repeat
the first chapter ( very shorted ):

A hut. Night. Lightning. Thunder. Flashs. A boiling pot. Three shapes. A horri-
fying  voice: "When shall  we  meet again?" ( should  be  the  first  words  of
"MacBeth" ). A quite normal voice: "Well, next tuesday I have time!"

In this  style it goes on 350 pages. And that's only one of the 10 books of the
Discworld-cycle. And  there is  also  the  Nomen-cycle ( 3 books ) and possibly
some more books... The only mistake in my German edition are some swapped names
( at least I guess so ), but at all it is a wonderful joke.
