At the 1.1.94 released The Detonators  her new ST-demo. To the beginning I will
remark, that this demo, except the intro and end-screen, is coded only in GFA.
Let's start the review.
In the intro U can see a little "intel outside"-piccy, a cool DNS-logo (inspie-
red by The Syndicate - If Pigs Could Fly ) and a  vertical rotator (RAGE-logo).
The music is composed by Mad Max and uses digidrums (from the game 'A Prehisto-
ric Tale').
The next part is a rasterscroller in overscan,it tells the message:"This dentro
could cause braindamages!!!".
Now beginn's the main-part. At first You can see a nice DNS-logo and some infos
about the demo. The music is a digidrum-tune from Scavenger of Synergy. Now You
can see a lot  of old and new effects. The show  contains shade-bobs, 3D-chess-
boards,fractales, keftales, pseudo-plasmas, a fractale landscape (it looks very
good) and a 3D-twistscroller.
The next part is a  little picture-show with  photos from a little DNS-meeting.
You'll see the members of DNS with wholly  stupid grimaces and you hear a sound
with extremely ugly samples (it sounds like a crazy ape). I don't know why this
slideshow included in this demo.
The dentro  continue with  the endpart. You can read some infos about the demo-
screens ( like credits ) and some messages. This part  contains a nice tracker-
sound.
The little resetdemo contains a starfield with a DNS-logo and chip-musix.

What should  I say? It's  not bad and  not brilliant, it's just average. But in
fact,that not many new st-demos came out, You should take  a look at this piece
of coding!

(Drizzt at the keys: Hey Detonators! You might be disappointed, but you weren't
the first to code Shadebobs  in GFA. The Intro of UCM 1,  which was released in
october '93 contained 5 shadebobs (4 planes/10*10 pixel) coded by me in GFA...)
