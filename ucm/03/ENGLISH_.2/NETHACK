                        In love with a little green mold
                         How NETHACK changes your life
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reading this section of our mag you are probably a gamer, or, at least, like to
refresh your mental abilities with a little game sometimes.
If you're also  a RPG-fan, you surely  noticed the lack  of good  games of this
kind on the Falcon 030.
You'd wait and watch holes in the ceiling night after night, like I did.
Now your - and my - prayers have  been answered and NETHACK appeared in the in-
ventory of your local PD-dealer or in  the disc-box of your best computer-mate.
Is it worth  to effort to  format a disc  and copy it you may ask. I did it and
began to play.

And found it is great.

If you expect stunning graphics as seen in Ultima VII on the PC or in Ambermoon
you will  find the  game a  little bit  disappointing, and if  you expect great
music and  fascinating SFX you'll find ... er, none of them, but if you're hea-
ding for a good and exiting game, you're right.

In fact, there is nothing  really outstanding  about Nethack, you can start the
game with certain  abilities and special inventory, depending on what character
you choose ( e.g. Wizard, Barbarian, Tourist ...), and  you start in - surprise
surprise - level one.
For the levels there are 'round 20, but  nobody knows the exact number, because
nobody ( I know ) managed it to complete them all ( I'm in level 8 ).

The main aim  is to find an amulet  and to take it to the exit. A second aim is
to survive.
And believe me, the second  one is difficult. Hundred  of monsters of different
types and fighting abilities await you, millions of really crude traps can give
you the last kick - sometimes  I think, all of Nethack is one big trap - hunger
and sicknes guide your way.

Fortunately you can wear armor, use spells and weapons, search for hidden doors
and traps, drink healty  potions and do  a lot of other  things helping  you to
survive and to fulfil your task.
And of all  the things mentioned  above are many  kinds and pieces existing, so
the dungeons are  a paradise for role players that look for the best weapon and
try to get the highest armor-class.

But by far the  best feature of  Nethack is, that each time you start the game,
new levels  get created. Even  if you  should solve  the game, you can  play it
again and again, without getting bored.

By far the worst feature is the save option. You can save only one single game,
and if you get killed even this single little game gets erased.

As said, nothing  really outstanding. But nevertheless  nethacking means fun. I
just like  this type of game. It is  absorbing and entertaining  to walk trough
the dungeons, kill masses of bad, bad monsters, kill also masses of  not so bad
monsters (yes, such guys  are also there!), cast spells, figure out the meaning
of spells and try the potions (most of them are no good for adventurers...)

But reading the title of this article I remember, that I wanted to tell you,how
the game changes your life, so how does it?

I doesn't at all, but it's a good game if you like the genre, if you don't,read
another test.
I personally was exited  about the atmosphere  and the good - but really hard -
gameplay. Believe me, you'll have fun, and considering  that nethack  is one of
not too much Falcon games you should try.

PS: You can play Nethack also an every other TOS-Computer,for it's a GEM Proggy
and will run  also on ST/STE/TT. All you need  is at least 640*480 Pixel and 16
stunning colours. The game will run in every other Graphics-mode too,but either
you'll see not  too much or you'll have to use ASCII-graphics - and you must be
a hardcore-RPG-fan to play a game in such manner.

On my very own Falcon the game has a little bug, it doesn't react anyway in the
standard high resolution, but it runs happily in 800*600 16 or 256 colours.
Don't ask me why ...
