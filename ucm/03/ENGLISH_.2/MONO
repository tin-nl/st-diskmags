                                 ~~~~~~~~~~

Hi Mono-Freax....

these  screens  were  coded  for  the Swiss-Alp-Convention  megademo. This demo
should be the first one only  for  the  monochrome monitor. But sadly this demo
was never finished.....

They are now over one year old  and the demo should never be released. So I de-
cided to release my  parts for the  demo with  this magazine (for  your info: I
changed my pseudo...).

I hope you enjoy our work for the mono-monitor,because I don't think that we'll
do this again.

OK, have fun with our  production and...... buy a color-monitor to get the real
pleasure!!!!!!!!!!!

(Redax: Just take a look at the disc 1  of this magazine. You'll find the demo-
        screens (They are very nice!) in the folder "demoz". By the way, in the
        screen "no border" can  You see the  LOW BORDER IN MONOCHROME!!! It's a
        world-premier! It's no joke  or something like that, it's real like You
        and me!)
