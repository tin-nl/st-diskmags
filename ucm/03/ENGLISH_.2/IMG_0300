There are  a lot  of paint programs  around which  use GDOS and  generate those
fine, resolution-independent  GEM-files. Only most  text processors  won't load
them! And it's not easy to convert GEM-files to more common pixel formats.
But now there is a simple solution. Just get the IMG-0300-GDOS driver.
It generates a monochrome 300 dpi IMG-file on disk. To do this you have to copy
the driver into your GEMSYS-folder and to install it in your ASSIGN.SYS.
By the way,the fine ASSIGN.PRG (Author: Dirk Sawialsky) is a great help dealing
with your ASSIGN.SYS.
I've put it in position 21 so that I get an IMG-file everytime to program sends
the data to the printer.
Works like a charm.
Thanks to Julian Reschke for this great program.
