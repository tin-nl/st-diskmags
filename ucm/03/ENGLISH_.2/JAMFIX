                                ==========

You know, the famous  JAM-Pack does not work  in ST-comptible screenmodi of the
F030. Now, I did write a  little program to fix the bug in a JAM-packed proggy.
You simply have  to pull your packed  program to JAMFIX.TTP and it will correct
the offset Physbase+$7f00 wich causes the colorful stripes in non-ST-modi and a
bus error in ST-modi to a better one of Physbase-$100.

Sorry for the  short description, but it is extra  work for me to translate the
texts into english...
