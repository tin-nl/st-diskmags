It doesn't  took very long  and after the very dull first "resurrection" release
of ñMJJ PRODð on the ST another  release  popped up, right after the ñMJJ PRODð team
was  growing  up while  allowing  several other  french Atarians  to join  their
forces...

And while  ñFEL'Xð, the  so-called big boss  of  the band is  throwing around  big
words and  sentences, the band itself is going to catapult itself much more back
into  meaninglessness as  it did with  their ó"MJJ SLIDESHOW"ð (read  more in this
UCM...). But later more for this...

ó"MJJ PLAYER"ð is  nothing  special, it's a music  demo, or better a module colly,
using an  own coded  menu to replay  all of them. It is done for  the  Atari STe
mainly but runs on Falcon too, but here  with the drawback that it will run only
from  the root  of the  harddisk, the demo isn't  satisfied with the fact  to be
copied to a special folder.

It starts with a  small intro that is playing a chip music, showing a  òvery nice
òlogoð by their grafist ñC-REMð (who is called to be a former member of  ñMAD VISION,
hu? Since  ñMAD VISIONð died  about 9 years back to  form ñEKOð I need  a bit to re-
assemble my mind...). This logo is as said  òwell doneð  and even if the  style is
not new it is some original pixel work... Take a look at it here...

{*i MJJPLAY1.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

òIgnore the crap in the lower part of the screen... The 2oo2 is a vu meter :)

Yes, the intro doesn't features more stunning  stuff, just a scroller  that runs
like a drunken cow  and nobody is  able to read, at least on the Falcon. Beneath
the logo there is a "mirrored" distorter of the logo itself, at least it wobbles
and seems to be thought as dister...

Ok, after pressing space, the intro fades  out badly and we enter the music menu
that is  completely  controlled by keyboard. Above there is a  small MJJ logo by
ñWILFRIEDð and below the music titles are listed. You can  chose the single tracks
with the keys from 1 to 8 and change the pages with  F1 and F2. While the  track
is played you  can blend in some info page at the place of the logo by  pressing
space... Now  you can see  some info and  a quite ugly dancing animation  in two
layers... Arg... This  guy (the the  girl...) seems  to be drunken  or suffering
under spongomalie, weird, weird. This  little gimmick  surely doesn't òburns  any
òpants offð but is at least a little idea to òbrighten up the dull sceneryð...

The musix itself seems to be a òbrainless collection of old modulesð, some of them
surely have 1o years on their  back, names like ñ4-MATð and ñDR.AWESOMEð (Crusaders)
surely are  known to anyone. The tracks  are mainly using chipmod samples  since
they're all quite  small and so  it wasn't that challenging to bring  16 modules
onto one  disk. Overall they're sounding  òvery old fashionedð mostly and I wonder
if there are some people who listened all of them... This kind of music disx, in
times of homebrewn stuff or collections that  featuring exclusive  tracks, is so
damn outdated  that I wonder  if the guys behind are really  living in  the year
2oo2...

Not much words to loose  here anymore, by  pressing ESC you see  a last picture,
showing a  quite ok  logo in  green/yellow colours  on white  background and the
"actual" memberlist (that already changed in the readme file on disk again).
Then the demo ends and turns back to desk.

I really wanted to take another screenshot from the spongo dancers in the menu
but unfortunately the XGRABBER was bombed out after the intro... :)

òfinal words... What to say? MJJ PROD are back, sure, they're turning out to be
ò               one of the most active bands in 2oo2, still growing and growing
ò               and promising more and more releases... But, at first, while some
ò               parts of this music colly are nice done, like the grafix, alone
ò               the idea to mix various modules of foreign composers is so damn
ò               outdated that I wonder that some people are still doing such
ò               demos... At second, the putting together isn't the burner as well
ò               even if this release is a bit better as that damn slideshow...
ò               So if you like old fashioned music collies you should risk a look
ò               onto the "MJJ PLAYER"... but don't wait for too much, if you do
ò               not want to see a band ruining its selfmade hype then don't get
ò               your hands on this thing... It would force you to cry...

This demo is no world beater and even if it's announced to be done by one of the
"most famous  french Atari demo groups" (as on  the PACIDEMO page) this  doesn't
helps to make it better. MJJ PROD, or that what is left of it or new created now
is walking on damn thin  ice atm since over  the past 8 years the label MJJ PROD
was bound onto names like STEPH, JOKER and NIKO, who created some very nice demo
stuff on  the Falcon that  was really  rocking. Their demo "Mostly Harmless" was
some kind of a monument of the early Falcon demo scene  and helped to build  the
hype  around the  label MJJ PROD... This  hype is going  to be destroyed by such
releases as the "MJJ SLIDESHOW" and "MJJ PLAYER" together with such amusing
announcements and full mouth spoken words...

òDon't get me  wrong here, I'm happy to see MJJ PROD back on  the Atari scene but
òI would like to see more mature releases, over all of better quality and without
òsmashing on the shit  since those two releases aren't signs of the "most famous"
òfrench demo group...
