ñCOOL GIRLSð was  announced as new "coding team" from  Slovakia, consisting of two
girls and you can see  their photo's on  the internet... But, after  all, do you
really believe in  this? Today, as the Atari scene is going smaller and smaller,
esp. from a  country that isn't  known for its big  Atari scene, now should come
a band working on Falcon and consisting of girls... naaah...

I for myself doubt this and there are a few reasons to do so.

Ok, this little production  doesn't offers much to talk  about. The intro starts
with a òvery ugly title screenð, showing  a "Cool Girls" logo in changing colours,
some small line  vectors and  a vector area built  of dots. This all comes along
with some polka oriented module sound  and what to say, it's obviously a new try
to resurrect the starving fake demo scene on the Atari.

The next, and also final screen, offers a òvery slow fire effectð, that isn't only
slow but also of  òvery low  qualityð for a  Falcon fire. It seems as some  pseudo
houses are burning down. On the upper  part of the screen  a slow text displayer
shows up  some stuff like "Sweety Buildings"... blabla. The  text is written in,
tata, Atari system font and burning away too.

There are even some greetings included  there, to Paranoid (who wrote some lines
about some special  slovakian productions in the last issue of Alive) and me, as
I wrote down my thoughts about the ñSATANTRONICð releases in the last UCM...

So try to imagine now who could stuck behind the "Cool Girls"... the range isn't
that big and the fire  reminds in his slowness to the first release of the "Blue
Fire" by  ñSATANTRONICð last year. Anyway, I  think I wrote  already too much here
and so we will go on with the last words...

ò...final words... "Sweety Buildings" stucks  itself  into the old  range of fake
ò                  demo's with its  ugly music and  dull "design". What  the demo
ò                  brings onto the the  screen tries to look as an usual demo but
ò                  fails in every range. Just one thing turned up in my mind...
ò                  This dull thing isn't meant earnest.

ñWhat to say... some people are able to do intelligent  fake demos, and there are
ñpeople who  are crying  for bad  reviews... the "Cool G”rls" (whoever  they are)
ñsurely belong to the second group.

                Greetings to "Sandra" and "Timea" - ñYou're the best!
