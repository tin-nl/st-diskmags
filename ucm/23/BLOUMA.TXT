                      BLOUMA'S ADVENTURE - Dream or reality?!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're  still following  the Atari scene you  surely have  heard of this game
project, done  by several  czech  Atari freaks. If not, here  you will  get some
facts about this game at first.

ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð was called to be the last big game project by óEMPTY HEADð, one
of the leading  czech Atari ST coders, who is  responsible  for the shell of the
czech language based diskmag  ñNARSILð as well, and who maintained one of the most
important  czech Atari ST pages. He stucks hard  together with  óMC SOFTð, another
czech  software label, mostly  known because  of the great  overhead racing game
ñPOWER UPð for ST, that was released in the late nineties.

Furthermore he works under the label óHEADACHE PROJECTð, better to say, he is this
label, grin. Anyway, as said, ñBLOUMAð should be the last big game project by this
czech coder  and the works  started somewhen  in the middle nineties, in 1995 if
I'm right. He joined forces with óJIRI SUCHANEKð, running under the nick ó-JS-ð, one
of the most powerful and impressing czech  graficians at all, who creates really
stunning grafix  and animations, mainly  he does all  the pixel  jobs for ñNARSIL
magazine, too, as well  as he did the grafix  work for the game ñPOWER UPð, that I
have mentioned above.

ñBLOUMAð is thought to be some kind of jump'n'run game with adventure touch, maybe
a bit like ñRICK DANGEROUSð with a touch of ñGODSð maybe, strange melange, huuu...
Your  aim in the  game is to  run around, try to  avoid the contact with enemies
and horrifying creatures, collecting  several items, use  switches and  so on to
reach the goal. Furthermore your hero changes into a fish if he falls into water
and so you can go on in the search for the exit...

That sounds not  bad and the few  screenshots released on the  homepage of óEMPTY
óHEADð always made  me hungry for  more, and not only me I think :) Btw,  the shot
above isn't from the homepage but taken from the ñNARSILð magazine  which seems to
be the only source for news about this game.

On the page there were more shots to find, but after  all there was never a demo
of the game released or  a planned release date  set and so I think  many people
have already forgotten this  game project... just think that it is already seven
years in development now!

Before I will write more, check the links below to see more óBLOUMAð artwork...

Ok, have  you followed the links? And, I know  that your  teeth are dripping now
and you'll get sleepless nights... Naaaa.

I will make it  short. ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð  is dead! At  least if  nobody else is
willing to step into the development. óEMPTY HEADð has dropped the game some times
ago and don't want to go on with it as he told me!

After a few conversations I matched it to bring him to the point to make all the
stuff that was done so far (mainly the artwork) available for the public to find
the one or other interested coder who want to take over the project to finish it
somewhen. So he upped all the stuff done so far for the game here...

òwww.gyrec.cz/~atari

There get the file òblouma.bz.2

There  you will  find a lot of  grafix, animation  files, first source codes and
stuff. The biggest parts are packed into a file of about 7 MB and this shows the
contents of grafix and animations. In my eyes no other game in the past years on
the ST contained such an amount of grafix and animations!

As he  told me there  was a level  editor created  as well as  some first sprite
routines created. So the  problem should be  clear... This isn't  a project that
just needs a few  finishing touches but  a hell of a  coder to realize it, maybe
the whole stuff has even to be rewritten from scratch. I don't know since I'm no
coder at all. Even  if óEMPTY HEADð don't  wants to go  on with the  game he is at
least so  kind enough  to offer a  bit help to  the one who  would take over the
project. Just remember, the most comments are written in czech language... So he
could give hints up to a special limit. Contact him via:

òkarelrous@volny.cz

Ok... That's  it for this time. I will  focuse more  onto this  project and will
report the things going on (again). So go ahead and make this dream real!
