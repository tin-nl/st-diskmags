At last, after  about 1,5 years of  silence, the  ñYM ROCKERZð striked back with a
new and  stunning chip  musix collection. It was  announced since many weeks and
after a while I didn't believed to see it in the end, I checked the internet and
the ñYM ROCKERSð page daily  but nothing happened  and so I was damn surprised and
also very happy as I checked this morning that TAO matched it to finish this new
music demo last night.

After some  problems while  downloading it (since  ñTAOð didn't linked it right on
the page), in the end I had it on my Falcon, checking up that it refused to work
on VGA... no problem I thought and so I copied the demo to a disk, trying it out
on my STFM but he fucked up, again and again with things like that: empty folder
and  can't find that  application, TOS error 35  and so on... After several copy
sessions I gave up and connected my Falcon to the TV set and, finally I was able
to run the demo, lucky guy :)

I have to say it  right at first. It is a pure  music demo, based on the sources
of the last one, "just" with new musix and changed grafix.
At first comes a  small intro sequence  with a cool poem (you can find above) in
white letters on dark blue background  and a cool sid/chip music starts to play,
getting more and  more intensive. Than an intro picture followes, followed again
by the  main menu, showing a stilizised  record player on the left and the musix
menu on the right. The grafix are drawn by Exocet and quite nice again, but this
time without the Exo typical comic figures.

The menu reveales  the intro music as a track  by ñMAD MAXð, previously unreleased
and maybe exclusively  done for this  compile? It is a  rather nice track called
"Faith" and would fit very well to a real demo. The tracklist followes...

o1 - DMA SC of Sector One - "Visitors From Dreams"
o2 - Tao of Cream - "Heftig"
o3 - Nemo - "2 Lifes Left"
o4 - Nemo - "Game Over"
o5 - MC Laser of .tSCc. - "Mourning"
o6 - 5o5 of Checkpoint - "Headaxe"
o7 - Bodenst„ndig 2ooo - "Landflucht"
o8 - Mad Max of TEX - "Faith"

óLandflucht....

You surely will have some question  signs in your eyes now, since you don't know
who ñNEMOð and ñBODENSTŽNDIG 2oooð are. It is  really easy  to solve, ñNEMOð is no one
else than ñMILHOUSEð, using a new nickname now.
ñBODENSTŽNDIG 2oooð is  originally a  german "underground" freak band that has its
routs on  the Atari. So their  member ñDRAXð is known to  the one or  other of you
because of  his óTRACKCOMð musix on the Falcon and  I remember an interview by him
in the german  magazine óBODYSTYLER (R.I.P.)ð where he was talking about his routs
but to me it was a bit unknown that they did chip musix, too.

The rest of the team should  be wellknown since  it is nearly the  same staff as
for their other music demo, "Wave Upon Wave" (reviewed for UCM # 21).

The included music styles are very various  this time and  reaching from òtypical
òhappy-demo-soundtrack-a-likeð  (esp. ñMC LASER, NEMO, DMA SCð and ñMAD MAXð) over the
usual ñTAOð òtypical buzzer stuffð up to very òstrange noisesð by ñ5o5ð who  is going to
check out when the YM chip should explode or even the real  outstanding ñBSð tune,
using strange sample stuff and presenting some kind of òchip-drum'n'bass... cool!

What to say more?! Let us bring the final words now...

ñ"SPINNING WHEELS" is an  outstanding piece of new school  Atari chip musix demo,
ñblowing  fresh air into the  old soundchip  of our machines. The  quality of the
ñmusix is again very high and with the mentioned BODENSTŽNDIG 2ooo tune some real
ñinteresting thing popped up, breaking a lot of limits.
ñThe style of the shell is nice but steps back behind the attacks onto your ears.

óSurely the final rating falls back a bit, but the 1oo % on the  audio should say
óall I think :) After all I hope to volume 3 a bit faster now...
