Argh! It  was  damn quiet around  óSTAXð and  their english  member, ñBODð. His last
appearance  on the scene  was his very  mediocre contribution  to the óDHS Summer
óCompetitionð last year. So it was quite surprising that a small release popped up
now, but as the size of the screen already shows, it isn't much waiting for us.

The screen runs òonly on ST and STeð, but I have to admit already here that Falcon
owners  don't miss much, sorry. Since  the title  of the screen  doesn't shows a
deeper sense, at least  for the ones who  aren't stuck night  and day on special
sites on the Internet, I will write a few lines about the thing here.

Ok, after loading the demo, the screen turns black and suddenly two little white
eyes are opening, looking around and blinking a bit nervous.
Then an òoldfashionedð, hundred times heard before, chip music  by ñBig Alecð of the
óDelta Forceð starts to play, while  a porn picture  appears on the  screen and so
you see what cave is  meant, since a cunt is wide spread and those blinking eyes
are watching out of it. I'm just interested here why the screen is called "lost"
since I remember this to be a very comfortable place, yamn, hehehe...

Anyway, the screen shows above an  old small green  óSTAXð logo, painted  by their
ex-member  ñSODANð about 1o  years ago. Below  the picture  there is  a small text
displayer, which gives short info about the screen. So ñBODð says that this screen
hasn't  to be taken  earnest or something, but  after all  it doesn't  helps the
whole thing and it's... òjust crapð... sorry.

While pressing  space you go cleanly back to desktop after the whole stuff faded
out smoothly. So you can decided if you save it or delete it...

ñ...final words...

I always wonder what ideas  some people  have. Maybe this  screen makes you grin
for just a milli second, but then? Nothing, it's just a small screen òwithout ANY
òhighlightsð, not even the idea  will make you  loading it twice. I have to wonder
about the fact that people  are still killing their  time in creating such stuff
and not trying to create something more and better instead òwasting their timeð...

What to say, even uninteresting for  porn lovers, since who is interested in the
year of 2oo2 in 16 colours porn pictures?!
