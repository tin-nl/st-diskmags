                    THE (FORMER) GERMAN ATARI SCENE ON THE NET
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At last  here it comes... My "ultimate" german  scene homepage  review, so often
announced  and never done, untill now. I have to admit that it wasn't easy to do
this one since I had to rewrite this article at least two times from scratch.

Since I needed  so long several pages  disappeared and this was lowering also my
motivation. Now I'm  able to offer  a survey  over the  german  (ex) Atari group
pages, not as big as I wanted  it, and not as detailed  as well, since I decided
to kick out members  pages in the  end as the most  of them don't deal the Atari
contents mostly.

I have checked all pages and at least now in October 2oo2 they're all still here
and running. I checked the design, the offered features (like stories, downloads
and so on), the actuality and the need to surf them on.

Enough crap... let's start!

maintained ................. Jacky of ACF
status of the band ......... Dead! Last official release in 1995
last update of the site .... unknown, quite long time ago

ACF was a legendary  team on the ST  but loosing  its creative core with AGENT T
and TAO the band  lost the ground as well and never came back to life really, so
they matched  it only to bring  one name into demo history "Just Buggin'", their
other releases before or after "Just Buggin'" never got that big reputation...

It is a shame to  see that  site nowadays  or at least  the things that are left
over on  the  net. In  the middle  nineties, as  the  Atari scene  conquered the
internet it  wasn't only one of  the first Atari scene web pages on the net, no,
it was also one  of the most interesting ones, with a huge links area, chatroom,
guestbook, downloads and so on, nice styled and always worth to be surfed on...
It was cool designed  with a lot of AGENT T's grafix and I remember the times as
we stumbled into  the computer rooms of the university of Leipzig to take a look
at it or sitting in internet cafe's and searching through the site...

Nowadays the  site is given  up completely, only a shadow of itself and it seems
that the  only reason to see it still online is the fact that some files weren't
deleted from the servers...

Styling... nothing to tell about... crap
Features.. nothing as well, just some files that survived a server clean up
Atari?.... since there are no contents it isn't about Atari as well
Surf on... no, make a bow around it, just wasted time and money

maintained ................. Fried of Avena
status of the band ......... Inactive/dead on Atari! Last official release 1998
last update of the site .... 1.3.o2

AVENA... another  big name  in the Atari demo  history, mainly  because of their
rocking Falcon demos, esp. the  ones created by  their english  coder TAT in the
late  nineties.. But with TAT  leaving the scene and TOMMY commiting suicide the
band lost his last active members and went inactive since this time...
But names like "Enraged", "Weltschmerz" and over all "Sonolumineszenz" will ever
stay in the minds of Atari Falcon demo lovers... after turning inactive the band
changed to  to collecting pool  of inactive german Atari sceners but that didn't
helped...

The first AVENA site was always worth to be surfed on, featuring  a great forum,
downloads  from demos  and musix, java  adventures and  more... a  trailer  that
announced the rebuilding of the site made me hungry for more...

But today the  AVENA site isn't worth anything anymore... the design is a matter
of taste, but the completely lack of  contents, except a bunch of extremely dull
Flash comics, drags the site into the deepest hole...

Styling... surely a matter of taste... dark and depressing...
Features.. no forum/downloads/informations/links, just dull flashmovies
Atari?.... only mentioned somewhere in the description what Avena is/was
Surf on... for Atarians there is no use to go there, if you like primitive flash
           movies then check it out...

status of the band ......... sleeping atm, last Atari release summer 2k1
last update of the site .... 8.7.o2

CHECKPOINT should be  a wellknown band, gathering a few very talented chaps like
DEFJAM as magnificent coder, MODMATE as pixel magician and  5o5 as god of musix,
but unfortunately DEFJAM is  the only  coder and dives in  PalmOS and GBA waters
nowadays while MODMATE stopped pixels long time ago.. Rumours about their latest
demo called "Mono Style/Posh/whatever" are around since 2 years  now and I doubt
that we  will see some single bit of it. But after all with their stunning "Sure
Trip" demo  they  have set  a technical  monument on the ST that can be called a
mile stone of the resurrected ST scene...

The CHECKPOINT site offers a mediocre design (Who the  hell did the ugly logo?),
a few site news, a very mixed  link page and the complete downloads of the band.
The former guestbook is out of order atm and that's it already...

Styling... quite mediocre, no milestone at all (I miss more mOdmate style ;)
Features.. site oriented news, a few informations, all downloads, links
Atari?.... very Atari related, but now also GBA/PalmOS stuff is flooding in :/
Surf on... if you're missing something from the CP releases, it is a must...

last update of the site .... 16.o4.o1

Is there anything to add to the name CREAM? Build up  from the ruins  of the ACF
DESIGN TEAM, CREAM  was  growing up  to one of  the biggest  names  in  the late
nineties but unfortunately the  group was falling  asleep over their latest demo
called "Heftig" that  was thought  to be released  in 1999... only real lifesign
of the  band is TAO, supporting several projects  with musix and acting as coder
for the YMROCKERS... but there are some signs on the horizon...

The site is  without any  doubt one  of the  most interesting  ones german Atari
sceners  ever set into  the net. It offers  a very clean design without too much
play  around, stories  about  the  history of  CREAM, a huge  download area with
screenshots and  info for every production, a group diary where you can find the
latest developments  in the group dynamic, a guestbook, a few links, musix to be
replayed with  ST sound plugin, ofcourse  composed by  TAO as well  as a subpage
dedicated to their JAM player, a multi format music player for Atari systems and
last but not least, TAO isn't only the coder for YM ROCKERs but also maintaining
the web site of this (atm german musicians dominated) chip music project.

Styling... very clean, easy to navigate through, could stand as example
Features.. history, diary, downloads, links, guestbook, all you need to get
Atari?.... completely atari oriented
Surf on... the update  shows that  there isn't  much going  on... but  always to
           check the diary :)

status of the band ......... active
last update of the site .... somewhen in 2oo1

Are there  any  words to  loose about ESCAPE? Since  their "Hmmm" demo I believe
not, since  ESCAPE didn't only  made their  complete breakthrough  in the Falcon
demo scene with  this release, no, they're playing  in the  first row since this
time and  I have to say  that NO's team has a promising future, at least I think
so since  with the organizing  of the EIL parties  they have  set a monument for
themselves in doing  the mostwanted Atari related demo parties of the last years
and maybe the best Atari parties since long long times at all.

Their page is a bit  strange designed, in parts quite  colourful but the buttons
to navigate  through the site  are quite small. The  site features  informations
about the group, group  news and updates, sub  pages for their  special projects
"Whip" (Atari  Falcon  virtual light  machine) and  "Escape Paint", informations
about future projects, but no links page but therefore a big download area.
Here you  have to use  the ftp instead of  the links of the page since those are
linked to nothing anymore since the server was reorganised.

Styling... a bit strange and a matter of taste
Features.. a lot of infos about projects, group downloads
Atari? ... completely atari oriented
Surf on... from time to time it could be usefull, maybe to discover new plug ins
           for "Whip" and "Escape Paint"?

maintained ................. Mad Butscher of Foundation Two
status of the band ......... active, but mainly 8bit nowadays
last update of the site .... somewhen in 2ooo

FOUNDATION TWO isn't a big name  on the ST/Falcon, better  known is  maybe their
old semi professional software project SOLUTION SOFTWARE... furthermore F2 never
stepped into  demo coding, therefore  more in games development but their latest
releases for the ST and  Falcon  lay back in 1997 but there seem to be movements
to come back to the Falcon sector nowadays since MAD BUTSCHER is working on some
stuff again...

Another thing  that FOUNDATION TWO stays for is to being a melting pot of gamers
on all Atari systems and to co-organise the UNCONVENTIONAL PARTIES together with
ABBUC members, that are, unfortunately, not very attracting to ST/Falcon sceners
so far, but I hope those parties will get more attention next year and so on.

The page itself wasn't  updated since long and seem  to be lost for itself since
the only updates are going on at the Unconventional pages nowadays. So all stuff
on  here is  very outdated. It  features downloads  of their  releases (but only
untill 1999, it doesn't matter what system) as  well as the Uncon subpages, that
are more often updated and redisgned.
The design of  the page is quite mediocre and far from being state of the art or
something...

Styling... only mediocre, matter of taste
Features.. a few downloads, very 8bit oriented, Uncon subpages
Atari?.... yeps, but mainly 8bit!
Surf on... better try the  Uncon subpages only... or if  you're missing  some of
           the SOLUTION SOFTWARE titles.

status of the band ......... inactive/dead on atari - last official release 1996
last update of the site .... 12.o7.96

With INTER another dinosaur has still his page online. INTER was growing up to a
big name  on the Falcon scene  after the  guys of TFC (esp. LoST) joined them in
1994, before this time the band was only a shadow.
INTER raised for  short time over  the following 2 years with a wave of in parts
very impressive  productions and  contributions to  other projects popped up and
then the crew started  to stumble, several members went inactive, left the Atari
scene or joined other bands, such as AVENA (without coming back to activity).
It is still some kind of strange to see  that many members of  the german Falcon
scene of the early  nineties thought to have found something cool with OS2 as so
many of them changed onto this system but were falling into meaninglessness then
on this system as it never was a big thing...

The page by LoST represents  this last state of the band before it vanished from
the screen. The page itself offers a lot of informations even if a few parts are
set up with  a big "under construction" logo  but I'm sure we will never see the
final results there...
The filled parts delivering a lot of infos, like softography (even of LoST's pre
INTER  times), compo  results  and  stuff,  unfortunately  no  downloads,  sneak
previews onto their way on PC/OS2 and a completely outdated linklist...

The design  of the page is  quite clear  but the server  it stays on seems to be
damn slow and  often you need to  try to connect again and again since often the
message that the server is out of order appears on the screen.

Styling... nice and clear, quite dark
Features.. a bigger bunch of informations, a big but outdated linklist, no dl's!
Atari?.... big parts are Atari related
Surf on... only if you need some infos about INTER and if you want to read about
           demos and  games that  were released  by them  but vanished  from the
           screen completely (I wonder  where  their  early Falcon demos/screens
           are, I never  saw one in the  public (only on the DCC'93 on the compo
           screen...)) So if someone got hold of them, please get in touch!

status of the band .......... inactive/dead, last Atari release 1994 (!)
last updated of the site .... unknown

NEW POWER GENERATION, a name that  is lost in  the endless  space, after a bunch
of Demo Compact  disx in the  beginning nineties on  the ST and a  few very cool
ST  demos with in  parts high technical  standard and  through CARNERA's special
pixels with  a quite unique style, they belonged to the first row of Falcon demo
makers, releasing  two big Falcon demos, that  both didn't  matched  it to break
LAZER's "1st place domain"... There  were a  few more  little demos  and screens
around, but the most interesting thing  apart from demos was  their huge project
on the gaming area, "Boom", later  also known as "Incubator", unfortunately this
project died over the years it was in development, I think back in 1996 or so it
was dropped completely. Too bad. 1996 was also the last time we saw their coder,
JARON, doing something on his Falcon but in fact this stuff was never released..

The NPG site was  quite long offline and suddenly appeared again some times ago.
The site got again a bit of this special CARNERA touch with a nice animated java
applet as menue. Therefore the things the site offers are a bit sparse. The info
on the site is quite incomplete and  offers only parts  of the group history and
infos about a part of the members. Furthermore there is a little linklist, a few
downloads and a bunch of screenshots  for "Incubator", but in a version that was
not officially released, damn...

And that's  it already. There are  special members  pages by CYMRIC and CARNERA,
but those aren't Atari oriented.

Styling ... not bad and quite "designish" with animated java applets
Features .. a few incomplete infos, incomplete download area, pictures, links

status of the band ......... inactive/dead - last official release on Atari 1994
last update of the site .... dunno, but set online 2oo1 or 2oo2 again

I think I must  not tell  you much about  NEW TREND anymore  since I was able to
enlight a lot about  this old band back  in the past issue  with  my story about
"Where Are They Now". So I will make it short... NEW TREND itself was founded on
the ruins of THE SILVERBULLET FORCE back  in 1991/1992, on ST they never matched
it to make a real breakthrough  and was more or less in the headlines because of
its little quarrels  with other bands. As  LIG LURI  joined them in 1993 (he was
former known as Mr Pee of TCM) the band got its boost on the  Falcon and belongs
to the first Falcon demo groups along with LAZER, NPG and AURA at all.
Unfortunately this didn't went long and already 1994 the light was switched off,
as LIG LURY jumped onto the OS2 train to neverland...

Btw, the NEW TREND page was one of the first german Atari scene pages along with
the ACF page but since the band went away from the Atari it was set offline very
early too... Now LIG LURY brought  it back because of nostalgia, with completely
new design.
But the page  offers not much, the  informations are  incomplete  as well as the
downloads and those things starting mainly with the  time as LIG LURI joined. So
you can  just leech  their two Falcon demos  and see screenshots of their second
one. Interesting are just two included online games, one is a mine sweeper clone
and one a conversion of a game done by LoST of INTER many years back on ST, just
called "Quencher"... The  greetings on  the site are  running as java applet and
showing a vector ball scroller.

Styling ... quite own design, very clear and easy to navigate
Features .. incomplete infos and downloads, pictures, online games
Atari? .... only Atari related contents

status of the band ......... active
last update of the site .... 11.1o.o2

PARANOIA, yes, there was something, but please don't mix it up. There was a band
called PARANOIA on the ST in the early nineties, but this hadn't something to do
with the todays PARANOIA group since this one's history doesn't goes back so far
as I know. PARANOIA really started with the end  of SOLUTION SOFTWARE, in former
times PARANOID was the pixel man for  the games by  MAD BUTSCHER. It's first own
steps made PARANOIA with a bunch  of games releases  and a few small  intros and
since 2ooo  they're trying to make steps  into the Falcon  demo scene and can be
called to be a promising new comer there. Unfortunately  there are  movements in
the band to be open for more systems, esp. 8bit Commodore machines and x86 stuff
and so the flow of Atari releases suffers a bit under this movements.
There are still rumours  about some  new Atari stuff, such as a Commodore C16/+4
emulation for Atari machines as well as new demo stuff, but except the first one
nothing is verified.

The page itself is stuck into some heavy redesign atm, changing into hard black-
white painting and surely is a matter of taste, the only part that still is hold
in old style is the projects/releases  page, offering  downloads of all products
and infos about forthcoming releases.
Apart from this the site offers infos about the single  members, the forthcoming
PARACON 4 party, Atari hardware guides, a gallery of PARANOID's pixels, s little
page with  chip musix done  by their member  LUEBKE as  well as a huge greetings
list. The former quite outdated links list was removed completely.

Styling ... I don't like that hard black/white design, sorry
Features .. quite a lot, infos, downloads with screenshots, musix, pictures...
Atari? .... mostly Atari oriented, but the group will invade other systems
Surf On ... If you miss  some of their  productions, for sure, unfortunately the
            news aren't that pumping since last year anymore.

last update of the site .... dunno, the first one in march 2oo2

RISK... arf... This band never stepped  into the big light  of the scene, it was
more known  because of their  magnificent musician  RIPGUY and artist MC FLY but
their releases on ST mainly in  the early nineties, were  only mediocre. In fact
they released some  stuff under another  group name too, the INVALIDS. On Falcon
their  paths are even  smaller... As  far as I know  the name RISK was on Falcon
dragged into the light through DANNY O, MC FLY and RIPGUY with the compo entries
that mostly reached upper places. As so many others they're moved to PC lateron,
but I was quite happy as I saw DANNY O's attempts to create a page.

In fact, there was  already a  RISK page  set online  some time ago, but  it was
taken out of the  net, now there are  two pages  around. An old  one (the second
url) and a new one, but this one seems to be not finished or something, maybe my
browser  has  problems  dunno, but except  the  very  cool intro  with a fractal
landscape and a information page, nothing more is to come, anyway, I wrote about
it since the intro is worth watching.

The older page is quite  colourfull and offers a wide range of informations, two
old ST demos to download, member infos, links and a big bunch of musix by RIPGUY
TOMMY and DANNY O to  download. Unfortunately  the gallery  showing  pictures by
DANNY O and MC FLY is abandoned.
And, last but not least, the following sentence is quite dull "We are now coding
... on PC's as it seems that this will be the only computers that survive!!" Ba!
Again it  is quite dull  to see some guys that installed some name back in their
history moving into the wrong direction and, as the most others, loosing any way
of importance, also RISK never matched it to step back into the light as band...
I think this is some kind of compensating justice...

Styling ... Ok, quite colourfull, intro of the first page is nice
Features .. a few infos, demo and musix downloads, links, not much to add
Atari? .... Main parts yes, but read the sentence above...

THE CHAOS ENGINE wasn't very successfull on the scene, releasing just a bunch of
intros and  music compiles on the Falcon and later on some lame shareware cracks
I wont count  as true releases  here. They  have got  their  best  times  as the
members of BLUE SOFTWARE, another 3rd range band joined their lines that brought
one great guy  into the band, bITmASTER, a genious dsp coder, but as he left for
PSX development the short better time  of the band was over again... Nowadays or
better untill last year, the former BSW member THE BYTE appeared again and again
working on a big CD  compilation set  but since the  page wasn't updated anymore
and TB seems to be angry about a short sentence I wrote about the page in UCM 21
I think he went inactive too in the end.

The site itself appeared very late, as the band was dead already, now reanimated
for some huge CD collections projects, featuring rare demo and game collections,
those are maintained  by THE BYTE, too. The site doesn't blows you away with its
design (that was  never  a hightlite  of TCE or  BLUE SOFTWARE  releases, except
their  outstanding "Burning Water" intro from the Fried Bits 3) but therefore it
features a big download area, informations  about the CD collections projects, a
ripped links  list (from  the .tSCc. page) and  a few infos  and news  about the
site, where  THE BYTE claims that my short info in UCM 21 was the reason for him
to quit  as I didn't reported  the things better... I don't care about that fact
since I mentioned  only that the downloads were all bugged and since the site is
written in german only (and still is) it  isn't of big use for the foreign Atari
scene... anyway, you should surf on if you're missing some TCE releases and want
to dig out  some unreleased  antics... so far the BSW area isn't up and running,
but  this isn't  a real drawback since  the BSW compiles  always were 3rd or 4th
range...

Styling... a bit oldschoolish, black backgrounds, colourfull grafix...
Features.. some informations (in german), download  area with some antics, links
Atari?.... only atari related contents
Surf on... if you're  missing some  TCE productions  or want to help with the CD
           project and if you aren't in fear of german writings :)

status of the band ......... dead - last official release on Atari 1997
last update of the site .... 15.1o.o2

Last but  not least, the  homepage of my former band, .tnb. that  was set online
by FLASH who was the last joining  member and who  joined an already dying band.
.tnb. was founded 1o years ago  and it's main  reputation is  growing out of the
fact to be the  root of the UNDERCOVER MAGAZINE, firstly  started as german crap
talk  magazine. Short tries to start a demo carreer on ST died with the upcoming
Falcon and  all members changed  to this machine... .tnb. releases  always had a
strange kind of humour but the early split of the band in 1995 was the beginning
of the end while  loosing a third of  its members. 1996 and 1997 some nice demos
were done  too but loosing more members really and more members staying inactive
showed up the end of the band. Last coder DRIZZT appeared last time 1999, helped
MIKE of STAX to release his last ST demo, released an old demo from 1994 for the
fake compo at EIL'99 and since this time the band disappeared. FLASH seems to be
the only active survivor, supporting other groups with his pixels now.

The page  itself is  damn  cool  styled, offering  FLASH's  grafix  and a lot of
ripped stuff  too, but build  together in  a very nice  way. Apart from this the
page suffers under  FLASH's only works, so  the infos  about the  band and their
members are incomplete, the  download area  is saved with  a password (Arf!). So
there isn't much  to discover here, funny  are the old  news... .tnb. claimed to
work on a demo  called "EKO System 2" for example and tried  to give proove with
ripped and changed  screenshots from  TBL PC demos, hehehe. Unfortunately  those
screenshots were  removed. The download area offers a lot of party pictures from
different events but as said, you need a password there... And I haven't one :(

Styling ... quite cool, even with ripped grafix...
Features .. not much too talk about, incomplete infos, disabled downloads...

url ........................ òhttp://xtroll.ubuxe.de
maintained ................. Cyclone of XTroll
status of the band ......... dead since 1o years now
last update of the site .... dunno

XTROLL? Who the fuck is or was XTROLL? I wondered by myself as I  first stumbled
over this  band and their  site on the net. In  fact even if I was  a hard  demo
collector I can't remember  one of their  demos. XTROLL itself claimes that they
didn't released their  demos because they don't wanted that someone ripped their
code... huuh. And  so they  lived from the late  eighties  untill the  beginning
nineties, releasing a bunch of hardly mediocre demos  and... LETHAL XCESS, or at
least their member CYCLONE, who was responsible for the grafix and stuff...
Today there aren't actions  as XTROLL anymore, just  CYCLONE is around to create
some LETHAL XCESS 2oo2 thing but atm, I doubt that we will see it this year...

The page is very clean designed, showing a lot of screenshots, bringing a lot of
informations  about  the  band  and  their "non" releases, offering demos for to
download and links to check out. The page isn't a blaster at all but if you have
not  visited it  so far, just do it... demo  collectors  should find the  one or
other rare software antics there as well.

Styling ... Clean, easy to navigate and understand, but no burner
Features .. downloads, a bunch of informations about past and present
Atari? .... completely Atari related
Surf On ... if you miss something of the XTROLL releases...

And more? Unfortunately  not... In the time I was working on this article, a lot
of pages disappeared or changed their contents that much that there isn't a need
to list them  here anymore... such as the sites by Absence, Aura or Psychonomix,
to name just a few.

Sure, this  article ended  up in another  way I wanted, so I dropped the ratings
and tried to shrink  down the informations  to a better  digestible limit, after
all I'm a bit happy that a few pages disappeared since alone this "short" survey
is breaking a lot of space limits as we reached the 3o KB already...

Ok, peeps, if I have  forgotten a page please  contact me... even if I wont make
an update of this article, but I would include it in the online news area.
