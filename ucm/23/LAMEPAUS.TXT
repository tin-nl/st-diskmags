                       THE LAMERTEST - LET'S HAVE A BREAK
ñ--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello fellows... I know that several people enjoyed the last mags' Lamertest and
shame on  me that  I didn't  created  another one  in here. The  reason is quite
simple, in some way the old one was far to simple.

If you used  the disk version of UCM you  just needed a  few steps through it to
find out the right and false answers and you were easily able to chose the right
ones at your next try. That was a point some people  have critizised and since I
try to react on criticism, I thought long  about that problem and esp. about the
possibilities that the UCM shell offers.

In the online version it is far easier to find out what answer is right or false
since the  browsers already showed  up the title of  the linked text and since I
didn't  used  too cryptical  file names (Hey! I still have to find through it by
myself!) it was quite easy to make your way through the questions.

I think I have found  a way to avoid  a too easy  cheating next time at least in
the  disk version that  still offers the fact  to follow  the linked files after
saving the questions, but  I think that  is a damn dull work and I hope that any
scener is proud enough to try to step through the questions in the magazine...

Ok, the idea I have is  quite time consuming  and since I've  no nerves back atm
and don't want to delay the current issue much more, I decided to bring back the
lamertest with my new ideas about the file and link system in the next issue.

So long you just  can mail me some  questions and solutions for the next part of
the  lamertest. I  surely have enough  stuff in my  mind, but as always, òI don't
òwant  to  create  only a moondog-zine  with  moondog-reviews/reports/news/ideas/
òthoughts/lamertests/entertainment...ð And so even  some questions/answers for the
next issue would colour up the scenario a bit...

So go on and mail me...

ñmoondog@atari.org

Thanx in advance!
