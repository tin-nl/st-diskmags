                             MILLIWAYS 2K2 REPORT
ñ--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two weeks  ago I  suddenly  got the  message, that  another  Milliways will take
place. ñ"Yeah, another cool coding session!"ğ I thought.

To prepare the meeting, I tried to copy  the new demos  from the  Lato Lutzikow,
especially ò"Numen"ğ,  to the real hardware. After 3 hours I had to give up, cause
the loading always crashed at 97% :-// , maybe my MegaRAM 320KB extension is not
compatible, who knows.

So I picked up my ATARI 8 Bit an travelled to Bellheim.

I arrived  at  Friday around  17.00 o'clock. Besides  óMC Laserğ, óRayğ  was already
there and busy coding (what else, he is a ñreal coding maniacğ).

First I exchanged some news with óMC Laserğ. After that we had another look at the
ò"Numen"ğ demo from óTaquartğ at an emulator. The demo rooks every time!!!

Then the rest of ótSCcğ arrived: óSkyğ, óDynacoreğ and óRemoğ. Later óSageğ also came, but
without óLlamağ! ñA bit disappointing.

Now I  found  time  to  code  a  lot  on ò"Bremspunkt"ğ a  game for  the MultiJoy8
interface (8 Joysticks) for the 8 Bit. óRemoğ and óRayğ were coding on the next ótSCc
demo for the EIL3, óMC Laserğ finished the ò"Fading Twilight 6"ğ and a lot more will
come he promised. óSkyğ and óDynacoreğ were coding on the PC some SSL stuff.

We all wanted  to see the  óCOOL GIRLSğ release, but òMc Nobodyğ wanted to plug in a
VGA Adapter :-(

The hours flew  away and we  became hungry. So we went to the local Turkish food
shop. It was my ñfavorite  Bellheim d”ner shopğ, but  again I was  surprised, that
the Turkish pizza was more expensive than the kebab, strange area.

At 6 o'clock on  Saturday I  went to bed. I woke  up when óMarcStarğ  and óParanoid
from óParanoiağ appeared and setted up a òDreamcastğ.
After a coffee we continued  where we stopped  before. óSageğ did some nice things
on the òLynxğ, and told us some  ñinteresting newsğ from  the òLynx sceneğ. I had 4 MB
ram cartridges and played with some Mod routines.

Later the day óQuestorğ and óSamuraiğ arrived. We  discussed some non  ATARI related
topics, and óQuestorğ acted as a beta tester for ò"Bremspunkt"ğ.

óParanoiağ were leaving early.

At Sunday 4 o'clock I went to bed again. After I woke  up, we had some talkings,
and around  4 o'clock we finish. I droved  óRemoğ to the  Karlsruhe train station,
and went home also.

As all òMilliwaysğ  before again  it was ñvery  funnyğ. A lot of the people only met
once a year, so there was a lot to talk (and burn) about. ñThanksğ to óRayğ and óRemoğ
coding feeling was also present. Many thanks to óMC Laserğ for his ñgreat jobğ.
