                           NARSIL MAGAZINE... R.I.P.?!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article was thought to be finished for the last issue of UCM but in the end
I fucked up in finishing it. Since I had a bit more time then, I decided to show
up what happened  since the latest  ñNARSILð reviews in UCM, and this was issue 4o
in UCM # 21...

Since then  happened a lot... At  first, there  were 7 other  issues released in
this time, and at second, the magazine seems to be  dead! Yes, you've red right,
even if they announced they wanted to stop with issue 5o nothing happened on the
ñNARSILð  front  anymore. Issue 47, released  last year in  December was  the last
issue. Since then the ñNARSILð homepage, maintained  by òEMPTY HEADð closed down and
also no czech FTP server  is dealing with new  issues, just storing issues up to
the 47... Since I knew  that those  FTP servers were  updated regularly with the
release of a new issue, this  is a sign  that something  is going  wrong in  the
czech ST scene.

But after all, òEMPTY HEADð isn't responsible for the release of ñNARSILð alone, but
the czech team called òFAENð. Their  only release this year was a game, we already
mentioned in the last UCM, that is an adventure in czech language, created using
the STAC and called  ñLEKTVARð... So they  aren't vanished  completely, but  after
all it is a bit strange that they disappeared suddenly and unexpected.

Even if I still didn't  learned the  czech language, I'm  a bit sad  since those
magazines always  came along with  heavy grafix  contents, often  created by the
outstanding czech grafician òJS, Jiri Sladovnicð, who is  responsible for the most
grafix in  czech productions, just  as in  the most  ñNARSILð Magazines, the  game
ñPOWER UPð by  òMC SOFTð and  last but not  least for the still  unfinished and very
promising game project  ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð... Btw, I  have  collected a bunch of
informations, mixed up with a lot  of screenshots and grafix files of this game,
again, just  to show up, that  this game  isn't just a  little  rumour, but that
there are a lot of works done within the last years. Just follow the link below:

But back to ñNARSILð... Anyway, here we go with  short reviews  of the last issues
that were released over the last 1,5 years.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     ISSUE 41
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was the last release in 2ooo. This isse was again quite big, even if it all
was matching on one disk, but  with a size of  about 9oo KB it was of usual size
for the ñNARSILð one disk issues.

The mag itself starts with some scanned picture of mediocre quality, followed by
a short òFAENð animation by òJSð and some quite nice menu grafix, showing some space
stuff. This issue contains just 29 articles  and animations and as you remember,
ñNARSILð was a óshareware magazineð, so you  had to pay a bill, receiving a key code
to make the issue fully accecable... I didn't and so this issue was in this fact
one of the worst  ever since 11 articles  were for payers only this time! What a
shit, sorry to say that, but with nearly every second article disabled, it was a
damn short view...

The issue  featured the usual reviews of old games, like ñMOONSHINE RACERS, SUPER
ñSEYMOUR, CAVEMANIA, SKWEEK, ROBOKID, INSECT IN SPACE, DARIUSð and ñHORROR ZOMBIES.
Furthermore  there is a  special about SHADOW OF THE BEAST and you  get the game
solution for ñREALMS OF REALITYð as well as the maps of ñPOPISð (hu?).
Aside from the games corner, the magazine features the 5th part of  a HTML guide
and the second  part of an  Internet guide, a  report from the  óATARI HODY 2oooð,
some  comic pictures  of the makers of  the magazine, a  survey of  all reviewed
stuff so far and the usual adverts.

The goodies, that are coming along with  the magazine aren't very  brainblasting
this time  since there  are only  the whole  maps for  ñREALMS OF REALITYð in .SEQ
format.

What to say, ónot a very impressive issueð, from  the contents. I think I must not
mention that it is an even shorter view if you don't know one single czech word.
The ópresentation is quite okð, featuring several pictures and small animations as
well as a ógood menu graficð. Unfortunately  the didn't  changed the  problem with
the music so far, and so you  aren't able to listen to them, still, if you don't
own an Atari STE...

Overall? The big ammount of  disabled articles  knocks out  this issue, even for
         non czech people.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    ISSUE 42
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ñISSUE 42ð was their first release in 2oo1 and already showed up its drawback with
the shrinked filesize, since  it only  filled up  8oo KB this time, bringing  us
only 25 articles and animations now... On the disc there were a few goodies like
the demo version of ñCADAVERð, the ñMINESð game  that came along with  ñDNT PAPER # 6
some years ago, as well as some animation sequence of an old game.

While the loader picture is quite, errr..., shit, the menu grafix are again of a
good quality. The contents weren't as much for pay-per-read this time, only 6 of
the articles  and animations were  disabled, unfortunately a few I really wanted
to see, since this issue was the first since long times (last time in the middle
of the 3o issues) that was dealing with informations about the secret game thing
known  as  ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð  again, just  bringing  óscreenshotsð  and óanimation
ósequencesð again. But as said, the most were for pay readers only, too bad...

The mag  itself brings  only a few  reviews this  time, so  there are ñHARLEQUIN,
ñWELLTRIS, RUBICONð and ñTURN'N'BURNð. A big special is this time the ñCADAVERð thing,
with a review, solution with maps and a preview of a demo version.
Furthermore there is a  hardware article  included, that brings  some very small
snippets  of all the hardwares  that are in  development, such as MILAN 2, CT6o,
Phantom accelerator, Panther/2 board, Tempest card and DesTTiny board.
Other things to mention is  another web guide and  a little weird animation. The
rest is filled with the usual stuff like adverts and so on...

Overall? A bit smaller than the previous one but because of the quite new ñBLOUMA
         snippets óvery interestingð... Too bad that I couldn't read something :/

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   ISSUE 43
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a record breaking issue! The presentation was quite ok, with  a scanned
picture from the ALIEN movie  as loader and another spacy menu grafix. The thing
that impressed me here, is  the fact that the  911 KB on the disk  are filled up
with more than 5o articles and animations, record as far as I know for the mag!
Even the fact that 16 articles and animations were disabled doesn't minimize the
massive release.

The magazine features as highlite, another big animation  corner, dealing with a
lot of presentation animations for òEMPTY HEADð, òMC SOFTð and óDRAKONISð (Dunno). All
were done by òJSð again and partly very nice stuff!
On the articles side the mag features again a big bunch of game reviews, such as
ñSUPER SKWEEK,  TERRAMEX,  SPACE RACERS, TIME RACEð  and  ñVIDEO KIDð, furthermore a
review of ñINDIANA JONES 3ð as well as the solution and level maps of the game.
On the more serious side  it goes on with the Internet  guide, an  article about
the ñXTOS projectð, a review of ñSTEEMð and some guide about the disk structures.
There are also  different reports of  the óATARIADA partyð  included, coming along
with several pictures of the party, but unfortunately in bad quality.

Of lesser interest, esp. for not czech readers, is a literature experiment but I
really don't know what  is it all about and so it doesn't matter to me that four
of them were disabled. The  rest is filled up  with the usual  stuffs, that were
already mentioned before, so there are several adverts (for the new òATARIADAð).

Last but not least, the goodies, that featuring a game  called ñSKAMPYð and a .SEQ
file containing a slideshow from the óATARIADA partyð.

Overall? From the contents it is óone of the strongest issuesð and features also a
         óquite stunning ammount of new grafix and animations!

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      ISSUE 44
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What issue 43 matched  to build up, was  issue 44 breaking  down again. Not only
that the presentation lost a bit with the not so  well done loader picture, nope
over all the contents were very disturbing, not even the half of issue 43... and
still a lot of articles  disabled (8 this time). But  after all the mag fills up
over 9oo KB again... maybe this belonged to the goodies, the game ñSQUARE OFFð and
a small utility for ñN.AES.

The presentation of  the menu is quite nice and so we have a screenshot here for
you...

{*i NARSIL44.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

Looks good, or what do you think?

Ok, the contents itself are again ruled by the games part. So  there are reviews
of ñBARBARIAN 2, SUPERMAN, DISC, SPEEDBALLð and  ñLEGEND - SON OF EMPIREð,  followed
by  solutions  for the games  ñTERRAMEXð and ñFINAL COMMANDð as  well as  an article
about the game ñCOLORADOð.

The rest of the magazine features articles  about czech  softwares, a web guide,
an article about the FAT's of disx, another  óATARIADA 2oo1 reportð, new  invented
also a PC corner, an announcment for the óATARI HODY 2oo1ð, and last but not least
the usual stuff like adverts and so on.

Overall? óA quite disturbing  issueð after  the fat  volume 43... Goes well in the
         NARSIL range at all.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    ISSUE 45
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if you think this  was the deepest point, you're wrong, since this issue was
even a bit smaller with  just 82o KB and only  24 articles. But what  this issue
lacked on the contents (in parts), it was matching  with its ónice  design againð,
since loader and menu  were óquite nice designedð, esp. the load&depack grafix are
óvery nice lookingð! The goodies featuring this time the demo of the game  ñTHE SPY
ñWHO LOVED MEð and a STOS game called ñBYTEMANð.

The contents of the  magazine are again quite  game dominated, and so  there are
reviews  of  ñTHE SPY WHO LOVED ME, POWER CUT, DIZZY LIZZY, BANK BUSTER, SNOWBALL
ñIN HELLð and the  solution of  ñFINAL COMMANDð. And as  we are on the games side, I
want to mention that this issue features again a bunch of informations about the
game  ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð, since  several sprite  banks and  tech  specs for  the
sprites were included. óYummi, that makes me hungry for more!

The  serious parts  of the  magazine is  filled up with the  usual web guide, an
article about the ADSL techniques, MPEG files, the PC  corner and a party report
by òMAD BUTSCHERð that's english/german counterpart can be found in ñUCM # 22ð...

Overall? Yeps, a short thingies but very interesting since again some stuff from
         ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð popped up...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     ISSUE 46
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next issue is  a bit bigger again, but  features again one article less than
the previous one. So we are  at 23 articles and  animations now. óUghð. The loader
picture of this  issue is damn  ugly but therefore  the menu grafix  are of good
quality again... here we go...

{*i NARSIL46.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

On the goodies side I had to wonder, since it contained some hints for Win95, an
Atari link list and a file called KONGO.PRG that bombs away. Stunning :/

The contents are quite small, apart from the usual big games corner that is this
time  stuffed with  ñDEVIOUS DESIGNS, ASTERIX, HUDSON HAWK, PURSUIT TO EARTHð  and
ñDOUBLE BOBBLEð.

Apart from the games only another web guide appeared, together with the usual PC
corner, an party  report from  the óATARI HODYð that  comes along  with  quite bad
pictures (nothing heared of dithering so far?), but to enlighten this situation,
the  magazine brings  another stunning  ñBLOUMA'S ADVENTUREð part, including a lot
of sprite banks, in game animations and such stuff! óCoool!

Overall? Except the ñBLOUMAð part a óvery weak issueð, and wouldn't be the big infos
         about the game in here, it would be ówasted diskspaceð... sorry.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     ISSUE 47
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if you think we have reached the bottom, you're still wrong, since this, and
it seems to be the ólast issueð, one  can go much more down. It comes along with a
filesize of not even  5oo KB, with only 19 articles and  animations where also 6
are disabled again, and a quite small  goodies folder, that  deals with the disk
labels for the ñLEKTVARð game, the manual for ñLEKTVARð and the czech ressource file
for ñGEMJINGð, a GEM sample player.

While the loader picture brings an advertisment of the ñLEKTVARð game, that I have
also mentioned somewhere at  the beginning of this  article, the menu grafix are
of a good quality again, ónot high end, but good,ð showing a pixeled queen.

This time there is only one game review in here, about ñLOCOMOTIONð. Quite strange
if we remember to all the game  reviews in older  issues. The small rest  of the
contents  includes another  PC article, 3 animations, book reviews, a  report of
the óATARI HODYð again and the usual stuffs like adverts and so on...

Overall? óSlimfast issue? Starved to death then?ð Dunno, it  was the last  one and
         one of the most uninteresting ones... too bad...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, and  here we  stand. Issue 47 was released  in December last year, the next
one had to follow at the end of February or beginning of March, but I browsed to
the web page  and didn't found  anything... It didn't took very long  untill the
page was removed from the net... So what happened?

As it seems the makers didn't got much  support anymore, even if ñNARSILð was done
by a core of  Atarians that were  involved in all issues. But somewhere must lay
the reason  that the ammount  of articles shrinked  in the last half year of its
existence. Maybe the producers have  lost the interest in going on with it since
the czech scene was never very big and also shrinking, maybe they didn't got the
mentioned support again, or  maybe the mag was dying because of the pay-per-read
concept.

A big drawback for them was the czech language used in  the magazine since so it
was only from interest by  czech readers and got  only support by them and since
this scene was always quite small, it maybe wasn't able to  support a bi-monthly
magazine anymore. I don't  know, but I want to  say that the Atari diskmag scene
has lost some colours if it has died really.

After all I really wanted to know what happened  to ñNARSILð magazine and if there
is anyone who can tell me, please don't hesitate to mail me!
