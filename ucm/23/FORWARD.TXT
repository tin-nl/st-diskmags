                  LOOKING FORWARD TO ISSUE # 24 OR SOMETHING
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know, it is always  a bit dull to announce  something, esp. since  I must drop
several planned articles for  this issue. But since  I'm already working on some
stuff that  just doesn't fits into  this one here anymore, I'm at least in parts
able to make you hungry for more...

At first, the next issue will  be released around XMAS this year, that is a fact
and I will do all to  hold this. It's just a question if it will be a full issue
or just a  Xmas special and so its up to  you as well... the more support I get,
the more save is a fully stuffed issue, if not you will get a slimfast irregular
issue that will not be counted in the regular row of UCM issues.

Ok, things that are planned for the forthcoming issue...

ñ+ The heavy support  by CHUCK of DUNE brought  me to the point  to work out some
ñ  DUNE special. In fact I have  already written down  several parts but the fact
ñ  that I didn't got two interviews in time or not  at all and the  fact that I'm
ñ  running out of  space, brought me to the  point to delay it for the next issue
ñ  to make better use of the UCM features. After all there is still some research
ñ  to be done and so  the "pause" untill XMAS is good  as well... So it is a fact
ñ  that the XMAS issue will stay under DUNE banner over all!

ñ+ Another thing that was already started  is that I will  dive with you into the
ñ  abyss of hungarian  software antics. I got hold  of several items  the most of
ñ  you maybe never heard of before. It isn't new stuff at  all, but maybe new for
ñ  us aka the ones who never knewed before that this software existed at all.

ñ+ I will go on with the "Where are they now?" series. In fact I had focused onto
ñ  some people but the lack of time and motivation have hold me back in realising
ñ  it... its a big bunch of research to do and without motivation it is a pain in
ñ  the ass and surely wouldn't end up as it should...

ñ+ At last I will check out  in what way Christmas has  brought the Atari sceners
ñ  in the past and present to do something for their beloved machines.

ñ+ And last but not least the LAMERTEST will be back, as written I'm working on a
ñ  new system that should avoid to easy cheating and I think I'm on the right way
ñ  atm... just have to try it out :)

That's it for the features I have in mind and work already. There is surely some
more to come... ofcourse you're warmly welcome if you have something to add! Get
in touch with me!
