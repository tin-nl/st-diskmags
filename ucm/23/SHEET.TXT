 ( ) It runs perfectly at the first try!
 ( ) I'm reading only the online version!

How long do you read on it?

 ( ) I'm just browsing through the contents and quit.
 ( ) If it is interesting I need a few hours!
 ( ) I skip always a lot of articles, maybe one hour.
 ( ) I always read all articles, it doesn't matter about what topic... so I need
     a long time!
 ( ) I often read articles twice and more.

What parts are most interesting?

 ( ) All about the scene and demostuff!
 ( ) Games, as those are my main interest!
 ( ) The latest coding hints!
 ( ) All the online stuff since so I mustn't brows to all homepages by myself...
 ( ) The mixed articles are interesting, it mustn't be computer stuff all day.

What kind of articles do you want to see more?

 ( ) Scene, scene, scene! News, Interviews and stories! Yawn!
 ( ) I would like to read more reviews, esp. of tools and stuff!
 ( ) The mixer could have more contents!
 ( ) Where are the XXX stories, eh?
 ( ) I'm always on the hunt for more coding tips!
 ( ) I really miss some humour!

Are there articles you aren't that interested in?

 ( ) There mustn't be that much reviews! I'm building my own view!
 ( ) Why are online related articles in a diskmag?
 ( ) The whole mixery doesn't catch me much, I'm a scene fanatic!
 ( ) The scene area is blown up too much! I don't stick that deep in it...
 ( ) If you ask me so the current mix is quite ok...
 ( ) Who needs coding hints! I'm tormenting my DSP and CPU by myself!

What do you think about the reviews...

 ( ) They're quite in depth written and help me  always to decide  if some thing
     is worth to get or not!
 ( ) They're much too short and often they don't cover my own impression!
 ( ) The screenshots  aren't needed  since I leech  them anyway  to build my own
     view about them!
 ( ) Reviews are wasted time in my opinion!
 ( ) I like them always but I would like to see some more moderate ratings!
