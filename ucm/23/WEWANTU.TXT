                                 WE WANT YOU!

Hu? What's this? It's  quite simple, since I got a lot of feedback but only very
few support this time I thought to ask you as reader what you think about UCM at
all. Therefore I have prepared  a votesheet with  multiple choice  questions you
should fill out and send back untill 2o.12.2oo2.

The reason for doing this isn't only the support only, but I really want to know
what things  on UCM you like or  dislike, what you  want to  see in UCM and what
isn't of any interest for you, what we could make better and so on.

Furthermore I want to know more about you, as regular reader of UCM, what system
you're using, for what you're using it, how long do you know and read UCM and so
on.

So just fill  out the votesheet  and send it back  in time. Even if the feedback
forced me to go on, the ignorance in support  and help throws me back  again and
so the incoming filled votesheets are  also something like a  barometer how good
or bad my  work is and if there  is a need to  go with UCM  even under such hard
problems with missing support.

So this opionion poll  isn't only thought to make the UCM better if possible, no
but also  to see if it has still  a future. It is  thought to motivate me appart
from the usual  feedback letters and to take  the consequences, weither to go on
or to end it before it's going to be  only a pain for  me since it isn't easy to
fight against lazyness and ignorance and it costs a lot of power, power that may
be lost after all...

So go ahead and fill out the opion poll sheet now...
