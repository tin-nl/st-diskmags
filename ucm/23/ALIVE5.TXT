Since ñALIVEð has found some regular steps for releasing new issues it wasn't that
promising that  a new issue would hit  the street before the summer was going to
burn us down. After some starting problems  óSTSð and his team matched it to bring
us another  òfull blown  issueð in the end and I just  want to say  it right here,
that surely is setting another top of the issues...

A thing that makes this  issue òvery interestingð  is the fact that it comes along
with òtwo introsð, one by óRAYð with help of óNEMOð, óHAVOCð and óSTSð and one by óDEEZð who
included a music by óTOODELOOð in his one. Ofcourse óRAYð did ST bits while óDEEZð was
cleaning up his harddisk for a òFalcon introð. RAY's intro is a truly rocking thing
btw...

But this brought us some  problems as  well since the  big DATA files òblows away
òany disk frontiersð. Not only that no goodies or  anything else was included, no,
also Falcon and ST version came separate out, including the special intros each.

Unfortunately here I have to bring on a òsmall point of criticismð since the Fo3o-
version didn't  contains  the ST intro (that runs  on Falcon too). I  think a ST
version  without  the Falcon intro but a  Falcon version with  both intros would
have done  the job a bit better here  since so you  needed to leech both version
just because of the intros then if you're a Falcon owner...

Anyway... The big data file is giving me dripping teeth since it shows that this
issue is damn big  packed. After loading the magazine a nice far east styled pic
by óEDOð comes up, saying ñALIVEð... Take a look at it here...

{*i ALIVE5A.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

òTypical EDO style, eh?! ;)

Then a òfunny tracking musicð comes up, made  by óTOODELOOð (since I was running the
Falcon version) and the menu  was loading. It shows  some quite òclean styled gfx
by óEXOCETð, using some wooden textures and a few bugs to fill it up with colours.
Btw... You surely know  the possibility to  listen to the ST musix on the Falcon
as well while switching off the Falcon sound. But where the hell was the "Music"
button? Damn... like an  idiot I thought STS has taken  the "Falcon version" too
much on the word and skipped the ST musix in this version... but I recovered the
ST musix by hint ;)

{*i ALIVE5B.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

òYou have to click onto the bug below to change the musix... :)

The range of the ST musix is filled up by the same team that has done the musics
for this issue  of UCM as well and  the names óTAOð, ó5o5ð and óNEMOð are standing for
themselves: òcool chipsounds without compromises.
A òlittle drawbackð is the fact that óTOODELOOð's music seems to be bugged out since
after  short playing time it  slows down  giving just  one tone  by another away
without melody or something.

Ok, back to  the magazine. A short scroll  down of the menu  offers a content of
òabout 7o articlesð, covering, ALIVE-a-like a lot of Atari and scene related stuff
as well as it contains a òbig  non computer oriented partð  that was mainly filled
up by óCIHð who's besides óSTSð the main man behind ñALIVEð. Besides  those two guys a
lot of other writers are  on board, many  with just one  article, but this gives
some more colours too. After  all it is  nice to see óFELICEð  back on the writers
area, even if he didn't brought in as much stuff as he  did for ñMAGGIEð, but he's
up and writing again and òthat is what countsð. Also óPARANOIDð and óMARSSð are teamed
up again and on óPARANOIDðs hand his  articles are the only  lifesigns of óPARANOIA
on Atari since long time at all.

So let's  go for a  òcloser lookð  onto the contents... After the  regulars with a
splitted editorial by the two main editors credits and stuff ñSTSð is giving  away
some  personal views  onto the  things  that  were  going on  in France  for the
election of the premier minister  as it was no secret  for non froggies that the
ultra right wing  politician (semi facistic) LePen popped  up again to  get this
job and with Chirac no  better choice was around since he's a quite conservative
guy as well... But let's skip the politics (even if  it's a must  to express the
own meaning if you have a possibility) and go on for the òreal interesting stuff,
òAtari stuff.

The scene corner is òquite smallð, covering a few news  snippets that don't reveal
too much  as there isn't  much happening  on the scene, a  party calendar (where
have I seen  that before?! Hint, hint!) for  Atari  events, some  reports of the
MEKKA party including a funny CIH original, the MEKKA MINIMAG... Always nice for
a laugh :)

Later on the reason  for the small scene  corner came up in  form of an òseparate
òinterview cornerð, featuring interviews with óCYCLONE of  XTROLLð (the maker of the
ñLETHAL XCESS 2oo2ð project), óNERVE from  EPHIDRENAð (or  óCreatorsð, or óEffectð or...
something else), óFEL'Xð who claims to be  founder and leader of óMJJ PRODð and also
with óMORGAN of FANTASYð, another  oldschooler from the  golden ST demo days. It's
all in one a òquite interesting readð, only óMARSSð' collection of  interview snipps
with the Jaguar developpers óJDCð wont match to the part really.

The final snippets of that part are a hardware test by òEVILð who reviews the ñIDE-
ñSCSI adapterð and a ñdemo tutorialð  by óDEEZð who explains  things about FPU, Videl,
memory and so on.

The magazine goes on  with a review of the latest scene productions, such as the
demos from  the ñMEKKAð and some later released stuffs, like óSTAXð' intro and óMJJð's
slideshow. Not  much to  tell you here, just  that óSTSð  was swinging  an axe and
kicked some of them into the trashcan... òyau, I like that :)
òUrg...ð then I saw that  ñUCM 22ð was reviewed as well, this time by óCIHð and he did
a òfairly in deepth jobð and after  reading through it, I was  quite pleased and I
saw that the way I'm moving on seems  to be more stable  now :) òBeing the badass
òof the scene all  times isn't that cool, but after all truth has to be truth and
òshit is shit and we have freedom of free speech and meaning...

Back  to the  ñALIVEð front... óSTSð is  gathering  some  reasons  for ñ"Why I didn't
managed to sent in my article"ð that is a òquite  funny one tooð, followed  by some
mixed  articles, just  reviews of ñ"ACE"ð and  a short  snipped  about  the latest
version of ñ"SAINT"ð, a review (!) of the ñEIL'99 videoð and some homepage infos.

The games area is filled with  a review of  ñGODPEYð written by óDMA SCð that offers
several  faked screens (hehehe) since I  doubt that  he has reached  such a high
level  in the puzzle area ;)  The ò"latest"ð ñGODPEYð scores  were included  as well
but here  I think òit's uselessð  esp. since in  that early  stage the scores were
changing nearly every day.

Furthermore  you can find  besides a review of  the óRES GODSð Juggling game and a
review  of ñ"HEARTLAND"ð and the ñGame & Watchð  thingies, also  articles  about the
latest developments on the Jaguar sector as well as reviews of some Lynx things,
just as ñAVPð again (this time in  comparison to my article in ñUCM # 22ð with a few
nice screenshots). This  section is  rounded up with  an outbreak from the Atari
scene, since also ñALIVEð is going to leave the way from  Atari only reporting, so
we can find articles about  the ñGAMECUBEð and the ñDREAMCASTð (where óPARANOIDð seems
to be hard addicted to). Furthermore  óPARANOIDð is  taking  a look  at videogames
that were  ahead of their time  and so we can  read interesting  stuff about the
ColecoVision, Lynx, Jaguar and Dreamcast, who all failed in the end...

The magazine closes down with the òusual miscellaneousð section that is quite full
this time, gathering about one third  of the contents  of the whole magazine. So
you will find DVD and movie  reviews (Tron, The Cell, Starwars Episode 2) and as
always a lot of mind melting thoughts  and funny articles by óCIHð who is going to
create his own mag within ñALIVEð here since  he ports all the  things that he was
doing in ñMAGGIEð to ñALIVEð here and in several parts òit's a good laugh.

And so the topics  are just something  like that: ñ"Cooking For Idiots"ð, Starwars
in óCIHð's òunbeatable ASCII versionð and to feed the hype at all, with óCIHð's latest
minimag, this time dedicated  to the death of Queen Mum that òreally rocksð :) The
ideas óCIHð is  bringing in here are so  òfunnyð, just like the ñ"Heart-O-Meter"ð that
shows the popularity of Queen Mum, Margarete and Di(e)... yawn. I think CIH must
stay anonymous or it could be that some royals will kill him for that...

Yo, so I stepped through it in the end and so it's time for the usual...

ófinal words... ñALIVE 5ó is another  good issue that matched  it to top the former
ó               one quite  tight. The  contents  are again  very interesting  and
ó               since many other people gave their  hand, even if the  result was
ó               mostly just one or two  articles  quite various. This  time there
ó               weren't as much Internet ripps included and this brightens up the
ó               whole thing a  bit more since we  aren't reading  ñST OFFLINEó here
ó               but the  number one contender :) Drawbacks are  just the  strange
ó               packs of the Falcon version (without ST intro) and the small demo
ó               and game areas but since the scene  is quite  silent since longer
ó               time now, it isn't ñALIVEó's fault and wont be rated here.
ó               Really rocking is  the fact of  two included  intros (check their
ó               separate reviews!) that wont be beaten in the next time I think.

ó_ñratingsó________________________________________________________________________
contents........  85 % - again a nice read, some really interesting articles...
shell........... ------- what to say, the same as ours ;) no rating!
shell grafix....  8o % - nice idea by Exocet
shell musix.....  9o % - good (but buggy?) module and rocking chip noises
loader pic......  8o % - and another Edo pixel stuff... nice one as always (?!)
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
overall.........  84 % - òat least 1% better than ALIVE 4 :)
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since ñUCMð and ñCHOSNECKð  still didn't  found a real regular way of release times,
ñALIVEð is the òmost regular output of the nowadays  ATARI (demo) sceneð and I think
óCIHð and óSTSð have still something left for us this year ;)
