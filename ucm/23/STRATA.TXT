              Interview with Stratagem of Animal Mine/Reservoir Gods
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UCM......... Hi Stratagem... it's  quite  a long  time  ago that you disappeared
             with Animal Mine and now you're back with the Reservoir Gods...
             What have you done in all those years?

ÒStratagem... Yeah, that's right - end of  1996/97 the  activities at Animal Mine
Ò             going down  very  fast, MC moved  to the  Army, Sethos, Titan, Zaxx
Ò             continued study  and I've worked for U.S.Robotics developing Modems
Ò             and ISDN Cards. Until I  left USR in October 1998 there was no free
Ò             time left for doing much stuff...

UCM......... Since it is quite silent  around Animal Mine  since years now, just
             tell us what happened  to the band and if it is a closed chapter to
             you or will you go on and feed the hype?

ÒStratagem... As I  told you  before - some  of  us keep  on study, No More  does
Ò             professional  music and finally  some of Animal Mine founded an own
Ò             Company. So, no-one  really  wanna  do  anything for A.M. - in this
Ò             case, A.M. is history now.
Ò             I changed the  provider which  was hosting our domain and and these
Ò             peoples are  stupid as bread, they d idn't get it work. Somewhen if
Ò             it works again, there will be a Animal Mine-website on the net...

UCM......... Are there still some unfinished things around from Animal Mine that
             will hit the  streets somewhen? I  just remember  to  MC's clean up
             that brought us a bunch of nice screens.

ÒStratagem... Yes, Future Composer  was one of  these lost  bits, MC also coded a
Ò             small  game in  the past (you won't  see it!), Sid Sound Designer 4
Ò             and some demo stuff. I'm not sure if we ever released "Red Ears 2",
Ò             if not, it's also to put into this cathegory...

UCM......... Since the  "Red Ears" demo  from Animal Mine  appeared on the PC as
             well I wonder if there  were movements in the band to change to the
             PC?

ÒStratagem... Only MC moved  to the  PC to  code, and "Red Ears PC" was  done for
Ò             Cebit 1997, released  on  the USRobotics booth (very  pure  code in
Ò             pascal!). No other  releases  have been  done on PC under the label
Ò             "Animal Mine". Who  wanna code  on a PC? This  question sounds more
Ò             than pervert :-)

UCM......... Some bands  around were  resurrected, even  if sometimes only a few
             screens or one demo were the result, do you think the same could be
             possible with Animal Mine too?

ÒStratagem... Sure, this  would be  a way for us  too - but - who  should  code a
Ò             screen? I don't  code - and I will not hire someone (like I've done
Ò             for GSC 66) from another  crew to  make a guest  screen for us in a
Ò             demo. This doesn't make sense, don't you agree?

UCM......... Are you  holding  contact to  the one or other or have you lost the
             connections to them?

ÒStratagem... Some contacts  are lost  during the  past, but with  the others I'm
Ò             still in touch (like Sethos, Zaxx, No More).

UCM......... To close the  Animal Mine  part, what  things  are  stuck  in  your
             memories most, about your times in the band?

ÒStratagem... The performance. Everytime  to kick  the people  doing some stuff -
Ò             it makes me mad!

UCM......... After some quiet years you're popping up as member of the Reservoir
             Gods again... how it comes that you joined them?

ÒStratagem... After a long  long time I  installed my IRC client again and joined
Ò             the #atariscne channel  and met some people from the past. I talked
Ò             to  this  crazy  coder "Mr.Pink" of  RG. We  talked  about  several
Ò             things, also  about the new  upcoming game "GODPEY". He asked me to
Ò             join the testing  group, so I joined and found lotsa bugs (he hates
Ò             me for doing this). Finally, the game has been released and I asked
Ò             them to join RG - they agreed. Now, I'm a god :-)

UCM......... What is  your main job in RG and are there first fruits of your job
             around there?

ÒStratagem... Mhm... major  thing  would  be finding  the bugs in our productions
Ò             before we release them, some graphical stuff too (if needed), maybe
Ò             some PR stuff, I think  this  will  move  in future, so  nothing is
Ò             totally fixed atm.

UCM......... How runs  the work  with RG, since  it isn't that easy to make some
             meetings to work together on some production?

ÒStratagem... The contact  is very good - some stuff comes by email, we have also
Ò             an own web-based  development  group  and finally  we have  the IRC
Ò             where we can talk together (I talk, Mr.Pink has to code :-))

UCM......... Can  you  tell us  some  snippets  about  future  projects  of  the
             Reservoir Gods, just make a bit propaganda here! ;)

ÒStratagem... We're  currently  short before  releasing the  game "SuperFly", and
Ò             there are  more than 10 projects in queue. One of these projects is
Ò             another conversion  of a Dreamcast  title - but I will not tell you
Ò             the name atm, we like to have secrets...

UCM......... Reservoir Gods  have released a bunch of impressive Falcon stuff in
             the past, nowadays  the slogan "all machines go" seem  to rule. Was
             the Falcon a way that Animal Mine don't wanted to go?

ÒStratagem... Some of the last A.M. releases worked on Falcon as well, but one of
Ò             our problems was, not everyone at A.M. owns a Falcon. Sethos, Titan
Ò             and myself  owning a  Falcon, but  MC doesn't. But MC together with
Ò             Sethos have been  the main-coders and  this doesn't make it easy at
Ò             all (pls don't ask me about coding stuff).
Ò             So, we wanted - but finally we can't - but Reservoir Gods can!

UCM......... What do  you think  about the  nowadays Atari  scene? Consists this
             scene only of  nerds that didn't matched it to change the system at
             the right time? ;)  What do you  like on this  scene that much that
             you're still here?

ÒStratagem... The scene  changed totally  in my eyes. Only a bunch of old crews /
Ò             people are left, some new crews are around. Tell me one good reason
Ò             why you wanna buy a PC? You get "MS WindowsXP" - wow. You can write
Ò             letters with  a PC? You can  do this  also with  old  Atari. Better
Ò             games? Right, but for better games I go and buy a console...

UCM......... You surely  know our brainstorm  area... So here we go with another
             one, I'll  give you a few  words and you just write down the things
             coming into  your mind while  reading them, just  answer with a few

Ò             life...

             aren't a cool dude?
