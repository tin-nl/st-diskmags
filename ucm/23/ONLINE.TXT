Here  we go  again  with  another bunch  of snippets  about new homepages, major
updates and so on...

ÒABSENCE.DE

- At last STALLION's homepage, the last  lifesign  of ABSENCE.DE in  the net was
  closed down... But since ABSENCE is inactive  on Atari since  5 years now  and
  this page was more a personal one, it isn't a real loss.

ÒATARI ROMS CHEST

- This games  related site closed  down because of quarrels with the ISDA. Since
  the site is  located in Germany it  was a must to set the downloads offline to
  avoid bigger problems...
