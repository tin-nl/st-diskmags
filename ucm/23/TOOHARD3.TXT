ñThe Animkomialsð are quite a while around already but it seemed to be quiet from
them over the  last few years. Now they came back to life with a new demo, this
one.

At first some  chip music starts to play while you can  see a slightly animated
robot moving towards you on the screen... òthe music sounds quite dull at first,
òthen  it  goes madð, a logo  of the  band appears, followed  by a big  scrolling
"presents" and a title logo...

Then some stuff like ó"years passed... blabla, we're back... blabla... we're the
óbest"ð comes up... eh? Really? That  reminds me hard  to the touch  of some fake
demos, so will it be such a thing? òHopefully not!

Then the first  effect comes up, showing some green texture and the saying ó"We'
óre better than Gumi"ð in the background while 4 environment mapped torrusses are
moving in... then the  screen turns to red  colours and you can see three times
more  of the torusses  now! òThat is  really amazing!ð So it  is at least no fake
demo since it offers some real demo stuff here...

óAarg... again something static...

The screen blinks  to white, showing ó"We're also better than Kr”ger"ð... hu? Who
is Kr”ger?! Then the  whole screen turns black, the music starts to go more and
more mad and a complete vector city comes in turning around on the screen, with
little houses  and even a church, all hold in grey colours. This screen is very
nice, òthe vectors are fast but not very detailedð.

And another screen is going to come, òshowing a realtime morphð, morphing Michael
Jackson into Osama bin Laden... arg... and then into Wasko. In this case I have
to say  that a morph  is something  different since  there aren't much morphing
steps here you could make a little slideshow out of the steps as well...

Another screen  is going  to come, announced  as voxelspace  but there an error
message  appears, saying something  about windows  but all in polish so I can't
follow it and so it's time for the last screen, showing a mediocre logo (with a
big ammount of colours in the background), their homepage adress and a vertical
scroller and this one reminds me hard to some fake demo scrolls and messages on
the ST and Falcon since it uses òthe same dull slangð and òa bit tastelessð are the
greetings to ñOsama of the W.T.C. groupð and the ñ"Alquaida Catholics"ð...

But after  all esp. that  last scroller  gives me  proove that  this demo isn't
meant  very  earnest and something  like an  8bit fake  demo since  the alltime
running ó"We're the best!"ð slogans  can't meant  earnest since  the demo doesn't
rock as much as so many other demos around.

ñfinal words... ò"Too Hard 3"ð surely  isn't a  bad demo, but  the mix out of fake
ñ               and real  demo leaves  a bad taste. The offered demo effects are
ñ               not bad while the fake parts  are a bit  too dull and tasteless.
ñ               This mix gives the demo  a hard stand esp. since there is nearly
ñ               no straight design included and all looked like smashed together
ñ               from different sources... To be the best it needs a bit more...
