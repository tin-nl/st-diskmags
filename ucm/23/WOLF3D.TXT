                         WOLFENSTEIN 3D - SOON ON YOUR ST
Ú--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, welcome back in the  second part of the  PROPAGANDA for .tSCc., this time it
is special dedicated to ...

{*i WOLF1.PI1 m 0 20 0 200}

ÒPlease think that this is a downscaled screenshot...

At the moment  I haven't  much to review  about "Wolfenstein", our  coder RAY's,
heartblood. Just this... So far the game engine runs quite fast on a ST and very
fast  on  Falcon, ofcourse. In  fact "Wolfenstein" will  be the  first 1stperson
shooter on the STFM (!) that can be called so and is using the machines techs to
the edge. The few other games around  using texture  mapping suffered under very
sparse and coarse textures, slowness, missing colours and so on.

So RAY's attempt to convert "Wolfenstein" can be  called the  first real attempt
to bring an ego  shooter with texture  mapping 3d engines  to the ST in all it's
possible glory, and that is, after all still very well playable.

So far only  the 3D engine is  running and there  isn't much of the  game itself
implemented, but  the development  is going  strong  in comparison  with so many
other game  projects on the  ST and everytime  we see  a new test  version, more
features are implemented.

Anyway... here's what RAY plans and thoughts about the future...

Ò- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- completely finished:  wall-environment refresh, including  animated doors  and
                        pushwalls. The  walls get  rendered at  16.16 fixedpoint
                        accuracy, and still it runs at up to 15fps on a plain ST

- partly finished:      controls, keyboard  movement  works  just  like  in  the
                        original game, mouse and joystick support need yet to be
                        added.

- still to be included: statics, such  as pickable  bonus items, bodies, tables,
                        pillars etc. that's  what I am  working on at the moment
                        and that's what the next beta will be all about.
                        Implementing this includes visibility detection, sorting
                        transformation  and clipping + additional masked scalers
                        as any of the  sprites' pixels will  need to be markable
                        as transparent (colorkey!). I guess this  will  drop the
                        framerate  a  bit, depending  on how  many  objects  are
                        visible at a time, however.

                        moving objects i.e. enemies. having inmplemented statics
                        once, those  shouldn't be too  hard to add. Nevertheless
                        that's not all because they need to be controlled, which
                        means:

                        a game  engine  emulating  the  enemies  brains is still
                        missing, too then :). In  my opinion  this  will  be the
                        hardest  part of the  game as it doesn't have to control
                        the enemies only, but additionally needs to check if our
                        bullets  have hit  the enemy, if  it's dead, if  we  are
                        dead, it  has  to count  our  score, control  our  items
                        (keys, weapons) and  so on. So again this might drop the
                        framerate, although I'll  try optimizing this as much as
                        possible just like with the finished features, before.

                        sound-sample  replay/mixing...  we  don't  want  to  run
                        through  a  silent  maze, right? - hance  a  2-4 channel
                        mixer will have yet to be added, as  well. On the humble
                        ST I need  to emulate a  DA directly writing into the YM
                        via timer a, on the STE+ i will the DMA sound system, of
                        course.

                        menus, a level  loader (I hope to recieve the level data
                        from the  Apple IIgs guys, soon :), will  be one  of the
                        last steps in finishing the game.

ÒWhere are the enemies?! Originally the screen has about 3o colours...


But I think even if "Wolfenstein" will be  finished somewhen, the running engine
could be help to port more  games of this kind  to the ST, I don't think on DOOM
and such  stuff, but there are enough ego shooters around that  aren't on a much
higher technical level than "Wolfenstein" but still a good play.
Naaaah.... This game itself would be cool enough at first (...) :)
