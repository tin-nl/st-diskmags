                               HELP NEEDED!
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As always we need some more help to make the next  issue of UCM a better read...

+ Articles! The essence  of a diskmag! As you can  see in the  menu there aren't
  that much contributors  and so we're  still searching people to join the staff
  of writers. You  mustn't be a steady  writer, and even  one single article can
  help to brighten up the whole scenery. The only thing you have to do is to sat
  down and torment your keyboard. All themes and ideas allowed, there will be no
  censoring except for rassistic/fascistic items or the use to of UCM to fuck of
  people you personally dislike...

+ Art! We always need help  on the pixels side. If you want to take over the job
  to paint a  loader or menu  grafix or even  if you want  to support with other
  pixels stuff that can be used in the magazine, don't hesitate to contact us!

+ Musix! As always we will bring UCM  with background music, namely 3 chip musix
  and one  tracker module. Please note that this should be in ordinary 4 channel
  format and please avoid playing around  with specials there. The current probs
  with the module are nerve  consuming and  could delay the  whole thing! And it
  would be cool if the  module wont  break any limits in  packed size, 1oo up to
  15o kb should  be the absolute  max as I don't  want to release  more splitted
  issues...
  So if  you have composed  something you  want to make  accessable for a bigger
  community, UCM could be the base for you...

+ Intros, goodies... all things are welcome! Please get in touch before!

All support has to be sent to
