Since the  release of ò"COFFEINE OVERDOSE"ð the  name óREMOð  is in  all  mouths and
since he  joined ó.tSCc.ð the  hype is  perfected. And  as all  people are looking
forward to  new stuff from  óREMOð under the  ó.tSCc.ð label, I thought "Let's check
out his roots  and look what he has done before his big success last year!" Said
and done...

And óREMOð was active before, surely  his first production, this little intro with
the title ò"Vertigo"ð wasn't  spreaded that much (or not at all), but this doesn't
holds me back  to check it out now. So let us reveal the roots of our coder REMO
in all its ñbrutality...

After loading the little demo file a short warning message appears, that this is
part one  and done  in GFA basic  and anyone who hates that stuff should go away
now. Me not and so I get the first effect after the screen turns into dark blue.

A starfield, or, not  a real starfield, more a starspreader, wow... that reminds
me to some  ñST stuffð. But I  miss something, music... and  óREMOð pointed out that
this  demo/intro doesn't  contains any  music, don't ask me  why since there are
enough routines around to build in MOD files even into GFA demos.

Some short  infos  coming up  in plain  white letters  on the  screen, the stars
disappearing  and making  place for  a ñcolourful  but very low quality ò"Vertigo"
logo that starts  to zoom away slowly and finally was set on fire and burns away
completely. The  zoomer is ñawfully slowð but the fire effect is quite ok, even if
it is an oldie on the Falcon already, even with GFA Basic...

The show  goes on with  RGB vector balls, flying around on the screen, 3 of them
at all with  a mediocre size  but right then a message is displayed, saying that
this is a  Falcon and you  know what comes next, the same effect using raytraced
balls  that ñlooking  much better  nowð but were  seen already in the ò"Warum"ð demo
from 1993...

But it  seems as  óREMOð didn't  took care about  that and  goes on  with  his old
fashioned show, bringing a ñvery slow plasmað colour by colour onto the screen.
This one  seems to  be stretched  here and  there a  bit but as said, it is damn
slow. After a while it disappears and óREMOð wants to warp now...

Warp? Normally  this sentence appears at the end of a scroller or when a demo is
going to loop... but  óREMOð enters  some warp  sequence, using a plasma tunnel in
ñquite ugly  coloursð, yellow/blue/pink that goes faster and faster and finally to
brake slowly after a while.

The last demo effect comes up now, showing us a raytraced picture of the dome or
something of a church/cathedral and a glass ball is rolling around on it, also a
very old  effect but nice  done in the  end and in my eyes ñmaybe the best effect
óREMOð brought us in his debut production. ñWell done...

Finally we reached the  end, featuring a few greetings in white letters on black
background  in high  resolution and  óREMOð is going  to greet a lot of women... I
hope he recognized in the end that girls aren't impressable by computer demos :)

Then the demo ends with a simple "The End" logo and... surprise, it locks up the
machine.

ñFinal words... "Vertigo" isn't a  burner, no, it even isn't a  stunning intro or
ñ               something. The lack of any music  leaves a bitter taste  since so
ñ               the presented bunch of  oldschool Falcon effects  loosing more of
ñ               their possibilities  to impress  the watching person. REMO brings
ñ               just a bunch  of old school effects, smashed  together in a hurry
ñ               and without  bigger tries  to create  a throughgoing design. Only
ñ               lightpoint is the old fashioned glassball at the end of the demo.
ñ               The other stuff just makes you yawning...

ñWithout any doubt, a simple mod  file for the musical  score would have made the
ñoverall impression much better, but as this demo shows, the most people starting
ñwith small  things, it's  still shit... but  after  all REMO did a good  move in
ñmaking it public after his  successfull ò"COFFEINE OVERDOSE"ñ... since now anybody
ñknows that he's able to do more and better stuff...
