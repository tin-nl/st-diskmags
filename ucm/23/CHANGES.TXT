              CHANGES - THINGS THAT ENDED UP IN ANOTHER WAY AS THOUGHT
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me use this to explain some changes in this magazine...

At first, a big sorry to  Frequent/Ephidrena  since I wasn't able to use his mod
he supplied me long time ago. So far  we don't know why  the mag internal replay
rout bugs with  the module he gave me while the ordinary Falcon Protracker plays
it well. I hope we  can fix it  for the  forthcoming issues.  Mr Pink started to
patch something  in the magazine but from this point here I can't say if it runs
and  since I'm working since  1o hours today  to finish that  damn magazine I've
lost all mood for experiments. So his really nice module will be included in one
of the forthcoming issues  if we match  it in some way to kick out the bugs that
avoid a properly replay.

At second, this issue is the first UCM that comes along in splitted versions.
One full issue, running on any machine, esp. tought for Falcon since it contains
the  Falcon sound file in  the DATA file, but only  on machines  that supporting
HD drives  or harddisx since  it wasn't possible to fit  ALL stuff together onto
one disk.... So the ST users that are running the mag from disk have to take the
LITE version  only as it fits  with big problems  onto a disk and so can be read
there too. But this file don't contains the original soundtrack! So take care!

Thanx for reading and I hope you understand my moves!
