                              - we are waking up! -

          Silly Venture 2k - chance for the polish scene resurrection?

 Do you remember these days when polish scene became famous by releasing bunch
 of new Falcon releases? What  happend  to  all these folx, do they still care
 about Atari scene? Well, cheer up, I have some good news for you.. :)) If all
 goes to plan  SV2k  should bring some "fresh air" from polish atari scene. :)
 But hey, did you ever think what could be a reason of that "release-silence"?
 Let me explain then... It was nothing else than partyless.. Yup.. After QuaST
 disappearing polish releases shrinked almost to zero. :(( QuaST party was the
 tradition, it became  the legend of  polish  Atari scene  and suddenly.. just
 disappeard for good.. I decided on the brave step and give a helpful hand for
 the polish scene by organizing  Silly Venture. Yup,  I don't want to hide the
 fact that  SV2k  is my own _try_ to change the situation of polish  ST/Falcon
 scene. Believe me, there is still _a lot_ of potential in polish atari scene.
 Polish ST/Falcon scene was so happy to hear about this convention and already
 promised to make another releases especially  for  SV2k.  That's exactly what
 I was counting for! Cobra is going to release another multi-part demo for the
 Falcon and finish their "Awaken" demo for  ST. Of course it's still uncertain
 if they manage it - but there ARE the chances for that (read below!).

 In that case  SV2k public  should be  a witness  of the  little polish  scene
 resurrection. The chances for that are  quite big because some people seem to
 be motivated as never before! Just take a look below..

 Winio doesn't has his  Falcon  at home atm (there is a deal between Winio and
 his girlfriend which nobody knows!  If Winio has to stop drinking  to get his
 Falcon back - don't count on it!) so it's still uncertain if their new falcon
 demo see the light of the day at SV2k. Winio says it's possible because there
 is still a lot of time left (huh?). Time will show..

 Winio promised to make a call to  Mayonez (their ST coder) to finish "Awaken"
 especially for SV2k (first preview was shown at EIL'99).

 Let's cross the fingers!

                             another SV2k invitro?!

 Guess wot..? That's what I call a real surprise! Independent Falcon coder has
 been working on the SV2k invitro!  Monsoft  didn't know that MSB members were
 already working on it... When MSB released invitros  Monsoft  decided to stop
 his work.. Sadness, because it would be cool to see it anyway!

 Monsoft do his best  to support  SV2k  and he spreads all invitros on his own
 www-site!

 thanx monsoft! cu at sv2k!

                          is back to kick some butts!

 All MSB fellaz are  busy working  on the  new falcdemo! "Upside Down" will be
 surely released at the forthcoming SV2k! Sqward spends every minute on fixing
 details, be ready for a nice release :)) Unfortunately there is no chance for
 new ST demo from us at SV2k, however we should release small ST release short
 after the party.

 Master of black ceremonies is back on track!  Darth,  founder  and main coder
 from this crew  FINALLY  got his Falcon back! He gave his  machine  to repair
 in February last year and got it back in March THIS yeart! 13 bloody months..
 geesus! The man who took  Darth's  machine  just  moved to the  new flat  and
 changed the phone-number without telling him about that! Darth wasn't able to
 find him! Hopefuly he got in touch with  his brother  and  finally  this crap
 story reached the end...

 But even in time when Darth was losing  the faith in getting his machine back
 he wasn't going to give up and promised to release  new PNM demo even without
 his own machine! :)) (he asked  me to  borrow  the Falcon,  hopefuly it isn't
 needed anymore!). Darth is motivated as never before!

 They are currently working on the  new falcdemo  called  "Sacrifice". As guys
 from PNM say - "it will be surely released at SV2k!". Kewl!

                           Yoyo went to Underground..?

 Strange things happen here. It's like the part of scenario taken from X-files
 series! Yoyo just.. disappeard! He doesn't reply on any mails, Klocek (Syntax
 GFX artist)  was  trying  to  get in touch  with  him via phone, visiting him
 personally and.. no success! sh*t! :(( Dunno wassup with him..

 Anyway Klocek wish to finish his new disk-magazine under "Underground" label.
 Currently he has  some troubles  with  his  Mega STe, so the  date-release is
 uknown atm..

 Echo Core Union probably works on the special issue of "Echo" disk-maggie for
 SV2k. It's quite a nice surprise because since last year or so their magazine
 was available only as HTML version! (www.promail.pl/~echosite)

 There is a little chance that No Future (ex Excellent Team) will finish their
 long awaited msx-colly for the Falcon at  SV2k.  As Bloomer (coder) says - in
 fact it's released since 2 years,  however the lack of good *.XM player stops
 me from doing anything more on it.. They search for solution..
