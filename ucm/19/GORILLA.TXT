Big Hello to all Atarians. My name is Gorila from Argentina. I would like to 
tell you about the Latin-america Atari Scene. Five years ago, there was a really 
important Atari Scene, located in Argentina. The Main Software/Demos distributor 
was a store in Buenos Aires called Compuworld. The scene was integrated by 60-70 
Atari Fanatics using ST and Mega ST machines. Most of them had 1000-1500 Atari 
Disks with plenty of demos, intros, etc.

In 1994, most of the software came from Chile , from a store called Software 
Jack. They were mostly cracked versions from different crews (Pompey , D-Bug, 
etc.). Also, Uruguay (another country near Argentina) had a small Atari Scene , 
which was rulez by Max. (A Cracker Man from Uruguay). In 1995, Compuworld stop 
to innovate in the software market, and most atarians could not buy/trade 
software anymore. Magazines and official Atari products from Europe were very 
expensive and almost impossible to find. So, the scene start to decay until 
Internet appears. (Telephone costs very extremely expensive) Nowadays, I am 
trying to communicate with all the South American Atari Scene to join a major 
Atari Scene Group. All people from Mexico, Chile , Uruguay, Argentina Peru are 
welcome. Please, get in touch with me!!

The central idea of the Web Site is supporting those people that need New/Fresh 
Atari Software all around the World. The Site has receive visits from Atarians

Finally, I would like to appreciate Elite and Vectronix effort on countribution 
with new warez to the Scene. So, Stay Atari and Never give up.
