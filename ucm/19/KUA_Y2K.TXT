
{*f1 YEAR 2K BY KUA{*f0

  Things decided that I would review their intro to Maggie 28 before their first 
  steps, shall I repeat then that KUA is a band from remote Greece and that this 
  is a one-man crew with GGN as coder ? I will assume not :)
  
  As said above GGN made his first steps with this 8 Kb screen planned to be 
  presented at DHS Xmas Online Compo but seemingly delayed and thus labelled a 
  Year 2K effort. This screen doesn't feature any music to start with and that's 
  too bad... Hum I've just loaded an Excellence In Art tune called DEVOTION to 
  ease my pain when typing this ò(thanks SND 1.3 !).
  
  As a start we are shown a circled motive made up of mixed ASCII letters. On 
  top of it we can try and see a text reading GGN of KUA. The scrolltext in the 
  lower part of the screen reads "press Alt + Help to read this". I tried and 
  the screen stopped with no other choice than rebooting... Not funny... Then 
  the circle reduces and then you can read the text (so no need for that stupid 
  key game !). The second and last part features a black background with snow 
  flakes falling from above as they logically do. Maybe I forgot to add that 
  these flakes are Atari logos ;) You wait a while until the screen goes white 
  with this virtual snow... You read the scrollext but then nothing... Just 
  press space and return to GEM.
  
  Well this is a first step attempt and the most interesting of this screen is 
  to show that there are still newcomers !!! I didn't suspect Greece to hide 
  Atarian resistants but I can only rejoiyce of the finding ! I hope to see more 
  from GGN in a near future now !!
