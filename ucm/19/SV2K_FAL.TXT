  ò              ----------- FALCON INVITATION - TRO -----------
              

 I have just finished reviewing the ST invitro that I have to rewrite it for the 
 Falcon section now :) Well not really as you're are going to read. Btw I really 
 don't have the time to get a vga connected to my Falcon to make sure the intro 
 also supports VGA but I think it does....
 
 As said in my review of the ST invitro, the objective of this intro lies in 
 giving you enough info about the Sillyventure 2000 party to convince you to 
 move your ass and come over :) Unlike the St version, this one doesn't feature 
 a music selector or real graphics but the design is really neat !! I even 
 remember Earx - almost in tears :) - telling me he had never seen such a nice 
 shell before ! And to be honest he's damm right !
 
 Once loaded, the main screen appears while a great module by óSeaBrushð is heard. 
 The shell is very colorful and stylish : on the left side a vertical bar made 
 up of different sections can help you jump to a precise page such as "history, 
 compos, headquarters, greetz, expected guests" and so on. The main frame is of 
 course filled with text... The background used is a colorful texture, the color 
 font is soft and pleasant and you can find loads of photos of real nice quality 
 (except for the photo of me :)) included.
 
ñ Okay I was a bit disappointed not to have any brainblasting effect to admire 
ñ but this shell is perfect : nice colors, great music, neat design, smooth 
ñ scroller even when the window's filled with photos... Now I'm just wondering if 
ñ Mystic Bytes plans to use it again, say to create their own diskmag :))
