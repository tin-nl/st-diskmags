    Another music compilation this time from POV. As you can guess from its name 
this one is dedicated to óJESTER / Sanityð a very famous track musician. It won't 
take me long to describe this compil as there isn't too much to say.

    When it comes to graphics you can only enjoy a few rendered gfx yet of good 
quality as a presentation. Then you are presented with a very poor screen that 
reads "F1..." with the names of the tunes and the key you'll have to press to 
load it. There is also a credits screen that gives you the very basic info you 
want to know.

    When listening to the music you may feel bored... òA LOT.ð There is no 
animation at all, no pattern progress shown, absolutely nothing ! You don't even 
know what track you are listening to and that definitely sucks ! I could just 
use any soundtracker and I would even have more options like setting trebble and 
bass, swapping voices, whatever... But here there is nothing you can do but 
press a stupid function key to change tune.

    Erm the tunes : actually it all depends on your taste. I remember enjoying 
Jester's tunes when Iwas younger but now I'm just quite not sure. They really 
sound old school and some instruments sound like bugs sometimes .... ?? ..... Ok 
now if you are a Jester fan you can find some tunes here and there and use your 
favourite tracker for more comfort. Here is nothing worth... Did I mention the 
demo only featured 6 modules ? Modulation 2 (on ST!) features a dozen plus nice 
animations.... I'd rather reboot my St and enjoy óModulation 2ð instead
