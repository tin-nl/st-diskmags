ñMahabharatað by òFit and Friendsð (óFalconð) [2000]
 

A tight and very communicative scene like the Atari scene has one major 
disadvantage: There are hardly any surprises.
Most demos that are being released have been announced, advertised and maybe 
even previewed long before the actual release. And even if not, news and 
informations in diskmags such as ñMaggieð or ñUCMð tend to give at least a 
hint about who does what currently.
As nice as this is, it rubs out one fun-factor totally: Surprise.
The thrill of unpacking an unseen, unexpected, unawaited and totally new 
demo nobody has ever heard about before - and if it's from an exoctic and
unknown group, it's even better.

òFITð, a new finnish crew, has managed to get exactly that surprise bonus 
for themselves. They strike on January the 3rd and release ñMahabharatað,
an all new demo for the óFalconð, RGB and VGA.

As the same suggests, ñMahabharatað features a very unique and original, so 
far unseen style: ñClassical indian/hindu styleð.
The demo starts with a male voice chanting which initiates the soundtrack of 
the demo. A picture with the name of the demo next to a ñgolden statueð of a 
pseudo-humanized elephant.
The screen dissappears to make room for the first effect.
In front of a ñblue backgroundð a glowing star-like thing is being shown 
which illuminates a part of the background in rays as well. These rays seem 
to rotate in different speeds, overlaying and interfering this way.
Three ancient indian looking letters appear on screen while the "flare" 
keeps rotating and the background is changed into a nice orange.
The screen makes room for a new effect. This time it's a golden statue of a 
ñhumanoidð with 4 arms, who has sat down to pray obviously with two of his
four hands raised holding some presumably holy objects and his other two 
hands resting in his lap. The ñlightflaresð from before reappear behind 
his hands and his head, growing and shrinking in size periodically as if the 
praying man emitted a kind of glowing aura.
The next effect recycles the good old zoomer: You see a not very good 
looking monochrome picture of a -presumably- indian female face along with 
the torso in a circle. This picture zooms away and the screen fills with 
lots of copies of that picture that just differ in the background colour. 
After a while of zooming away it gets obvious that these monochrome pictures 
were only the elements of a much larger, coloured picture of a face of an 
indian girl. The screen zooms in again and you are getting the monochrome 
drawing again.
Through all this, an indian letter blinks in the upper right corner of the 
screen.
Time for the ñfunny lightflareð from before again. And why not. This time
with other indian letters and other colours in the background.
Fade down to make room for a ñnice graphicð of a mystic, colourful dragon-
like face in a consortium of unknown letters and other ornaments around it.
The picture is being built and faded again in a very funky way.
Repitition teaches the donkey, so let's do such a ñzoomerð again. This time 
you see the monochrome face of an old indian man with a beard, which is 
being zoomed away to display that it's only an element of a picture of a 
much larger face with his left arm raised - can't see if it's someone famous 
though.
Every demo ends with the ñcreditsð. The credits here consist of a picture in 
highres which mentions the names of the authors, which were òMarqð of óFitð, 
òSturmð and òAcornð for the code, òZebrað of óFitð for the graphics and 
òRozð of óFitð for the music.
It should be mentioned as well that the demo runs nicely with accelerators 
without screwing up the demo-part switching or the effects, runs fine on 
òRGBð as well as òVGAð and doesn't even bother about a lot of accessories 
loaded - according to òEvilð, it even runs cleanly under ñMiNTð.

This demo has taken us in surprise, however, it doesn't feature anything 
surprising except for the style of the demo.
The code is clean and flawless, the guys who coded this demo are definetly 
no newbies, neither on the òAtarið nor in general. The effects being 
presented are being presented in a stylish way, keeping up the ñancientð 
ñindianð style of the demo all the time. The in-between graphics are mainly 
scanned i presume, but look nice and fit into the demo perfectly. Same goes 
for the sound which is a nice mixture of a male and a female voice chanting 
along with a very original bassline and theme.
Even though the demo basically features only two effects, the ñlightflareð 
thing and the ñone-in-many zoomerð, it is definetly entertaining and i hope 
to see more from these folks in the future.
