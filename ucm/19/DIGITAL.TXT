   Here is the Sinner's contribution to the Xmas intro tradition. Reading the 
textfile I couldn't really understand why this intro wasn't presented at the DHS 
Xmas Online Compo but it doesn't matter much. The Sinner is a newcomer on the 
Scene, a brave GFA coder and this is his part...

  First bad thing about the intro is the resolution managment. I ran it in mid- 
res as I mainly use this resolution, but the result was really bad so I had to 
reboot my HD (it seems you cannot escape the intro :(. Then I realized my first 
opinion wasn't that biased : the screen reading "Avendesora proudly presents" 
that comes with a poor santa claus picture is lame :( As usual the problem is 
mainly raised from the band being a one-man crew but really the picture is 
horrible. At least the old-school-like chip isn't too bad. 

 Then, that's it ! Well almost... a poor textwindow with low resolution text 
that uses the system font is displayed with 6 sections, among them "best movie 
best artist, best crew, best demo, bla bla". Then you have no other choice than 
press space and wait. Great... the screen flashes from black to white, a white 
curtain rises up and you are offered the Sinner's charts. No need to say that 
this is damm boring to read about what you don't give a dammm... Wrap !!
 
 No chance. Some greetings are sent with lame white text and a small distortion 
effect. The last screen presenting a flickering though still plasma with some 
credits is maybe the best thing to be seen here.
 
 A newcomer : no surprise, no style but that's how we all started. Ok this 
screen isn't worth downloading but at least it is here and we long to see more 
and know if The Sinner can do better ! Up to you now...
