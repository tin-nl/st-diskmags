 CDLab 0.31 is available. It fixes a major bug in version 0.30. Go and check it 
out in the download section of my homepage at Ûhttp://cdlab.atari.org  

ÛHere are the current characteristics of CDLab : 

     DAO (Disc-at-once) copy for any single-session discs ; 
     CD-RW blanking function ; 
     Supports the following drives : 
     
        * Philips CDD2000/CDD2600 and compatible models (such as the Mitsumi, HP 
          or Kodak ones), Teac CD-R50S/CD-R55S and JVC/Traxdata compatible 
          models,  
        * Any writer which supports the SCSI-3 multimedia commands 
        * Copies either directly from an ordinary CD-Rom drive, or via your hard 
          disk 
        * SCSIDRV-protocol compatible (supported by CBHD and HDDriver - also 
          used by the SPIN! CD-ROM driver -, allowing CDLab to work on all 
          available Atari-compatible platforms)   
        * Full GEM advanced ergonomy using the WinDom GEM library.

     writing support.
