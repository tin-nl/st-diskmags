    òPyjamað is a new French crew, so far composed of Exocet as gfman and gfa 
coder. Maybe you remember Exocet as the brilliant gfxman of óPOSITIVITYð and 
surely you know him from the 3Kb compo in which he ranked first !

    This time Exocet, under the crew name of PYJAMA, brings us a small but nice 
gfa intro called Kitty Cat. It starts  with a  nice tune  by ISO of Sentry. the 
window is filled with a  nice violet color purple stars and an animated cartoon 
cat soon appears on the left side of the screen while some text is displayed on 
the right side. 

     Next screen shows  another nice  picture, this time a bottle  of beer with 
some cat motives on it. Greetings are displayed on the left side using the same 
stylish white font seen before. Erm nothing more then :)

     Ok this is a very small intro but to speak the truth I enjoyed watching it 
a lot despite the absence  of real effects... The colors, pictures and tune are 
really nice and I'm sure you can have a good time  watching this ! Last but not 
least this intro shows  Exocet's will  to go on with his ST activities and I am 
sincerely waiting for more stuff now !
