              (So what's the big deal about Mint anyway?) 

ñA  CiH  writes,  to get the discussion guns blazing fiercely!  Read the 
following, then have your say in the next UCM!ð

Mint  has  always  had an image of being  slightly  non-mainstream,  as 
operating  systems  go.  Fiercely anti-commercial,  disparaging even of 
their  nearest Atari-based rivals,  Mint is the guerilla fighter of the 
O/S world.  Mint devotees tend to keep to this offhand image,  doggedly 
loyal  to  their  chosen vocation on the one hand,  but not  caring  to 
reveal too much to outsiders on the other.

This  is  going  to have to change,  however,  as Mint is going  to  be 
getting  a much greater exposure,  emerging blinking in harsh sunlight, 
from the jungle,  like the guerilla fighter of our earlier metaphor, to 
be told, perhaps, the war is finally over?

We were anticipating the worlds first computer with Mint as the primary 
O/S,  with the announcement of the Phenix 260T.  Now it looks like that 
arrival  of this landmark machine is very uncertain.  The payoff is yet 
to come, in the fact that Mint may well be one of the options available 
on the awesomely powerful RioRed, (or 'son of Phenix'!)

Clearly,  Mint  devotees  should  be out there,  winning  friends,  and 
influencing  as many people as possible,  in anticipation of this happy 
event. Is the evidence there to suggest they are doing that?

The  problem  is,  that unless you are already among the ranks  of  the 
faithful,  there  seems  to be little to appeal to the casual user,  or 
first timer wishing to experiment a little.

The whole presentation/information side of Mint could really do with an 
overhaul.  Website  information is well-presented by its devotees,  but 
these  always concentrate on the site authors own efforts,  with little 
effort  to link it to the work of others.  

It  really  could  do  with a  direct  equivalent  to  Bengy  Collins's 
excellent 'MagiC News' site, which manages to nicely centralise all the 
diverse  areas  of  interest,  and also provides a huge eyeful  of  the 
possibilities  of that particular O/S.  Whilst we are on the subject of 
making  news coverage more systematic,  a Mint web-ring might be a good 
idea as well?

It  depends who has got the time really,  as the most high-profile Mint 
people,  seem  to  be fantastically busy people in all sorts  of  other 
areas (Hi Evil!)

Maybe the problem is in the attitude of the Mint community itself?  The 
impression  I get,  rightly or wrongly,  is of a technically biased and 
somewhat introverted set of users, maybe willing to help if you do ask, 
but not going out of their way, to showcase their greatest achievements 
or make themselves more accessible to the jargon-impaired public?

And  what  are those greatest achievements of Mint anyway?  One of  the 
purposes of Mint,  as I understand it,  is to make UNIX software easier 
to  port  over to Atari platforms.  Katherine Ellis,  in supporting the 
homebrew  programmers point of view describes Mint as a tool,  which if 
you  know  how  to  use properly,  you can build a house  to  your  own 
specifications  with,   rather  than  relying  on  the  'prefabricated' 
solutions of the commercial providers.

This  sounds good in theory,  until you realise you are scratching your 
head  looking  around  vainly for that elusive 'Killer App',  that runs 
exclusively  on  Mint,  and  that you would rush to bin  your  existing 
MagiC-based  O/S  solution for.  All we ever find are Mint  programmers 
using Katherine's pen-knife,  not to build a dream house, but merely to 
make a slightly bigger knife with!

The  solution  here,  may be a comprehensive softography of those  real 
world  applications  that are Mint-only,  to make the  sceptical  users 
mouth water in anticipation!  All that is visible, at the moment, are a 
host of obscure tune-ups for the O/S itself,  meaning little or nothing 
to the uninitiated?

The  other  major problem for Mint,  relates to the allegedly  fearsome 
learning curve, and Byzantine installation procedure, the trade-off for 
the  fact that it is a free O/S.  Here at last,  there may be the first 
signs  of daylight,  with 'Newbie Mint',  the first simple installation 
for first timers located on the following URL.

Well at least you can get it, once they sort out the download ;-)
                                  
Hopes are high that this may provide a decent way to getting into Mint, 
without needing to take extra strength painkillers on a regular basis!

With  this new blood soon to be coming in,  maybe the time is ripe  for 
some fresh ideas?


ñFinal thoughts..ð

An article like this invites a response, or even lots of responses from 
the Mint community. We hope we get them!

The  purpose of this article is hopefully to get Mint,  and its largely 
hidden from general view benefits,  out into the mainstream. With MagiC 
seeming  to make all the running at the moment,  as the main O/S on the 
new Milan 2, a timely exposure of the alternative cannot do any harm at 
all.

I hope I've not come across as derogatory to Mint fans, but my concerns 
may well be a reflection of what a lot of other people may be  thinking 
at  this  time?  I am a reasonably contented MagiC user,  when I need a 
multi-tasking  O/S,  but I am curious about the alternative,  and would 
like the Mint community to come out of their shell a little.  What have 
you  got,  apart from defiance of an arbitrary Atari 'mainstream'  that 
no-one else has?

Personally, I'm more open-minded about this, since the time when I last 
tried  something  called 'Multi-TOS',  and damaged the paintwork in  my 
hallway with the speed of taking it off my Falcon.  At that time,  pre-
internet and restricted memory, there seemed to be very little point to 
a multi-tasking O/S.  Now, with more golden years of experience, fatter 
RAM  amounts,  and the odd accelerator card and spare Falcon with  room 
for experimentation here and there, the time may be right for people to 
give Mint another taste?
