ñ             3k graphics competition.

             The 3k graphics competition was a big success. We got a record in number of
             contributions, as well as a record in number of votes! 
             The aim in the competition was, that by any means - except ripping, create the best
             picture in 3 kilobytes. Any number of colours, any method, any resolution allowed. The
             result had to be delivered in Jpeg, Gif, Png or Pc1 format.

                  Results are as following:
