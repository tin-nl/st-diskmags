                òMaggie 10th Birthday Issue Briefing!ð

Ah here it is, the begging letter!

Now you  all know,  I'm sure,  that the next Maggie,  is a very special 
issue  for us,  that it is our 10th anniversary issue,  and quite apart 
from all the stuff the regular Maggie Team are doing for it, we want as 
many people as possible to join in the fun! 

If you want to help out, you can do so, in a number of different ways.

 ñNew Shell?ð 
A long overdue refurbishment should be coming our way, assuming that Mr 
Pinks employers allow him some time away from his job? 

We  need feedback for ideas,what you might like to see in a new  Maggie 
Shell.  Also,  some  idea  of what kind of systems people have got  out 
there  wouldn't  go amiss,  as we've got anecdotal evidence for  people 
wanting to read Maggie on anything from a Hades,  to those folk who are 
looking for the same classic diskmag they found in 1990, as that is all 
they  are able to run on Pacifist?  At the very least,  support for the 
dominant  next-gen Atari compatible is on the cards.  (At this point in 
time,  most  likely to be Milan.) Mr Pink has several ideas of his own, 
these will have to remain classified for now though!

 ñArticlesð 
Up to you,  there isn't a huge rush, but even giving six months warning 
never  seems to be enough time for some people!  Even a short piece  on 
what  the  last  10  years of Maggie meant to you  will  do,  as  I  am 
intending  on  putting  these all together in one  large  textfile.  Of 
course,  if anyone has ideas for anything more substantial (grin!) then 
get in touch! 

Another idea I've had,  where outside help is going to be essential, to 
make  it  work,  is  a 'Where are they now' piece for  old-time  Maggie 
people.  I  want  anyone who used to be connected to Maggie to  get  in 
touch and tell us what is presently going on in their lives,  no matter 
how small or eccentric they feel their past contributions to Maggie may 
have been. 

 ñIntro!!ð 
Anyone  feel  up to doing an intro?  Must be 10th  anniversary  themed, 
otherwise  whatever  you like.  The 'deadline' is August,  as stated in 
Maggie 28.

Anything else at all that you think might help?  Needless to say,  work 
has started on this special issue,  plans are being made,  and articles 
are now being written.
