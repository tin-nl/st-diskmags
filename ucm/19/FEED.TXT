        I don't know what to say this time, because everything I said about the 
previous UCM can be repeated once again ... Maybe this time I could complain 
that there was no intro ...what a shame ... We can understand that, maybe people 
are kept busy with the DHS online compo, but, it'd be great to see the best 
intro of the compo in the UCM 18, that'd be fun :-) Maybe next time :-) 

	The musics are excellent, always flooded with the spirit of their 
composers :-) and I don't want to talk ages about the poor gfx shell, it's no 
good speaking about what oneself did... Btw Vulgar did a very good Xmas cover 
picture :-) 

	More people wrote for UCM 18, 12 persons exactly, while 10 contributed 
to UCM 17, hehe nice :-) But all of that is comparison ...

I hope UCM could even be better than what it is now :-)

ÒSTS words : now that I have a few UCM issues behind me, I can clearly see and 
Òapprehend the changes that have occured over the last months : okey UCM is 
Òthinner but remember this is mainly due to the number of releases. Above all I 
Òwant UCM to be released on - almost - a regular basis so that everyone is 
Òexpecting it regardless the events or releases because the main purpose of UCM 
Òis to maintain that information web between all Atarians. Also I'm very happy to 
Òsee that we have new writers every now and then, fresh blood is cool and it 
Òbrings more variety and spice to each new issue ! Let's go on this way !

 Hi,

after seeing your request on the DHS board, I thought i'd add to the mag and put
some feedback together for issue 19.
Overall I enjoyed the mag as always, though the number of articles seemed down
on previous issues - but then thats up to the contributors I guess, unless we
want 'maggie-esque' delays for future issues while StS waits for more text :)
Reviews are always fun to read, especially of your own releases, so having read
Paranoids review of our 'crimbo' intro, I thought i'd do a mini-reply to some of
the questions he put to the readers:

first off: 'crimbo' is just another word for Christmas, well in england anyway
:)
yes, it does use the top left border, as always we didn't have access to a
falcon to test if it would work, but going on our previous releases, we didn't
hold out much hope :(
the packer: this was entirely my (spiny) fault, i'd read the deadline for the
competition wrong, and when I checked the DHS site to see if the compo was still
on, I was a bit shocked to find it had closed, so all I could do was grab the
nearest packer I could (JAM packer), squish the .prg and beg Evil to let it be
included. As it turns out JAM does not work on the Falcon - ouch. *update* i've
put an atomic-packed version on our web page if anyone missed it first time
round.
lastly: no, it doesn't crash after the screen fills with snow  - we tested it :)

other stuff:

Would it be possible to have a 'mini-shell' to use with the article construction
kit, so someone creating an article would be able to see how the end product
looks before submitting it. something simple would do.

Lastly, the FLA article was pretty good too, don't be put off by negative
comments, everyone started somewhere, if people took serious notice of the
charts and reviews, they'd give up before they released a second screen.

well, thats all,
cheers from Spiny - gfx bloke in the 'supergroup (c) maggie 28' torment :)

ÒSTS words : thanks for giving us additional information about Crimbo (I was also 
Òamazed at that name but not smart enough to ask the question :) About the UCM 
Òshell : the shell needs a number of files to work, like the menutext and 
Òpicture, a start picture, 3 chippies and one module (on Falcon) thus if I give 
Òaway such a test shell, I need to include all these files otherwise you won't be 
Òable to watch any result. I'll be thinking of it and surely release a mini shell 
Òafter I'm done with this issue. Of course all piccies and chippies will be 
Ò"already used" material to avoid any ripping but that sounds like a good idea 
Òesp if it motivates some of you to add piccies, colors or headlines to their 
Òarticle :))

Hi pals ! Nice Ucm 18 ! I would like to congratulate St Survivor and the usual 
writers in the most famous magascene over the Atari world for being so motivated 
after all this time ! What fanatics they are ! I admire you dudes !  
 
Keep up the good work my friends ! Only bad thing : I really don't like shell 
graphics : arrows are inverted !!! What happened ?

(not very motivated but anyway, I will be on da place if someone needs me)

Ò-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ÒSTS words : thank you Philippe. I hope to see more new writers come and 
Òstrengthen up the UCM team soon ! About the arrows thing : erm you are right, 
ÒCosmosH mixed up the up and down arrows and as I never use them to browse 
Òthrough the mag but rather use the arrow keys, I didn't even notice it ! Sorry 
ÒI should be more careful next time :(

 In general good but too short. Halve the releases and double the content.
 Vote sheet ? you should register ucm.atari.org
 
 greets PeyloW
 
Ò-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ÒSTS words : well I think you have perfectly pointed out at the current situation 
Òof UCM. Should I wait for more contributions BUT release UCM every four or five 
Òmonths ? Or release it regularly though smaller than it used to be ? As the main 
Òeditor I had to make a decision and after long thinking I have decided that 
Òbeing called the Magascene, UCM should rather be published every month or so 
Ò(delays are not volontarily taken into account :( so that we could show every 
ÒAtarian around that we - sceners - are still alive ! Maybe it'll convince people 
Òto come and join us, maybe not... Ok the current reviews are not as numerous as 
Òwhen Moondog was in charge but I don't want to write all the articles (as he 
Òused to write most of them) because I don't want it to become STS mag. I prefer 
Òto have a mixed issue with lots of writers and as many points of views instead. 
ÒAs said before this is a choice and not an easy one. Also I cannot say how many 
Òdemos will be released (this early new year has been very quiet so far) or how 
Òmany writers will help me. If you compare issue 15 to the lastest ones, you'll 
Òsee many different writers, sometimes they only write once but at least this 
Òmakes of UCM a "multiracial" magazine. Thus it remains open to all who want to 
Òsay something. Having no regular team (though paranoid is a most reliable pal) 
Òis a problem to me...

ÒAbout the votesheet : its absence for two issues or so makes sense in my 
Òopinion because there hasn't been enough releases to vote for. What's the point 
Òvoting for old sceners ? Ok we owe them much but WE are keeping the Atari alive
Ònow ! I don't want to vote for them or vote for a demo released a year ago. But 
ÒI think and hope that Sillyventure 2000 will bring enough releases to change 
Òthings Maybe it'll show new or confirmed talents ??? I hope so anyway so you 
Òcan expect a charts section in UCM20. I'll spread the votesheet later as I want 
Òto exclude some useless vote categories before...
 
ÒAbout being hosted at Atari.org. Well I'm currently working on it. But I don't 
Òthink I can build an entire homepage with UCM. Also you seem to ignore that 
Òsince last January I have opened and managed a ÚUCM Archives PageÒ within my own 
Òhomepage : it features the whole UCM collection to be downloaded (20 issues and 
Òsoon 21), the ÛArticle Construction KitÒ that teaches how how to create a nice 
Òlooking article with colors, headlines and pictures. Last but not least this 
Òpage also includes a ÚguestbookÒ for you to write nice or bad comments on UCM. 
ÒOki now for the url : Ûhttp://perso.libertysurf.fr/stsurvivorÒ. Check it out now.
