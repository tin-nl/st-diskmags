ñLemonð by òMind Designð of The Lunatic Asylum (óFalconð) [2000]


Another surprise. All of a sudden, the two swedes with style are back to do
tricks on their and my favourite computer: òThe Vikingð and òDeezð are back
and bring you the first demo which features two executables, one for
accelerated Falcons - especially óct2ð - and one for standard Falcons.

After loading the roughly ñ700kð file for standard Falcons i am confronted
with a simple selector using the TOS-console which lets me select wether i
prefer ñ100 Hzð on òVGAð or ñ50 Hzð on òRGBð.
So, let's go.
A relatively simple òMind Designð-logo in black/white is being displayed,
followed shortly by òThe Paranoid'sð ñLunatic Asylumð-logo done for the
óError in Line'99ð, which disappears quickly as well.
After that, a funky looking ñtorusð appears which seems to be made of ñblue
glassð - at least it looks like that as it ñrotates, moves and zoomes all 
ñover the screenð.
After a short while, it flashes within the beat of the music.
A little too early, the effect is stopped to make room for a new one.
In the next screen you have a ñtextured ceilingð and ñfloorð that move over
the screen in various directions with a white wireframe torus being moved
over the screen as well.
The texture seems to have something liquid metal-like in it and yes, after
a few seconds, the texture of the ceiling and floor start to ñwobbleð as
if they were ñliquidð - even though they wobble only ñ2Dð (in plane).
This effect stays on screen for a while.
But after all, it goes the ways all effects go and the last effect of the
demo is being shown. This time, you have a ñbrown/beige 2Dð plasma, which
is ñmoving and bendingð rapidly over the screen with one single ñlightflareð
on it. The ñcreditsð swing into the screen, they look rather ñunsharpð and
ñglowð a little, just as the ñlightflareð does, then slow down and swing
off the screen again.
The code has been done mainly by òDeezð with some additional code by
òThe Vikingð and the music by òBinarð.
Exit to desktop.

Running the version for óacceleratedð Falcons run the same series of 
effects in the same sequence but features a ñhigher resolutionð in most of
the effects and has a very cool looking ñgalaxy plasmað in the background
of the ñglass-torusð that consists of mild shades of red, brown and beige.
The other effects are being done in a higher resolution.

òMind Designð has done it again. A far too short demo that is so tasty and
well presented that one wishes they would kick out demos like that either 
more often or would expand them a little more.
But ñLemonð is definetly an intro that has some impact.
Even though the effects are not really ñstunningð in the first place, they
are - as usual - presented with so much style that they impress deeply 
though. The first effect has the typical "Oh, óthatð is new"-effect on most
of the viewers who have seen ñgouraud- and envmapped torið enough - 
especially with the ñcool-looking, moving centered plasmað behind it.
The second effect is not all new as well, but the combination of the rapidly
moving wireframe torus along with the ñbending texture for ceiling and 
ñfloorð has been done well to create a happy smile on the viewer's face as 
well. Finally, even the ñcreditsð are being brought onto the screen with
a touch of aristocracy and pride.
This surely renders òLemonð a good intro. Graphics are a bit weak, the
òMind Designð logo is a little rough and doesn't really go along with the
rest of the demo in choice of colours and style while the òLunatic Asylumð-
Logo - being an ST-Lowres graphic - doesn't fit into the demo very well
either, a true-colour picture featuring a similar choice of colours as the
rest of the demo has would have suited better.
Nevertheless, i am hoping to see longer productions from ñMind Designð in
the near future, those two swedes definetly have the potential to become
the most stylish crew currently active on the Falcon.
