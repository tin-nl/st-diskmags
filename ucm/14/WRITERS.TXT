                          THE GUILDE OF THE UCM WRITERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A year  is over again and another  one is standing  before us... There  are some
little changes  in the UCM posse and mOd of .tSCc. (or whatever) left  our lines
because of some reasons we don't know really.
Therefore it's time to drag two other guys into the spotlight. I decided to take
up 5o5 and  Paranoid into  the  regular posse  (hopefully) because it  isn't the
first time they're writing for us and as second, without their  massive help the
current issue of the UCM wouldn't be released today...
BUT this  means not that  they're members of the -poets of decay- (as maybe some
people will  think now)... this is just the label of the UCM, but  this magazine
is much more than just a pod-release rather it's a child of ALL the writers...
Ok... that's it... now it's time for some more strange words =)

                              THE REGULAR UCM POSSE
                            -------------------------

Ûmoondog - poets of decay

  Xmas is over now and little moondog is playing  with his new big shovel, Santa
  Claus brought him because his old one broke  down as he  tried to dig  out the
  grave of MAGGIE and he crashed through the bones of TAT (dead) of AVENA in the
  sandcase in the kindergarten.

ÛMC Laser - poets of decay^.tSCc.

  Do you know what it  means "shit happens"?! MCL knowns about it now! He wanted
  to have  a new noose for Xmas  but instead of reducing  it's noose  Santa just
  extended the curl on his head to restore the old proportions. So MCL is again
  the clown in his group at the kindergarten in Bellheim...

ÛEarX - Fun

  He got a new pair of wooden shoes for xmas, with autograms of Vrouw Antje! Bo!
  Now EarX is  dancing on the tables in his kindergarten in  Culemborg, ofcourse
  to crude loud and brutal music meanwhile his educator is trying  to reach some
  pastors to exorcise the electro devil of him!

ÛGrey - Mystic Bytes

  Meuh... Santa Claus  brought just a few sandsacks to the house  of his parents
  so that they're  prepared for the next flood  in spring. But  little Grey just
  smashed them off and  is building now mystic castles in  his garden, trying to
  loose not his breath...

Û5o5 - Checkpoint

  Little Nils sat down on the Xmas eve and nothing happened... untill he checked
  out that  he was sitting in  front of the  Yucca palm instead of the Xmas tree
  and as he entered  the living room  where all the things happened, his brother
  Norman had already grabbed the gifts and dragged to his own room...

ÛParanoid - Paranoia

  His parents were very angry about him at the Xmas eve as he tried to perform a
  breakdance show  to the Christmas carols below the Xmas tree! It took a lot of
  time to them  to dissolve  all the knots  between his  legs and limbs  and the
  branches of the Xmas tree...

                                 GUEST WRITERS
                               -----------------

ÛRequiem - Fatal Design

  On the Xmas eve he got a strange mail of a guy who offered him the possibility
  to open a domain on a server he hasn't heard of so far, and he did it, just to
  be sure that his letters to Santa Claus will arive quikly where they belong...
  Now  Requiems Atari.Org domain joined the Xmas.Orgy of Santa claus and  can be
  reached over atari.xmas.orgy... wow!

ÛMad Butscher - Foundation Two

  On Xmas eve little Thorsten was sitting down in front of his 8bit Atari. Why?!
  will you  surely ask me?! There is a simple reason  for this, his parents gave
  him the order  to code a game  as gift for himself... Ofcourse it's a hard job
  if you only released thinking games so far and like action games at all!
