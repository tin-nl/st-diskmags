                         UNITY '98 "PARTY" REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNITY??  Yes, UNITY.

I am  sure nobody  of you  has ever  heard  this name before. So did we (Defjam/
Checkpoint,  No/Escape, Joe_Cool/Checkpoint,  Antje,  505/Checkpoint), at  least
until we went there in a very spontanous action.

It was the  weekend of the GERMAN INTERNETSTRIKE, when we got to know about this
event, taking place in our town.

UNITY '98  was  organized  to  give  the  regional  demoscene  on  all systems a
possibility  to meet, because the last multisystem party in our town was held in
1992. Beside, it was a nice way of supporting the INTERNETSTRIKE.

The  party  was ORGANIZED BY some  Amigafreak, named Harald Krischna (Yes!:) and
took place here in DRESDEN.
It was  just a ONEDAY-PARTY (Sunday, 1st of November 1998) and it  began at 6:00
in the morning and ended at 8:00 pm.

It  already  was 7:00 pm  (or so) when we  arrived  from our  long and  nasty 10
minutes drive at the party place.
So only one  hour left, and so we hurried to check who is there and who is doing
what.

It was  announced that  there  is enough  room for 200-300  people. We  paid the
immense  entrance fee (5 DM) and started wondering, how 300 people should sit on
80 chairs.

Anyway, that was no problem, since there were no 200 or even 300 visitors there.
I  estimate, that  there were  40 people. As the  main  organizer  told  us, the
majority  already left  the  party, and  all  in  all  their  have been  ca. 120
visitors.

At  the  entrance  door, the  organizers  offered  BOCKWURST AND DRINKS, what  I
considered quite nice and useful.

Ok, let's take a look to the next important issue: THE BIG SCREEN. On the screen
you could  more or  less enjoy a lot of Amiga and C64 demos. Most of them seemed
to be very old. I wished, we would have any Atari with us to show and watch some
real demos on the big screen. But we hadn't.

So well, WHO WAS THERE? As  far as  I remember, there have been some Amiga, some
C64 and some PC-freaks.
But  strangely it  seemed, as they were doing  some serious  demostuff. At least
some of them looked like being creative.
Maybe 20 sat in front of their monitors and the other half was talking somewhere
in the mainhall...oops.. I meant mainroom :-)

We were  the only  Atarians here, but that was no surprise  for us. But  we were
surprised about the attitude of the visitors towards us.
Some of the  people we spoke there were quite pleased by the thought, that there
is still  an Atariscene  around. They asked if  there are  clones, and  the main
organizer even  asked, were to get a cheap ST and  Falcon. He intends  to open a
large  DEMO-BBS and FTP for all systems and asked us for some CDs full of Atari-
demos. Not that they really wanted to change to Atari, they just liked it :-)

Oops, I almost forgot the climax of Unity '98:

THE COMPETITIONS:

Well, what  to say  about that? There were  graphic  and music  competitions, as
promised in the invitation.
Some kind  of technical  problems made the compos appear pretty amusing. Instead
of  using  the (really  big) screen, the  visitors  were asked  to  come  to the
organizers  area, where all visitors had to  watch graphic  competiton  on a 19"
monitior :-)
The 2 entries for this competitions were quite.....well, quite rendered.

After that the 3 music entries were played for two minutes. Nothing special here
as well.

One of the PC-freaks released the only demolike thing. It ran out of competition
of course. It was a nice designed modulecompilation containing some demoeffects,
but not very spectacular ones for PCs.


Then the funniest part: THE ART OF VOTING

"Ok, who of you liked entry number one most? - Raise your hands now!"
Yeah, quite cool method to save our woods!

After some very unprecise handcounting, the results were known. The winners were
asked to take their prize and did so.

There were  5 prizes for 5 competitors and the thing was over. (I was 3rd in the
music competition btw ...argl! ...looser!... :-)



Well, not  too  much  to report  anymore, just  that  there  is a  little  local
demoscene, mainly  consisting of C64 and Amiga. Most of  them seemed  fortunatly
not to be lame.

It was nice to see that some guys in our region still have "the real feeling."
(C64, Amiga)

UNITY '98 was thought to reunit the local demoscene, and for that, it was ok.
Not a real big event at all, but a friendly meeting.

The organization  was well  done, because everything, that  was  promised in the
invitation, was realized.

The organizers  said, that  there will be followers of this party, probably in a
larger dimension, maybe in Autumn 1999. I suppose, we will be there again, since
we do not have to travel very far.


Things have to grow...
