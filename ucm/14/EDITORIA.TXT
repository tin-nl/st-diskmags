                     the autumn of life turns into winter
                        we are falling down like leafs
                    and grim reaper proves to be a tempter
                          what is left is our belief

                 is there someone waiting for you (or for me)?
                 is there someone waiting for you in eternity?

                        new generation has taken over
                           we are asking for advice
                    and grim reaper proves to be a drover
                           what is left is paradise

                 is there someone waiting for you (or for me)?
                 is there someone waiting for you in eternity?

         Before we're going straight to the points... just one minute...

We don't know if all have checked this information so far... but one of the most
exceptionally musicians of the ATARI SCENE ever has not only quitted  the scene,
he ended his life at the 19.11.1998...

                                 Xmas Terror
                               ---------------

                       I'm sitting under the Xmas tree,
                        A big red man looks down on me.
                       I have lost the smile in my face
                     Because Santa now has lifted his mace.
                       I looked into his big evil eyes,
                      Knowing all stories were just lies.
                       Santa Claus grabbed for his rod,
                        He want's to hit me, oh my God!
                      I tried to hide me behind the tree,
                       As the tree is falling down on me!
                    He's hunting me through the living room
                   I wanted to reach the cellars save gloom.
                     In a corner the hunt reached the end,
                       To save my head I rised my hands.
                     Santa was hitting the rod on my head,
                          Whaaa! I woke up in my bed!
                       I saw a big shadow on the floor,
                      Trying to escape through the door,
                       I looked up and saw Santa Claus,
                       He was trying to leave our house.
                   He turned his head and I saw in his eyes,
                     They were glowing, but warm and nice!
                       He stole a disk, this I have seen!
                       It was Undercover, issue fourteen!

Here we go again!

Even if the first lines in this editorial will darken the  whole event to read a
new issue of the UCM (hehe...) a bit, I think it's time to look forward, we have
lost  TOMMY, but we still have his musix, and besides the  thoughts to the death
we shouldn't forget the living ones! Maybe it sounds hard, but I learned to live
with the death, I'm facing it every day in my job...
Ok, it's another  thing, if a young guy looses his life but anyway, we shouldn't
fall into deepest mourning because it doesn't help us.

So you have to look at the coming  things! There are parties  coming up, stuffed
with releases and people, showing the world that the Atari scene isn't all other
than dead. Ok, we  don't stand  in the spotlight  but remember as Atarian you're
always a member of the digital underground!

At the moment I'm a bit  disturbed about  myself because  I spoke big  words and
promised the release of the UCM before Xmas, to give you the possibility to take
a disk, copy it to it and lay it below the Xmas tree...
Urg... shame  on me! But finally I'm lucky that the delay isn't as  big as we're
known for... 1o days instead of many weeks and months.

So, what can I write in this editorial? What about my first experiences in going
online? Why not?
As maybe known, I bought a PC too in  the middle of December and after I decided
to took the german Telekom  as provider it took just 4 days until I  was online,
real online, not only faked with AOL. And I'm very happy about this, because the
fucking AOL doesn't support 56k modems at all...
In this  short time since this event I got a real  Internet flash and I  hope to
install some frontiers to the use in the next weeks. But I think it's  the point
that I hadn't any chance to take a look in the web for many months now. And so I
visited  around 1oo different pages in the last days, I downloaded  about 3o MB,
mainly Atari related stuff, I stepped  through masses of ftp sites and finally I
called different german mailboxes.

But with  the time I checked that the real interesting stuff is  going on in the
IRC... yep! That's the so called  scene life! I met a lot of people in this time
and this is much more addictive than just surfing around! Hey! There is life!
And now I understand the importance of the  Internet for the Atari scene! I must
admit that I don't checked this massive  importance of the net  for the scene so
far, but I don't had the possibility to check it out and get a clue of it...
Now I see all things with other eyes and be sure, I'll stay online (untill I get
my first phone bill =) ...)

Ok... I think that's it for this  time... have to make some "final touches" now.
We have already the first Xmas day and I will not waste more time now...
So go ahead  and check out  the current  issue of UNDERCOVER... the zine for the
scene... Maybe you will miss some sections in this issue, so there  is NO coding
area (sniff), the charts are postponned to UCM # 15 (because the  lack of voters
this time, don't kick Grey for this! He don't had a clue of this!) and because I
had just a very few others I have thrown them all into the mixer...
But check it out by yourself!

Merry Xmas (eh...) and a Happy New Atari Year (after...)
