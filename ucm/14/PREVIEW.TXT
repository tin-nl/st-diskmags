                         PREVIEW TO UNDERCOVER # 15!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eh... again a preview? Yep, why not?!

So, here is a short snipped about the things to come with the next issue...

- A second special  about the Czech Atari Scene... I'm already working on it but
  I'm still on the hunt for more czech software. Up to now I got hold of several
  games  and some little demo stuffs, but I think there is still more around and
  so I decided to collect more to bring you a much bigger review next time...

- Hehe! moondog is online, do you know what will happen next time?! Yep! As long
  time ago  already announced, now I will make it real: the Atari Scene Homepage
  report series  will start next  time. So go ahead and update your pages before
  moondog is keeping an eye on them =)

- Another article  I started will  finally find  his end with  the next issue, I
  already started in October to write a big thing about the demo scene ten years
  ago... means 1988. Even if issue 15 will appear in 1999, I will go on to write
  about 1988... and I'm still on the hunt for old demos...
  
- Finally  we will bring the proof  for the information given  in UCM # 13, that
  EKO have opened  a furniture store! Unfortunately MC Laser don't matched it to
  supply those crazy things to me in time for this issue =(
  
- More? Of course! Besides the usual stuff we will try to review the releases of
  all  the forthcoming  parties, like IMP8, LAST PARTY and  last  but  not least
  VOLCANIC 5...
  
- Hmmm... I  think it's  all for this time, so  be prepared for another  slap in
  your face in very early spring next year, hehe!
