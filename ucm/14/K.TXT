                       ñKð (Preview) by òExað ó(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hujia ... If this isn't the game everyone is talking about without having seen a
preview ... Then ñwhichð game is it?

Well, I ñhaveð seen a  playable preview  and this is what this review is about, so
here we go.

In an ñintroð with nice pictures by òFlanð and music by òZigoð the makers of the game,
the code is by òElendilð, are being displayed as well as a nice óExað-Logo and later
on, a really neat ñ"K"ð-logo.

After loading shortly, the main menu is displayed with a funny animated font and
some nice music.
Most  of the ñoptionsð are  disabled  however as  this is a preview, in  fact, the
preview version only offers to ñplay one trackð.

Okay, let's get to it.
The screen  of the game is  split into two halfs, the lower part of  it displays
the ñspeedometer, extra collected, lap-counterð etc. The  upper half of the screen
shows the ñmain gameð, the racetrack in 3D.
If you have seen the entracte 96ktro by óExað, you can imagine what it looks like,
the ñGreetings-ðpart of this intro looks pretty similar.

At the start, 4 karts are shown and as the lights go green, the race starts. The
player  can control his  kart with  the ñjoystickð or the ñkeyboardð, òCTRLð activates
an item if one has been picked up and òALTð or òfireð makes the kart jump.
Additionally, the  keys ò1ð and ò2ð switch on/off the landscape scrolling, this will
of course affect the speed of the 3D-display.
And that's all their actually is you need to know to play "óKð".
So you drive  along the track, try  to be as fast as your  opponents, drive over
specially coloured circular fields that contain ñextrasð like speed-ups ...
The bonus  you picked up  is being displayed in the lower part of  the screen of
course.

The track can consist of several types of ground, like sand or water, which will
of course  affect the  speed of your  kart. In contrast to òAtari-kartsð, you sink
slowly into the water.
There are also special items on the ground which make you for example speed up -
like the arrow-fields in òAtari-kartsð do.
Your kart  however skids  a lot easier  than in  òAtari-kartsð - and  even worse -
without warning. So you should adjust to the controls before really getting into
the game.

The  ñgraphicsð are  good  and  the ñspritesð look  cute  and are  animated  nicely,
although there aren't too many sprites on the screen yet.
The ñlandscapeð and everything around looks good as well.
The ñmusicð is very  nice indeed and  even the ñsound-effectsð suit  the  game well.
Together with the funny main menu, the ñoverall designð is really very good.

The ñ3D-engineð is absolutely suitable for a game like this. The perspective being
used allows a ògood view aheadð - better than in the ñ2-player modeð of òAtari-kartsð,
although  it is  being ó"cut"ð - meaning that objects  are not being  moved at you
from ñinfinityð, but from a rather limited distance.
Although  this seems a  bit unusual at first, it turns  out to be  very ñpositive
indeed - the  distance from  which objects  are being  displayed  is  absolutely
appropriate and this way, the ñ3D-engineð is of course faster.

So here we consider the speed: So far, a simple Falcon is absolutey suitable for
playing "óKð" - No  accelerator  is  needed, although  the  game  runs  on Nemesis
without any problems.

Another  game  added  to  the "wanted badly"  list. òWillie's adventuresð, òReeking
òRubberð have been  on the  list  already, and now, ò"K"ð is  definetly  one of  the
highlights in Falcon gaming still to come.
The preview  makes your  mouth water for more as it is technically ñbrilliantð and
ñdesignedð perfect as  well. Speed, playability, graphics, sound  and music all go
along very  very well and  even the  rather short  demo-track is already  fun to
play.
Keep it going, óExað, so far you have done òDAMNð good job.
