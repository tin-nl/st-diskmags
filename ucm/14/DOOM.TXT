     ñDoom v.06ð by òData of Trioð (1998) [óFalconð] - original Doom C-Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------     

Doom ... Show me ñoneð Falcon  user who wouldn't like to see this game in suitable
speed on his machine.
And òBad Moodð  or óData'sð  very  own  òDSP-based Doom engineð showed  that  Doom  in
suitable speed would be possible on the Falcon indeed.
Yet all these programs had one major disadvantage - they weren't playable.
And although it  can be fun  for a while just to run around in a few levels, the
fun and action of the original ñDoomð hasn't made its way to the Falcon ...
... that was until  now. ñidð Software  released the sources for the original ñDoom
and òPatrice Mandinð aka òData of Trioð compiled the sources for the ñUnix version of
ñDoomð using GCC on MiNT and released it as ñDoom v0.01ð.
After solving  a few problems  on the óVGA-monitorð (v0.03) and fixing some errors
in the  lighting engine  (v0.05), he now  releases version ò0.06ð with  minor bugs
fixed and the lighting perfectionised.

You need  a ñDoomð òWADð-file, either  from the  original ñDoom 1ð, ñDoom 2ð, ñUltimate
ñDoomð or commonly available, the òsharewareð ñDoom-WADð.
These òWADð-files  contain all  graphics, all sounds, all samples and  all levels.
The ñDoomð-program  itself  is  just  the  ògraphic-, sound- and  game  engineð, all
relevant data is óinð the òWADð-file.

The control  device is  the keyboard as  a default and all the original keys are
being  used. Cursor  keys to  move, SHIFT for  run, ALT for  strafe, CONTROL  to
shoot, space  to activate  buttons/open doors, ESC for the menu, 1 to 6  for the
weapons and the numeric keyboard for screen-size options.
Even the original cheats (ñIDKFA, IDDQD, IDCLIP etc.ð) work.
There is yet no sound.

This is the first playable ñreal Doomð on the Falcon ever, but the word "playable"
is a bit brave. On ordinary Falcons, it isn't playable. It is simply too slow to
play. This is  not very astounding  as this  port of ñDoomð is only 68030 code and
does ónotð use the DSP  for anything. Since every Falcon owner knows that the real
power of  the Falcon  lies in the òDSPð and not  in the  rather slow  16 MHz ò68030
(Hi SWE! :-), it is  obvious for anybody that a ñDoomð version not  using  the òDSP
can not be played very well.
Using  simple  accelerators  like  òCPU-doublersð, óSkunk, FX card etc.ð solves  the
problem a  little. Playing ñDoomð in  a medium sized  window in low  resolution is
possible  using the óNemesisð or óCenTurbo 1ð-speeder, but gets very slow  in higher
levels as the rooms get larger and the sprite movement increases.
With a óCenTurbo 2ð, you can play ñDoomð a lot  better. Even in  larger windows, the
average  speed of the game is suitable, although I would still  recommend to use
low resolution. An óAfterburner 040ð of course will make ñDoomð fly on the Falcon.

Version 0.06 of  this ñDoomð-port looks best so far. The lighting now is clean and
shiny and looks like the original versions on the PC. I have the impression that
this version  is a òbitð slower than the previous  one, v0.05, but this  is rather
a personal impression.
From what I have learned  in the documentation, òPatrice Mandinð is currently busy
to build a compromise between his own ñDSP-Doomð and the original ñDoomð.
It looks rather  like he will  make his own ñDSP-Doom (v0.8)ð, which now  features
the  possibility  of  playing  music  by  a  òMIDI-instrument-emulationð, playable
instead of replacing the ògraphic engineð in the original ñDoomð with his  own, òDSP-
òbasedð one - since  he seems to  know a lot more about ñDoomð than anybody  else on
the  Falcon - especially  now  that  the ñBad Moodð development  group  fell  into
eternal sleep, I guess he knows which approach is better.

ñDoomð may be  outdated now  that there are no ónon-3D gamesð anymore on the PC or
the Playstation, but as  usual, the original is still one of the best. Some even
more advanced 3D games on the PC  look rather sad in comparison to the thrill of
the  original  ñDoomð, as  the  leveldesign, the  graphics, the  sprites  and  the
atmosphere are still exciting and unique.
So if you call an accelerated Falcon your  own, grab the shotgun, search for the
BFG-9000 and shoot everything in your way. Even in medium sized windows with 4 -
10 frames a second, ñDoomð is one hell of a bloodbath.
