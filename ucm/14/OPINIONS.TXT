                               Reader's Suggestions           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Someday on #atariscne I have seen an interesting chat about Undercover mag
 between two chaps.  They were  talking about  'bad points' of UCM but  weren't 
 going to  send their opinions directly to  Moondog. In that case I  decided to 
 collect all opinions into one article and hide nicknames  of readers =) I just
 got an idea  to send e-mails  to bunch of  my scene  mates with  the following 
 subject "Message to brave UCM readers" =) and a question  "what would you like 
 to change in UCM?" etc.  I got a  couple answers  and while I am here  I would 
 like to thank all those brave UCM readers who sent me their opinions! 
 No worries, they stood as anonymous, just like promised =)

                                                           grey / mystic bytes
                                                           
 moondog's note: hehe... anyway I will give  some comments to the  one or other
                 thing written in here...
                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    There  are just some  small things that annoys me when  reading UCM. First,
the  common use of  curses and swear  words, such as  'fucking' and so on, that
was quite  frequent in the  previous issues (can't  recall seeing  that much in
the  last issue  though, #13). I don't think  that it's  necessary to use  such
language to express anything.

    The second thing  are those  personal  attacks that has been  in the recent
issues of UCM.  I think that  these attacks should  be carried out  outside  of
the  magazine.  At  least I have  no interest  in reading that  stuff. I'm  not
going to  mention what  I think are the reasons for these  personal offensives, 
because that will just start another battle...

    Besides of these points, I think that UCM is quite  a good mag. It has some
things that for example Maggie lacks, such as  a complete  e-mail  address list 
of most people  connected to the scene.  In my opinion  Maggie and  UCM doesn't 
compete. They complement each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just stop  the slagging and  the "fuckings"! It is just  boring to read and 
gives an unserious impression. 

    Otherwise its a great Mag!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    UNDERCOVER  means that isnt usualy stuff, but that also means not LOTSA ppl 
will do that unusal stuff. And  UNDERCOVER  also don't automaticaly means "fuck 
all normal world" macho things like that.. Whole point lies in that: for me the 
MOST important article (I read that always 1st) is editors  note... and if that 
is offensive, childish  and really stupid  (as maggie say:  "so moondog have to 
work,  the rest of world  just sit all day  doing nothing") I loose  all joy to 
read stuff further.. and if I found similar  articles I stop  reading (I didn't 
read all last UCM). 

    Shame is also that for Moondog non-demo scene, like MiNT, games, utils, bla 
bla, means SHIT.... He clearly showed  that, non-sceners  (non demo coders) for 
him does NOTHING.. he clearly writed that with lotsa "F" words.... 
And that is LAME!

moondog's note: Which UCM do you don't red completely? The 13? But it seems as
                you enjoyed Maggie's piss off action? Strange thing... I don't
                like MiNT and will never write about, if some other will do it
                I have no problems  with it... I NEVER  wrote that  those guys
                are shit! I think you have to get some glasses... UCM is a mag
                for the DEMO/HACKING/GAMERS scene  and so the main  topics are
                around  this themes. If you haven't checked this  so far, your
                fault! Maybe other magazines featuring this topics, UCM did it
                never in its last 5 years, because MiNT  and so on  were never
                the main interests (or of any interest at all) of the writers.
                So why we should write about? It's  thought as scene magazine,
                and we definitly  mean the  demo scene... But  AGAIN, we NEVER
                wrote that  the actions  on the  Atari scene at  all are shit,
                they just don't match  really to  the UCM... So read twice and
                over all think twice! And  last but  not least I  use the word
                FUCK as much as I want, even if some guys don't like it, we're
                living in a free world where everyone can say  what he thinks,
                even if some guys take it as sign that you're  limited, but if
                they think so, they have to check themselves at first...

    Sorry to dissapoint you, but scene news in UCM are awfull inacurate. And if
I send message to Maggie that something is wrong,  I get "thank you"  reply not
"fuck off, do it yourself".

moondog's note: Our news are awfull inacurate?! Check out the  word rumours! We
                know about some mistakes at  all... but I'm SURE  I never wrote
                to you (even if I don't know who you are) that you have to fuck
                you and do it by your own... 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Biggest  crap is attitude  of main editor... Last I want to see on scene is
those "F" words (you know what words I mean)  just because we were waiting hard 
for ucm.. and like we all just sit at home and do nothing... well few articles, 
main ppl attitude, etc..

    I have lost faith in  moondog,  esp. after  his anti-falcon  article. Sorry  
but  that's how I feel.  I think mod and 505s  articles are good and  uplifting
(eg, they talk about things in a normal way, not only negative way).

moondog's note: Which faith?! I'm not God and you don't have to pray to me... I
                wrote at first  no ANTI FALCON  article and second it's my very
                private  view... and last but not  least I  will never  hide my
                feelings while writing an article!
