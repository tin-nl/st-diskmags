Welcome to another issue of "Vibrations reviewed."
For those, who  didn't know. This article is aimed to review, examine, critisize
and rate  musics, that were created with  trackerprograms on our  beloved Atari-
computers  and  of  course  to give  some feedback  in  order  to  motivate  the
composers.

Maybe someone wants any of his/her tracks to be reviewed and I didn't yet.
Maybe someone will not agree to my opinion about different songs.
I cannot change that, but you. Make me stop or start reviewing your work at
fiveofive_cp@hotmail.com


This issue:

This time I tried to review the following songs:

1. - "Bonus!"                    by Toodeloo  / Dead Hackers Society
2. - "Chippin'for Zeldair"       by MSG       / Reservoir Gods
3. - "Mongolia"                  by Dma Sc    / Sector One
4. - "One Glass of Water"        by Toodeloo  / Dead Hackers Society
5. - "Pagnanelli"                by Toodeloo  / Dead Hackers Society
6. - "Remarkable"                by Toodeloo  / Dead Hackers Society

8. - "UCM #13 - Introtrack"      by The Viking/ Mind Design

Wow! -  8 songs! Ok, it isn't very much this time, but  at least I  tried to get
deeper into the songs and took me some more time, than in the last issue.

1. - "Bonus!"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in "Digital Relaxation" - musiccompilation by Yescrew
Format:        unknown
Style:         Pianosong
Source:        http://dhs.atari.org


Ding - DANG - Ding - DANG ... it  says.  A  rythmical  offbeat-driven  piece  of
instrumental sound is the "bonustrack" of the Digital Relaxation musiccompil.
Very relaxed and peaceful.

Well, what  should I say, some nice sound, but not more than nice. It is nothing
than a  little melody surrounded by some accords. The melody itself is  not bad,
but nothing what I would call great either.

After ca. 30 seconds the song loops and restarts.


Ideas          ?        20% - the sound of the little song is not bad
                            - the sound of the little song is not good
                            - some 30  seconds - song makes me suppose, that the
                              maker was quite out of ideas ;)
Composition    ?        30% - hmmm...  actually no labour
                            - offbeat rules
Sound quality  ?        80% - the piano sample sounds good
                            - this is the only sample
General Kick   ?        30% - would  have  been  nice, if it  were  some longer,
                              because  the "first" 30  seconds aren't bad  for a
                              introduction..
                            - listen to  this song for 2 minutes only and you go
                              mad! (too short)
                        __
Overall        ?        40% - I write the ratings  live. That  means the  song I
                        ==    currently review is played meanwhile  I am typing.
                              And I  have to  admit that  this  song goes  on my
                              nerves  after  some  10 minutes  of  listening  to
                              always the same.

2. - "Chippin'for Zeldair"

Author:        Msg/Reservoir Gods
Released:      in "The Legend of Zelda" - NES-conversation (GBX) for Falcon
Format:        .mod (4-channel)
Style:         chip
Source:        http://dhs.atari.org


The  GBX-improved  version  of  the  NES-conversation  "Legend of Zelda" by  the
Reservoir Gods features some music by MSG again.
This time, it  is the chipmodule-remake of the classic gametheme. Surely most of
you  know  the fantastic  melody  of the  original. This  one was  converted  to
Protracker in an excellent way.

The famous  leads are  echoed very nice, by using two channels and make the song
appear  very professional. The whole conversation of the leads is great - so you
get very cool "rythmical delays" and "triols" - as in the original.

The accords  are nice designed  with some echoed and not easy to do "beeps". The
overall sound in the beginning is can be called "very pleasant to listen too."

MSG's version  is quite similiar  to the original, but  the bass is played by an
old  and  in  my opinion  overused "digdug"-bass. Beside a  simple  drumline  is
kicking the song forward. From time to time you also get some "pizza-strings."
Those are nicely used, very decent, to round up the whole thing.

The song  is divided in "normal" and some kind  of atmospheric  parts. Those are
characterized by a variation of the original melody. The variation is maybe even
in the original, I don't know.
However, this  variation  sounds  partly good, partly I  don't like  it, because
there is too much "playaround" for my taste.
The good parts of it are some cool and harmonic melody developments, which sound
like having knowledge about the theory of harmonyconstruction and such.

One more thing  to critisize: After having listened to the song for some time, I
recognized, that the track is actually always the same.
The  variation is  the big  exception of course, but  in general, the  maintheme
repeats  too often. Some different parts or more variations would have been nice
here.

At least  I think  that the  song may get boring if you  play the  game for some
hours. But on its own it is a nice track and another chipmod worth to have.

Nobody should get hurt, but I have to rate the originality of a remix very low.


Ideas          ?        15% - since it  is no  original track, there is not much
                              originality in the conversation
                            - the way  of using  the "pizzastring" is an  idea I
                              like
                            - some  parts of the (probably selfmade) "variation"
                              sound cool
Composition    ?        75% - the core of  the songs  repeats too often  and the
                              development of  the  song  isn't  surprising - you
                              almost always know what will come next
                            - the "variation" sounds a bit strange in my ears
                            - great conversation of the lead!
                            - excellent use of echo and this even in 4 channels
                            - cool "accord-enviroment" (beeps!)
Sound quality  ?        75% - nothing  to worry about, except, that  chipsamples
                              sound unclean in general
                            - good sidleadsamples
General Kick   ?        75% - very  nicely  struggling  forward  for  the  first
                              minutes, unfortunatly  it stays the same for a too
                              long time, especially regarding that it is a game-
                              song
                        __
Overall        ?        60% - Surely, it isn't easy to convert such an difficult
                        ==    melody and accords to  Protracker, at least if you
                              do it by listening. So, well done!
                            - However,  the  percentage  of  the  rating  result
                              suffers from the  fact, that the  song is  still a
                              conversation - but it is a cool one!

3. - "Mongolia"

Author:        Dma Sc/Sector One
Released:      in Irc: #Atariscne
Format:        .mod (4-channel)
Style:         chip
Source:        Dma Sc/Sector One


This is the conversion of the  cool soundchip  track by mad max, which  was used
for the "There aren't many sheep in outer mongolia" - screen in the "Ooh Crickey
wot a Scorcher"-demo by The Lost Boys.

The original is  hardly to improve  I think. However, Dma Sc  tried  it by using
Protracker STe. The first  thing to regard is, that it isn't as easy as it seems
to convert chipmusics to good modfiles.
At first  you need good sound and good instruments, and further you need to know
the original in detail.
Dma Sc knows the original very well and he converted the whole song by listening
to the modformat, as he told me which is a remarkable effort.

The whole  track is very similiar to its source, but it uses  some more C64-like
chipsamples  than   Yamaha-soundchip-sounds. These  sound  ok,  although  a  bit
oldfashioned and simple overall.
But the  conversation of  the notes is done very precisly and detailed, a really
good job. All  the different parts sound good, no wrong notes or  something like
that.

Of course  some things have been changed or are added. Protracker modules have 4
channels, that  means one  channel more than the soundchip-version you  can make
use of.
So your  ears hear a modern dance beat with a dancy bassline in different parts.
This  isn't too  original or great, rather simple  even, but it pulls  the whole
song forward, especially in parts where it could get boring.

Generally the  song is very similiar to the  soundchipsong by  Mad Max, but this
somehow is an element of conversions.

It isn't  easy to  rate remixes  in the  same way  as original  mods, since they
aren't  really  original. I could say  that  they are  generally  worse than the
original, because the core wasn't done by yourself.
But then  there are  points that are totally new ideas, that sound  different to
the original or that are even better than the original.
But I cannot  give as many points for the originality anyway, because  the ideas
are still stolen in a way.

The original  ideas were by Mad Max, hard to say if a copy is original  as well.
The  conversation  does  not  feature  any  genious  improvements  or  something
similiar, but  it is  a brave try to convert  this hard  stuff, especially since
there are loads of complicated and difficult to convert noteconstructions.


Ideas          ?        15% - not "original" at all, but a brave attempt
                            - some average stuff added
Composition    ?        90% - very complicated stuff in the original - excellent
                              and  detailed converted, which means a lot of work
                              and patience
Sound quality  ?        60% - average
                            - "not-my-taste" - chipsamples
General Kick   ?        90% - A great original - a great conversation
                        __
Overall        ?        64% - I am really sorry for this result. This chipmodule
                        ==    honestly  is  one  of  the  best  soundchip-to-mod
                              conversations I ever heard so far.
                              Just, that  I cannot  give a  conversation as many
                              points  for  originality  as  for  originals, they
                              finally are not original.
                              It stays a "copy" of ideas, especially if it isn't
                              much improved or changed. But it can kick!
                            - And I  definitly recommend  this track to everyone
                              who  likes  Mad Max - chipmusics  or  chipmods  in
                              general.

4. - "One Glass of Water"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in "Digital Relaxation" - music compilation by Yescrew
Format:        unknown
Style:         Drunken?

Piano accords  in minor, that could belong to a housetrack  are the beginning of
this song, which reveals to become a slow and relaxed kind of a ballad.

The song  mainly consists  of pianos. There is a nice, but  not too  outstanding
pianomelody  which is accompagnied by some cool bass. The bass is sliding around
and gives the track a pleasant groove.

But honestly  it is mostly  the bass, I like. The rest is very simple, some kind
of unrythmic and unspecial.

A drumsolo  is following and later something strange, you could call chipbass is
playing.

That's already all about this track. It is rather short again.


Ideas          ?        20% - I am sorry, but  there  is  nothing  that  made me
                              enthusiastic about this song
Composition    ?        15% - A cool sliding bass
                            - the rest cannot be called better than average
Sound quality  ?        85% - everything is fine here
General Kick   ?        20% - Actually not much that kicks, the song is rather a
                              confused thing, that sounds like being "hacked" in
                              some minutes
                        __
Overall        ?        30% - I have to confess, that this song is not more than
                        ==    disappointing.  Toodeloo  has  done  much   better
                              before, but  maybe this track is an old one, or it
                              probably  has  been  made  in a state of too-much-
                              (fire)water?  ;)

5. - "Pagnanelli"

"Pagnanelli" seems  to be some strange sort of chiphousemusic. House, because of
the "housy" accords  and chip, because a  typical chipbass  is used to  give the
whole thing some groove.

In my  opinion this sort of musics doesn't sound  cool at all. Maybe  it is just
that I am neither a big fan of house nor of chipmodules.

Anyway, not  to forget, there  is some nice  beepy  melody "jumping" around this
song  from time to time. This melody is the nice part of this track although its
overall length is probably not more than 10 seconds.

In other words a very very short track again, about which I don't have very much
to say about.


Ideas          ?        30% - some nice little melody
                            - some short little melody
                            - a very very short track
Composition    ?        40% - some nice bass
                            - are short songs in fashion?
                            - very unspecial
Sound quality  ?        50% - noisy chipsamples
General Kick   ?        20% - the melody could kick in another enviroment
                        __
Overall        ?        35% - Honestly I  think, that there  is no  need to have
                        ==    this song on your harddisk.

6. - "Remarkable"

Some really  enjoyable  soft strings  make the  start of  this song. They  sound
excellent arranged and make you lean back, if you want or not.
Next some bassline kicks in, which improves the "relaxation" some more.
Some drums jump around to make it rounded up.

Finally  the first melodic  part appears, which is signified by some nice echoed
and distorted guitars. A very atmospheric part till now.

Then  some strings  try to  build up a nice  melody, but  do not  succeed, in my
opinion.
A following part, mostly consisting of stringaccord arrangement is nicer again.
Soon after that, the song will loop again.

A  song, that  creates  a  nice  mood - neither  negative  and  depressing - nor
positive and happy. It is just relaxing.



Ideas          ?        70% - nice E-guitars and string-dominated part
                            - a good atmosphere, a kind of peaceful (not easy to
                              do, as I think)
                            - but actually no special ideas
Composition    ?        60% - the accords are very well chosen
                            - the song is a bit short after all
                            - some melodyparts sound "bad"
Sound quality  ?        80% - nothing to  complain, except  some  little  noise,
                              which is possibly created by the sampleloops
General Kick   ?        70% - the song creates an excellent mood
                            - some  melodyparts  sound  strange   and  make  the
                              listener be confused
                        __
Overall        ?        70% - This  song  is  definitly  worth to  have  on your
                        ==    harddisk, in case you need to relax sometimes.
                              Nothing  really  unbelievable in this track, but I
                              think  it features  several  nice parts, which can
                              make you pretty calm down.

7. - "Treo"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in "Digital Relaxation" - musiccompilation by Yescrew
Format:        unknown
Style:         Funk
Source:        http://dhs.atari.org


This song begins  with  some  nice  accord  riffs, which  are  sometimes echoed,
sometimes  not. I don't  like that, because  I either want them to be  echoed or
not. Anyway, how is the song developing?
Later, some 70-synthy-sounds and a groovy bassline join in. All in all it sounds
bloody funky! Especially  the bass, which is a bit unrythmic after  all, but the
slapping method is used very good.
Beside  some more or less cool effects you get a hectic drumline. Which give the
track it's final groove.

When you  listen to this song the first time, you may consider  it easily as too
funky  and maybe  even  confusing, since  there  is  not a real  leading melody.
Probably  those "70-synthy-sounds" were  aimed  to represent  the melody, but it
doesn't sound too good.

After some  50 seconds  or so, the  song seems to repeat, which doesn't  make me
give any plus-points to it.

But what  I admire is the funky appearance of this song. My own experience tells
me, that this  stuff is  not easy to do - especially finding a groovy bass, that
fits to the accords and to the melody.

A nice "theme", but really far too short to call it a nice "song".


Ideas          ?        40% - the  ideas, that  can be found  in this  track are
                              good. I like the use of the "60-synthy"-sounds
                            - Unfortunatly  this  song is very  short, so  there
                              aren't many ideas included automatically.
Composition    ?        50% - the good part here is definitly the funky bass
                            - the song is very short
                            - I dare to call the melody "not more than average
Sound quality  ?        80% - good, except  the noisy  effectsample/cymba/hihat/
                              whatever
General Kick   ?        50% - it kicks for 2 minutes, then it gets boring
                        __
Overall        ?        55% - This song is  too short  but  worth  listening to,
                        ==    once in a while. If it is worth keeping it on your
                              harddisk depends. If you have 80 MB and 2 MB free,
                              as me, then it is not.

8. - "UCM #13 - Introtrack"

Author:        The Viking/Mind Design
Released:      in "Undercover Magascene 13 Intro" by Mind Design
Format:        unknown
Style:         Goachip
Source:        Poets of Decay


Goa!! Cool  chippy goaleads  kick in  and get accompagnied by some nice, but too
slow drums. A nice groove developes out of this original mixture.
Some  decent and pleasant beeptones from time to time and BOOM! - the end of the
track.

This is when I try to describe a ca. 80 second music piece, while listening.

Actually, I think  this  track is  an excellent one, because I like  the idea of
connecting  chipmusic with "something like goa." At least for me  it sounds like
goa, but I am not a master in saying which category a song belongs to.

However, this  song is surely one of the best done by The Viking and does fit to
the intro very well.


Ideas          ?        75% - the goa-idea is impressing
                            - groovy bass
Composition    ?        70% - very short song
                            - nice lead and bass construction
                            - the drums sound a bit too slow for my feeling
                            - not boring
                            - cool stereoeffects
Sound quality  ?        65% - ok, but noisy chipleads..
General Kick   ?        80% - a fine moving forward character
                            - drumspeed makes it appear a bit too soft
                        __
