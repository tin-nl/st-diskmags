life is an absurded horror, devoid of all meaning
who or what will take care of us when we die?
the angels? god? satan? or just the nothingness?
it cannot be! you reply emphatically, but what if
there's nothing there but cold, mindless emptiness?
we must make an idol out of our fear
and this idol shall be called god.

                       "DOWN AND OUT" by CAT RAPES DOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by SubSpace Communications 1998

Wow! The swedish  crossover terrorists are back with a  new single! And this one
kicks ass like hell! I don't know if all  of you know the kind of  music CRD are
making. Since  the late  eighties/early nineties  they're tormenting  the masses
with a  strange melange of  metal/electro crossover, but not in the way as known
from acts like OOMPH!, The Armageddon Dildos or so... no, furthermore  they have
involved something like  a fun attitude to their songs... and so their sometimes
real apocalyptic sound brings even a grin on your face! Great!
This single is no exception and you will find the following tracks on it...

o1. Down And Out (mutilated version)
o2. Down And Out (remix)
o3. Human Remix
o4. Water (live)
o5. Moosehair Underwear (live)

Harg! Even  if the lyrics  of "DOWN AND OUT" seem to be earnest  and depressing,
lately if you have heard the latest phrases the fun effect comes up again... but
just check them out at the end of this article =)
Anyway, the first "Down And Out" version comes along real funny. Pumping electro
stuff, a bit technoing, the rough voice of the singer accompanied  with the high
and clear voice of the female singer... sounds really strange. The melody sounds
sometimes a bit childish and the art of presentation is real crude! Nice!
The second version starts on with much more metal guitar stuff, accompanied with
technoing  bass which remembers me hard to the old dutch hardcore stuff! Strange
but cool!
The next one is my favourite song! The whole, completely electronic track, lives
of the voice of their female singer. It's  fast electro/techno stuff which gives
her the possibility to test out  every accent of  her voice. Sounds  great and I
think she has one of the most impressing voices in the electronic music scene!
The next two lifetracks gave a good impression of the atmosphere at  their gigs.
Esp. the second one, much faster  than the first, lives from the  strange lyrics
and again hard metal attacks. "Geil!" I would say in german!

More to say? No! It's a cool single, worth the money  without any  doubt because
it nearly has some EP standard. Btw. the whole cd was mixed by  Eskil Simonsson,
do you remember the swedish electro band COVENANT?! Any questions?! I think not.
Ok... and last but not least the lyrics of "Down And Out"...

Down And Out
------------

Everything you do, you do in vain
But I try to endure, to take the pain
My heart beats still, but all hope is gone
Life turns off as easily as it turns on

What will happen to me when I die
I don't wanna go to heaven
And in hell's where I've been all my life
All my life

I have outlived the usefulness of my life
I'll end it all with this poisoned knife
I hate myself and I want to die
I'm not worthy to be alive

What will happen to me when I die
I don't wanna go to heaven
And in hell's where I've been all my life
All my life

Those who plan to go to heaven
Behave as if on drugs
Ain't no heaven, ain't no hell
Just get eaten by bugs

What will happen...


Hua! Nice, eh?!
