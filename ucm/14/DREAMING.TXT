                          "DREAMING APES" by WOLFSHEIM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Strange Ways 1996

To shorten the  time till the  release of the new WOLFSHEIM album "Spectators" a
bit I decided to review their last studio album.
I think I don't  have to write much about  the band itself, WOLFSHEIM are really
wellknown, not only  in the dark scene. Since  the early nineties they belong to
the  spear tips  of the german synth pop  scene and I would  call them  the most
important act besides DE/VISION at all.
The brand  sign of WOLFSHEIM is  besides the  mainly very  silent and  slow used
synth sound that kicks the voices in the foreground, the voice of Peter Heppner.
His  voice is without any  doubt the most melancholic and depressing  one in the
whole music scene at all! Even songs with more or less funny contents will get a
very depressing touch just because of his voice...
Ok... I will go on with the review, starting with the contents of this album:

o1. Upstairs
o2. Traces Of China
o3. Closer Still
o4. A New Starsystem Has Been Explored
o5. India Theme
o6. A Million Miles
o7. La Dance Du Soleils
o8. Old Man's Valley
o9. Leave No Deed Undone
1o. A Rambling Shadow
11. Anyway
12. šbers Jahr
13. Old Piano Theme
14. A Broken Whisper

Wow! Fourteen songs, may  you say... nope =( ... at first  this  CD has  only  a
playlength of  37 minutes and  4 "songs" are just short instrumentals and sound-
collages... so finally we have a net of 1o songs in about 35 minutes.
Err... But before  you think "Why he's  calling  them -spear tip- if  they don't
even match it  to produce an album of average lenght?" I  have to say  that this
album features really  a lot  of nice songs which  underline their  state in the
german darkpop scene.

The top  songs, at least  for  me, are "Closer Still", "A Million Miles", "šbers
Jahr" and "A Broken Whisper", but the  others  are great  too! The sound  varies
from fast synthpop pearls up to sad piano dominated tracks... and I  mean really
sad! I  don't know  why, but if you're a  bit nerved  or depressive  at all  you
should never  listen to a WOLFSHEIM  song! They spread so  fucking sadness! It's
really  amazing! But  hey... I want to talk too much about  them... their  sound
can't be described with  words and ofcourse their lyrics are very  important too
and so here they come!
Just to mention is the point that two songs with german lyrics are included this
time, their classic one "šbers Jahr" and "A New Starsystem Has Been Explored".
I will type in the english translations for better understanding =)

Upstairs
--------

I am dreaming, I'm screaming
but making no sound
I'm the nightmare from upstairs
and I'm coming down

From silence to violence
in a single step
Try to leave or retrieve
what I can't forget

I can see what I'll be
when I'm going on
I can't heal it, can't feel
if I'm doing wrong

It's burning, it's yearning
it's spinning around
Let it shout, tear it out, save me
from this unholy being...


Closer Still
------------

The watery light that mirrors ion your
desireable eyes
The way you move your lips
While talking to somebody else
I move a little closer just to hear
what you say
You speak of loneliness but here's a soul
adoring you

It's a wounded heart
It breaks in two
And in its pain
It sings for you

It's a wounded heart
That feels afraid
Moves closer still
Fulfills its fate

Your freedom's poverty that
you do not recognize
The way you stalk the night
While talking to somebody else
I move a little closer just
to know who you are
A slightly glowing ember
I'm the breeze igniting you


A New Starsystem Has Been Explored
----------------------------------

Is this still my face?
I can't hear my voice!
I'm frightened of seeing,
In case this makes it all disappear.

My heart beats so fast.
The pain is so bad.
What a great gero of stars
Whose words fall to dust!

I've seen the death of the suns!
They were so red with heat...
So incredibly beautiful!

Deep-Space-Overdose
Free and unrestrained
Deep-Space-Overdose
Lost without a hope

Is this the dull bang
With which time began?
I'm frightened of seeing,
I could never end!

The world is a shadow
Unrequited desires.
Man's blind dream
Lost in light and space.

I've seen the death of suns!
They were so blue with cold...
So incredibly beautiful!

Deep-Space-Overdose
Deep and borderless
Deep-Space-Overdose
Old and restless


A Million Miles
---------------

A million miles from here
I stand alone and shout
Not any thoughts, not any doubts

I look around and nothing
I can see is true
This is anything but new

I feel a silent rain
pour down impassively
A solemn nightfall kills the light
that longs to be...

A needless pain...
You bear in vain...
Unless you can see
there is nothing to sustain


Old Man's Valley
----------------

I said goodbye to the river...
the mountains and the trees
Can't you hear they are singing
their song of birth and agony

I said goodbye to the seasons that were never insincere
By myself I am singing their song
that no one wants to hear

Many words, many dreams I've got to give
But in this racing world there is ni place for me
And when I leave today no memories remain...


Leave No Deed Undone
--------------------

From the moment to wkae up
you cannot feel free
There are so many things in this world
you can't see
Just don't keep on leaving
your dreams behind
Have the heart to see you'll get
trapped in your mind

It's like an impurity in your mind
Furtive ruin that
hails from behind
Get rid of the demon
that darkens your sun
Go on... go on...
leave no deed undone!

You don't really depend
on material plight
And the way you live...
it is simple not right
You just have to get rid
of your own demands
Fight against yourself
for a second chance

No escape
Every further step you'll ever make
Will drive you on to me
And I will set you free

Sometimes it's too easy
just to be scared
No-one promised
your life would be fair
There's always a reason for you to turn
Away... with me... leave no deed undone


Anyway
------

I awake... and I look...
Down at my sleeping face
From the cold...
Persuading melodies
Want me to join this...
Unreal dance
An unholy humming
That echoes and dies

Can I resist...
Be torn into laughter
And I can persist
Being torn into light
They want me to join this...
Unreal dance
That forces my mind
Just to follow thy will

Anyway...
Any way must lead out into me
Anyway I can't go on crawling
Anyway, I must get rid of it all...

Endless halls... dancing shades
Spinning round
Twisting their skinny limbs
Stench of doom I smell...
They want me to join this...
Unreal dance
And don't want to offer me...
Any further chance

Careworn... down torn...
Into the swirl of their senselessness...
Cosy emptiness...
It wants me to join this...
Unreal dance
Left alone... anywhere you go...
You'll be caught in your fear again


šbers Jahr (Over The Year)
--------------------------

Tracks in the snow lead past you
Clear frosty winds in the moonlight
Endless hours filled with glassy silence
You keep watch persistently in deepest night

Then the stillness is broken
Flows into sleepy, meagre wanting
The mist blows quietly
The world is at last full of light

Deep-green meadows, cool shady woods
Blossom under the benevolence of the sun
Ripening corn in swaying dances
Whisper their wisdom to the wind

Then the stillness is broken
Recently sunk, with this breath
The mist quietly rises
At last night steps onto the world

The tracks have returned
In the snow near the trees
The moon stands alone
In the cold night

There is a silence
A very deep peace
An almighty sleep
Life quietly loses itself
And waits for the new day


A Broken Whisper
----------------

Silence slowly comes to me...
embraces me so tight to keep me cold...
A thought that's drifting through my mind...
Stuggles to be free and wails alone...

Embraces me... so tight...
Struggles to... be free...

We turn to stone!
We don't find home!

Can you hear this broken whisper?
Can you hear it how it calls?
We turn to stone!
We don't find home!


That's all... I think. The best way to get a right  impression is surely to meet
your local record dealer and get a "hear of it"...
