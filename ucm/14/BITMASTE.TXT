Some first words... because bITmASTER don't checked that the UCM is published in
english  language today he  answered all questions in german... but remember, he
left the active part of  the Atari scene over 3 years ago and my  contact to him
broke down even a bit earlier... So I sat down and -tried- to  translate all the
stuff he wrote down to english, because there are some informations given who're
really interesting...

                  INTERVIEW WITH: bITmaSTER of THE CHAOS ENGINE

================================================================================



I. General Questions


ÛUCM:       We make  no exceptions and torture you, as usual, with the boring and
Û           'thousand times asked before'-stuff Mr. Pink is so in love with...
Û           First  tell  us  a little  bit of  your  history. How  did  you start
Û           computing and what groups you were in?

ÒbITmaSTER: My first "computer" was a machine with Germanium transistors, magnet-
Ò           coil and punchcard. But this  thing doesn't  stand at my  home but in
Ò           the rooms of a computer-club (this was around 1980/81).
Ò           Because I wasn't interested to go 3 km for just one time of coding, I
Ò           developped a Z80 computer system  together with a  friend. We did all
Ò           things by ourselves: bussystem, switchplans, platines, software... At
Ò           the end there was running CP/M.
Ò           Finally it was a  platine for a ZX Spectrum imitation (except Z80/RAM
Ò           only 74xxx chips). And so we were  finally able  to play  some games.
Ò           (yes, Knightlore is genious!)
Ò           In the middle of 1989  I got around 1000 DM (changed 1:5 - about 5000
Ò           east  german  marks!). And now I had to  decide if I  have to  get an
Ò           Amiga or Atari...
Ò           My first demo, that I ever saw, was the  B.I.G. Demo! I found it very
Ò           exciting (music, grafix  effects) and  the most  interesting question
Ò           was how they managed it to display the low border.
Ò           Through the  demo swapping I got  in contact   with THE BYTE and so I
Ò           decided to work together with him in BLUE SOFTWARE.
Ò           At  a party in  Dresden (DRESDEN  CODING  CONVENTION 1993) there  was
Ò           build an  alliance of  several german  groups (THE CRYSTAL CORPS) but
Ò           this one doesn't existed very long so that we (BLUE SOFTWARE) decided
Ò           to join THE CHAOS ENGINE.
Ò           Today THE CHAOS ENGINE actually doesn't exist anymore.


ÛUCM:       What are your jobs in the group?

ÒbITmaSTER: hacking, coding


ÛUCM:       The crowd maybe really bored now but who cares? How old are you?

ÒbITmaSTER: 2^n+1, for n there exists just one sensefull value. Just a small tip:
Ò           n is ofcourse positive! ;-)


ÛUCM:       What is your current equipment?

ÒbITmaSTER: 133 Mhz Pentium (for  surfing and PSX coding), except this  there are
Ò           standing around the following machines:
Ò           - Z80 selfmade computer
Ò           - ZX Spectrum imitation
Ò           - Atari ST
Ò           - Atari Falcon
Ò           - Atari Jaguar
Ò           - Acorn RiscPC (StrongARM)
Ò           - Playstation


ÛUCM:       What is your fave game for the ST/FALCON?

ÒbITmaSTER: ST: Xenon, Wizball - Falcon: Ishar


ÛUCM:       What is your fave demo for ST/FALCON?

ÒbITmaSTER: I don't know right, there are so many really good demos (B.I.G. demo,
Ò           UNION demo, CUDDLY demos, DARKSIDE OF THE SPOON and so on)


ÛUCM:       What interests do you have apart from computing?
Û           Fave music for example.

ÒbITmaSTER: internet, games (RPG, adventures), synthetic music (soundchip, Mods),
Ò           electronic/hardware, stock exchange/shares, ...this all has something
Ò           to do with computers... ugh...
Ò           except Computers:
Ò           sleep in
Ò           doing nothing
Ò           chinese food
Ò           reading


ÛUCM:       Please  tell us  your point  of view about  the future  of the Atari-
Û           scene.

ÒbITmaSTER: There is no future (not only for Atari), nothing is selfmade anymore,
Ò           only consuming...



II. Going deeper


ÛUCM:       So you told me once before you are working on the  Playstation today.
Û           Please tell me more about it (projects, plans, etc...)

ÒbITmaSTER: At the  moment I'm  working on an  Atari-Soundchip-Music-Demo for the
Ò           PSX. This  is about  90% finished, but, as  always, there is  still a
Ò           lack of grafix and  design. For my  first version the grafician said:
Ò           "This is shit!". And this guy is right, but I don't got better things
Ò           up to now...
Ò           Ofcourse I have  some more  projects but  I don't want  to talk about
Ò           unlayed eggs.


ÛUCM:       Why have you joined  the Acorn-scene  some years ago? Were there any
Û           special reasons?

ÒbITmaSTER: The Acorn RiscPC is a genious  computer. He has the best Risc chip of
Ò           the world and a great OS.


ÛUCM:       Can you tell us a little bit more about this scene? Are there
Û           many Democrews and freaks in general?


ÒbITmaSTER: In Germany there was never a real scene, even if some good demos were
Ò           released with the time.
Ò           Acorn  finally died  too, just a  few weeks  ago the  follow up model
Ò           RiscPC 2 was  stopped. There are now some tries to rescue it but this
Ò           situation we already know from the Atari.


ÛUCM:       Have you still contact to all the other freaks from TCE? As far as
Û           I know they are all dead and only THE BYTE releases some demo CD
Û           ROM from time to time.

ÒbITmaSTER: Yes, we're all dead.


ÛUCM:       Do you see yourself still as a member of TCE and if yes, have you any
Û           plans to do anything on Atari systems again?

ÒbITmaSTER: I don't want do anything for Atari again.


ÛUCM:       Flashback. You are  little child again and you are supposed  to buy a
Û           computer... would you choose Atari again?

ÒbITmaSTER: Ofcourse, because  on no other  system there  were so many  hardware-
Ò           frontiers  overcome as  on the Atari (fullscreen, syncscroller, digi-
Ò           sound...)


ÛUCM:       The best memory you have from your life in the Atari-scene?
Û           (best party, etc...)

ÒbITmaSTER: It was the moment as I checked how the synscrolling runs.


ÛUCM:       VR-SECTION. DUNGEON MASTER. You  are  one  of  the four characters in
Û           Dungeon Master... which  one would  you choose (Magician, Warrior...)
Û           and what  guys from the Atari scene would you choose to complete your
Û           party?

ÒbITmaSTER: I would be the Magician. I would  chose the people who made the first
Ò           demos on the ST.
