                        MILLIWAYS II - PARTY REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                       

From the 4th to the 6th of December .tSCc. invites some friends and  the friends
of the friends to issue 2 of the MILLIWAYS convention.
Sooner  or very later MC LASER, SCY & DYNACORE / .tSCc., SAGE / ESCAPE, CREATURE
XL / H.A.R. and MAD BUTSCHER / FOUNDATION TWO arrived in Bellheim.

After the exchange of news everyone starts working. MC LASER and a friend of him
(ex-member of the GERMS (R.I.P.)) did some music with Cubase.
CREATURE XL made his first experiments with the Falcon assembler.
MAD BUTSCHER began to  code his  next 8 Bit  game, and  SCY and DYNACORE  hacked
something in Perl under Linux.

On Saturday  QUESTOR / INTER arrived and starts watching some  PC games together
with the Linux  crew. MC LASER showed us DOOM for the Falcon from a French coder
which he downloaded from the net, and we started to discuss if a very  slow DOOM
is better  than nothing  or a lame toy only. I think its  a cool demo  and maybe
someday  they  optimise  the  code  to  the  limit, that you could play  it in a
suitable performance.
Cool without a question is the Godboy version of ZELDA.
SAGE told  us that  the Java compiler is now  available  for the  ST/Falcon, but
without the  graphic library and very slow, but I think we should keep an eye on
it, maybe there will be an usable version in the future.

Also cool is a demo of the MAD TEAM for the 8 Bit ATARI from 1997 which includes
Bill Gates, but  unfortunately  there was no 8 Bit with a 256 KB or  more memory 
expansion.
In the night from the 5th to the 6th of December a local television channel made
a very big computer night to celebrate the 15th birthday of the  computer corner
of the channel. ATARI was mentioned too.
Ali Gaukassian, the  infamous puppet  of the German ATARI magazine had 3 minutes
to make some  advertisement for  the Milan. Well you  could hate  Ali or  try to
ignore him, but he did his job well.
Besides this historical moment there were some cool misunderstandings during the
live report, so we had great fun. 
On Sunday it was  time to leave, with  some minor car problems and tired we left
Bellheim.
Next time we and a lot more people will meet each other in Dresden at eastern to
celebrate the Error Line 99 convention.
