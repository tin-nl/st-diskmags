{*f1REVIEW OF 1998{*f0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1998 is nearly over  and I think it's time to look back to the highs and lows of
this year for the Atari scene. I must admit that all the following points are my
very private views and meanings and they don't even stand for the POETS OF DECAY
or other people involved in the UCM at all.

ó...highs...ð

At one point  1998 was very good  for the Atarians, if you had  enough money and
time it was a year, stuffed  with parties and I mean real parties, not the usual
small and  more local events  with just  1o visitors. A small  drawback  in this
point is the  problem that there was NO real Atari dominated  party held in this
year anymore... The most  important parties for the  whole european  Atari scene
where (without any doubt), the ñINTERJAMð, the ñALTERNATIVEð and the ñQUAST Partyð.
On those parties  also a lot of releases which were somekind of state-of-the-art
were released and a real international bunch of freax was meeting together.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is there any question? óDEAD HACKERS SOCIETYð kicked butt this  year! They've done
the most  demo releases  for Falcon. About ten  big (msx) demos and a  few small
releases were done by them, is  there anyone who can compete? I  think not if we
take a look on the quality. Anyway, there is a band  in their footsteps and with
two  fulltime demos and some  other hi-quality intros they're real  competitors,
you know them all, the óMYSTIC BYTESð from Poland...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it a high or maybe  more a hype?! After the fake mania in the first months of
this  year  another kind  of "demo" entered the  stage: ò128b introsð! After first
actions last year the demoscene was taken over by the intention to  release some
effects in just 128 Bytes! So we have more than 2o releases so far and even from
Yugoslavia there was  coming an intro! Ok, there  is a lot of  crap around but a
few ones were really impressive and I think it's just a question of  time to see
the first 128b competition on an Atari related party!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blablablabla... propaganda! Another  high in  my eyes is the  little war (or so)
between  òMAGGIEð and òUNDERCOVERð  because it forced the people  behind the  single
magazines to  go on much harder. Errr? At least one team made steps  with seven-
miles-boots, aaarg! It's òUNDERCOVERð! With 2 FULL issues since  the latest MAGGIE
release... so where the hell is the competition, where is the contestant?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I call  it a high? As ST user I think so... even if  the ò"Resurrection"ð demo
seems still to be  far away the ST scene slowly came back to life within 1998. I
can't remember right but I think since 1995 or so the bunch of releases is a bit
growing again. No! I don't mean compact disx and so on, but there were some nice
intros and demos  released within  this year that  bound the  ST users  on their
machines again. Ok, not  as much as  in former times  but still  enough and of a
better quality at all, which is worth to  switch the machine  on. Hell, with all
the  delayed demos  together it would be much better but there is a silverstripe
on the horizon...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...lows...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even if  ñTOMMYð of óAVENAð has left the  active Atari scene a while  ago his sudden
death was a big hit for a lot of people. He was one of the best musicians on the
Atari platform ever, his  great soundtracks gave a special feeling  to the prods
where they were included.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without any doubt the  biggest hit into  the stomach  of the Atari scene was the
surprising  quit of ñTATð, one of the last master coders on  Falcon. Not only that
his quit will  hide one of the most promising demos, the ò"BINLINER"ð demo forever
from the  eyes of the  Falcon demo  watchers, no, he  caused a  lot of  negative
atmosphere in the scene too, because several people who worked together with him
have lost a lot of motivation too...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another  frustrating point  was the fact  that a lot  of new  demos for  ST were
announced but not released. With the time the bunch of announced demos growed up
to about 1o different and promising releases but with the  time it seems as they
are all lost on several harddisks of demotivated coders... Here comes the topten
of them... maybe they will fill up another article of the kind "Demos That Never
Saw The Light Of Day - Part 345"

Resurrection - by the óST KNIGHTSð and ó.tSCc.ð, maybe one of the most promising and
               longest delayed demos of the  last years... as the latest rumours
               say it will never see the light because both involved coders have
               stopped their work on it...

{*i resurr2.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

Modulation 2 - óCHECKPOINTð announced it since long time but as it seems ñDEFJAMð is
               infected by the 128byte virus and not interested in finishing it.
               Latest rumours telling that it will see the light in spring 1999.
Do Things... - What things  óCREAMð are doing  is very mystical, delayed about 1/2
               year now (was  announced at  first to  be released  in  the first
               quarter of 1998)
Nostalgic... - ñLEONARDð seems to be lost in a nostalgic mood... even if  a lot of
               people joined this project, nothing heard for long time now, just
               the  latest rumour  says: release date will be  Xmas 98... I will
               only believe my eyes!
Silent Breaker is the name of óCOBRAð's long announced  demo which  is lost in the
               dark and will  perhaps never  see the light, because the band has
               splitted up...
Phototro       óHEMOROIDSð' last ST demo, done for  the òPLACE TO BE PARTYð in 1995,
               was announced to be finally released this year... eehhh...
Breath         The long awaited  first step of the óMYSTIC BYTESð ST on the ST, it
               should be  released  long time ago  but was postponned  again and
               again... it was announced for November'98, the months  passed but
               nothing happened... latest rumours say it will come spring 1999.
Japmo          Latest rumours say that ñHYLSTð of  óCEREBRAL VORTEXð has  started to
               work on this  mega project  again, but do you  really believe one
               single coder can fill up 5 disx (!) with effects!?
(Checkpoint)   another demo in work, since years  now... I saw previews, but the
               rest is a bunch of cruel rumours.
(Supremacy)    nothing  heard since they  announced a new  STE dentro... perhaps
               because the lack of coders?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apropos demos... with  the time the  Atari scene changed  to some kind of party-
only-scene, except some very small exceptions no one releases some stuff besides
the parties anymore, grmpf... so the time between  the single events  isn't very
stuffed  with releases and esp. the winter, in former times used  for coding all
the day, seems to be used in another way by the current Atari scene.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Errr. Sure, some people have now the chance to kick me again, but 1998 has shown
it to  the world, the  polish scene was totally  overrated and overhyped! Ok, in
the last two years it seemed  that they can blow  fresh wind into  the scene but
now, after the "big crash" there are is just one big team left to feed the hype,
the ñMYSTIC BYTESð. Except some small  actions by the  splitted ñCOBRA/WHELPZð posse
and ñPRESTIGEð isn't much left. The rest  of the  polish scene seems to be  turned
to dust, teams  like ñSYNTAXð or ñCONFUSIONSð, high rated for their productions, are
lost in space, others names like ñLUZAK TEAMð or ñPANDEMONIUMð slowly fading away...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a blinking eye I can now talk about this fact now: fake demos! Already done
since years now 1998 brought a bunch of fake releases, a lot of them wasn't even
worth the  diskspace. A few were nice and good for  a laugh, but a  lot of stuff
was released  which activated at least my  vomit center! It seems as this is now
history, anyway, for me it was one of  the deepest points in 1998, as Atari guys
just ruled competitions with fake demos... the Atarians may have looked pathetic
in the eyes of other freax. I hope the fake mania is over now!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's it for 1998... it's time to face 1999, the  last year of  this millenium!
And I really  hope the highlights  will go on with the  coming year. Even if the
Atari scene  shrinks from  month to month, the  activists who are  left have the
power to rock untill the next millenium!
