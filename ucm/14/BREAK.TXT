This is the  latest games release by PARANOIA in 1998 and one of the productions
the people were really waiting for. It was announced as a so called "scene game"
and so it's understandable that the freax were going mad about it.

As the title says the game is  a breaker game, but what the  hell has breakdance
to do with the Atari scene? Hm, I think to answer this question I have to take a
closer look to the game.

"BREAKDANCE" itself is another  STOS game, for STE (and maybe Falcon) only. It's
the  second  game  by PARANOIA and after the  mediocre "STETRIS" (check  out our
review of this game in this UCM at...
>--> STETRIS <--<                                                                   {*\STETRIS.TXT}
...I really  hoped for a game which can bring  the -break-through of  this young
german label because they belong to the most promising youngsters at the moment.

Back to the  question what breakdance has to  do with the scene, hmm... nothing,
as long as  no scener isn't breaking at all. But  they're doing  it, at least in
this game! "What?!" I can hear your question... "A breakdance game?!".
Hum, the same goes for  me after I heard the first  time about  it, why I really
had no idea how you can make a game out of a dancing style.
So there is no other to check it out with this game.

After an intro which also gives  the information that this game is running under
the LUNATIC ASYLUM label too, the main screen comes up, displaying six people of
the scene, to be precise, Llama of .tSCc., Paranoid of Paranoia, Sage of Escape,
Grey of The Mystic Bytes, Mike of Stax and last but not least 5o5 of Checkpoint.

Those  are your heroes in this  game, choose one (or up to six for  six players)
and search for your destiny... The game principe is rather simple.
Your hero has to repeat the moves a woman, stupidly called Miss Atari, shows you
on the  screen... erm... and  that's it! It's  something like a memory game, the
same you can buy with colours or sounds for your kids in every toy shop...
Ok, at the  first time  it may be a bit funny to see the single people moving on
the  screen, but the animations aren't very brainblasting  and if  you have seen
any  move of your little  hero the motivation to  restart this game  and play it
again tendends to zero.
The rules are too simple to bound you for  longer time on the  machine. At first
the  woman shows  you one  move, you  have to repeat, she adds one, you  have to
repeat all moves again  and so on. If  you repeat  one in the false order you're
out of the game...

And that's all... ok, it's a multiplayer game, but the word multiplayer is a bit
wrong here, esp. if you take the 6 players option too serious. Up to six players
can play, but  as I checked out the second keyboard player is kicked out  if you
start the game. This happened in the competitive and the normal mode as well, so
it  seems  more to  be a 5 players  game. But for  me, as lonely  Atarian in the
surroundings it doesn't matter.
The Pad control works fine, as the joystick and keyboard (except the second one)
as well.
There isn't any clue needed to check up the game, it's easy to understand.

Ok, a small  look to the technics. The grafix  aren't brainblasting at  all, the
animations are nice  looking but don't kick ass really, maybe because  there are
very big ani steps... but eh, it's breakdance =)  The painted sceners look funny
at the first look  and if you know them you can even recognize them  as the ones
they should be.
The other grafix, hem, not  the ones I like very much, esp. I saw  again the too
much used Paranoia logo and I really want to see a new one in the next prod!

The sound isn't on the STE level at all, cruel 14 Khz on a 8MHz STE... yerk!
Therefore esp. the intro module of MC Laser of .tSCc. is a really nice one, very
atmospheric with some nice noises and samples. The ingame music isn't as good as
the intro music, uses  some very  old and boring  samples, isn't all  other than
state of the art.
Luckily the game offers the possibility to change the music in the game and also
to include other musix as well.

So what's left of the -ultimate- scene game?! Check out my...

Conclusion: Sorry, but I have to say that the games makes fun for maybe 1o mins,
            up to  the point that you have checked out all moves of the included
            guys. After this it gets boring, boring as hell. Ok, there  are some
            good points, like the (nearly) well working controls. The grafix are
            ok too  but they don't feed the hype. The intro  music is great, but
            therefore  the ingame msx don't hold this  standard. But what is the
            best music worth if the replay rate is shit, at least on STE. Here I
            really don't see the need of the STE at all. But anyway, the biggest
            drawback is the too simple game principe... some  memory stuff! Wow!
            Very amazing! Sorry, but  I will surely never start this game again,
            it's for pure fans only. Even those gimmicks as the guest appearance
            of TAT makes it not funnier...
