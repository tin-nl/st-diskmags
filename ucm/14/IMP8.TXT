                                IMParty 8000
                          December 31 - January 3

                                  Welcome!

   IMParty is back, new and improved with Solaris-look-alike version
   number!
   For the first time in IMP history, we are changing the house where it
   will be arranged. The old house was getting a bit tight on space and
   high on rent. This new place features a leased internetline and
   showers (!).

   There are buses and trains going to Gr„ngesberg, and Dalairport is
   about one hour away. Going by car is quite simple, and the maps below
   should give you enough informations to find the way quite easily.
