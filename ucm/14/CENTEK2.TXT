                                  official review

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, it's the  long-awaited Falcon hardware-accelerator from the French hardware
wizzards and deadline-ignoring-folk called òCENTEKð! And we reviewed it for you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CenTurbo2 (CT2) was  to be the  ultimate  Falcon accelerator. Offering  very
fast  TT-RAM memory, a new  50MHz 68030 CPU as well as accelerating  the DSP and
the VIDEL. There  was and is a big hype around the whole  CT2. It was claimed to
be as fast as the ñAFTERBURNER040ð and also more compatible and cheaper.

I (earx) wanted to  get one straight away in May this year. The only problem was
that  CENTEK delayed  this project endlessly. Well... Maybe  not that  long, but
only early September I could buy one.

The unit  cost me 750 guilders (= 670 DM or œ240). I  felt a bit  insecure about
the  whole thing at first. This much money for a compact board with  only a tiny
installationguide and a disk? The fitting wasn't even included in the price!
And please note that neither an FPU or a SIMM for the TT-RAM are supplied!

So, what do you get exactly?

óCenTurbo2 òrev. Að:

ñ* CenTurbo2 board
  The  compact  red  board looks  well  designed  and solid  and fits  into  the
  Falcon030's  expansionslot. It contains one  EDO SIMM socket for  a 16 or 32MB
  SIMM, an  FPU-socket, a  new COMBEL, a  32-bit  wide  throughport  for  future
  extensions, some clockcrystals (50MHz for CPU/FPU/DSP and 36MHz for VIDEL) and
  ofcourse a brandnew 50MHz 68030.
ò* the CenTurbo2 modul
  This is a tiny  additional board that contains some chips. I have no clue what
  they could be for. But I know the CenTurbo2 contains a DMApatch. This patch is
  essential  if the IDE  or SCSI transferrate  rises above  500KB/s. It  is only
  contained in  the C-LAB falcons as standard, but with the CT2 you also get one
  for free.
ó* an installationguide (in English) counting 8 pages
  This contains all information about the things you have to cut and solder.
  Nothing much else is in here, except a little resistor taped to a page.
ñ* a plug with 12 wires
  This fits  onto a connector  on the CT2 board and is used to connect the board
  with other circuits in the Falcon.
ò* a disk with various software and documentation
  There is software to update  the flashEPROM of the  CT2, to control  the NVRAM
  settings  in your Falcon, to enhance the screenresolution as  well as numerous
  benchmarking programmes.
  The  documentation  varies  from a  compatibility list, to  information  about
  clockticks, memory-accesses, etc. A quite extensive amount of information.
ó* a switch for turning the CT2 off and on
ñ* a CENTEK sticker
ò* a CENTEK card

As you might  have figured, the fitting of  this board is no  easy task. It fits
into the extension port easily, but from then on it is a horrific job.
Especially  cutting  pins on  chips and  tinning them can be  nervewrecking. And
trust me.. There  is alot of this  work involved! If you are not sure about your
soldering talents, ñPLEASE LET SOMEONE ELSE FIT ITð for you!

It's possible  to let CENTEK themselves fit  it at a price of  400FF (=120 DM or
œ 40) and this excludes  the postage and packing. Yes, gentlemen.. You gotta pay
to play! If you  screw up yourself, you  have no garantee your Falcon  will ever
work again, so it's  a wise idea  to let CENTEK fit it. Also.. They  can be held
responsible for screwing up and you can claim a new Falcon motherboard.

I was  unwise, I had it installed by a friend. But it was worth the gamble. In a
few hours  the CT2 was fitted and my Falcon was turbocharged! I couldn't believe
my eyes! My falcon booted faster, loaded faster, worked faster! Wow!
And not just a bit, but an enormous amount!

Please  note that  I had bought  a 16MB EDO SIMM and  this was  installed on the
board. This  makes quite a difference as the TOS 4 can be loaded into the TT-RAM
and  that helps  a lot! Without  this  memory, the  performance is  considerably
lower!

I also noticed there was a special bootprogram that let you select various OSses
such as  DOLMEN, the old TOS 4 from ROM and the  FASTRAM TOS (misguidingly named
TOS 7! HAHA!). It also offers a new harddisk driver, boot videosettings and AUTO
folder manager. And all this in the ROM! Fast and efficient!

On the downside.. my Falcon wasn't exactly the same even when the CT2 was turned
off. Some  demos  and  games  simply refused  to work  correctly. No wonder: the
original falcon CPU  can never be turned on again and everything is still routed
over the CT2 board!

Also, when the  CT2 is on, games and demos tend  to cause serious  problems with
the  VIDEL. Using  the  ñexternal VIDEL-clockð now  results  in a ó36MHzð  frequency
instead of the 32MHz frequency, causing the screen to be hopelessly distorted!
CENTEK claim  this 36MHz clock can  be turned into 32MHz  again by  selecting an
option  in the  bootprogram. I tried this dozens  of times, but still  it didn't
work!

Furthermore  there are some  problems with the òBLITTERð. This thing ofcourse does
NOT work with TT-RAM. When NVDI or MAGIC aren't installed  the blitter is always
turned on  and loads of  shit is displayed on  screen in the  desktop! Even when
NVDI is installed  games can  turn the blitter back on after having  exitted and
you need to turn the blitter off again.

Luckily, I  discovered  that  the  utility CENTSCREEN  can be  used to  keep the
blitter  turned off. BUT! This wasn't noted in CENTEK's  documentation! But this
trick  only works  with NVDI or MAGIC again. So  I think  NVDI is an  unmissable
addition to your setup!

To my suprise, the DSP was  not even a problem. Eventhough it is accelerated and
the Falcon  has always been very  sensitive to changes  in the DSP's  clock. But
most programs  work fine. Even most games and demos give good sound. I couldn't
hear crackling in the output. It still is crystalclear.

So.. The CT2 is  fast, but there  is a pricetag connected to it, and  that's not
all. There  are some  serious consequences  to fitting  the CT2. To give a  more
clear image, I'll some the highs and lows up right here...

                                  +++ ñHIGHSð +++

ñ+ Horribly FAST!
  It takes out every other accelerator. Maybe the Afterburner offered this speed
  as well, but this card isn't produced anymore and was much more expensive!
ò+ TT-RAM on the board is a great improvement.
  For once, more than 14MB in your Falcon!
ó+ Great flashEPROM with bootprogram.
  This  offers  a  configurable  harddiskdriver, videosettings, OS-selection, as
  well as a ability to upgrade free of cost.
ñ+ Good compatibility.
  Not the most compatible, but for  this amount of  speed it's  good. Especially
  the DSP part. Also the SCSI and the IDE interfaces work without any problems.
ò+ Includes DMApatch.
  Fixes serious harddisk problems for older Falcons.
ó+ Loads of software and information.
  Very  complete bunch  of utilities  and almost  everything you  wanted to know
  about the CT2 is included in ASCII form.
ñ+ FAST IDE interface.
  The IDE interface  can now reach speeds up to 8.5 MB/s. This only works with a
  new  IDE  drive, though. The  old  65 MB  or  84 MB  models  surely  won't  be
  accelerated.

                                  --- ñLOWSð ---

ñ- Horribly EXPENSIVE!
  It might  seem reasonably priced, but  loads of things  that should  have been
  standard aren't included (FPU, EDO SIMM).
ò- Really hard to fit!
  And this also costs a buckets of money extra if you leave it to CENTEK.
ó- Falcon will never be the same.
  There can be  problems with compatibility in games and demos even with the CT2
  turned off!
ñ- Problems with VIDEL.
  Many  games and  demos show  wrong  resolutions. CENTEK  claim there  is a way
  around this, but after all I tried I still had no success.
ò- Problems with the BLITTER.
  This can be solved with NVDI and CENTSCREEN, but it still is annoying.
ó- The CT2 board doesn't fit 100% the right way.
  All metal casing needs to be removed. Also, a piece of the IDE harddisk-holder
  has to be cut off.
ñ- Extra coolingfan!
  The unit requires an extra coolingfan! Stupid and noisy. And why was this CPU-
  fan required anyway? A 50MHz 030 should work perfectly without one I thought..
  But no.. Underneath that cooler was a ñ33MHz RATEDð model!
  Simply overclock the shit and put a fan on it! òSHAME ON YOU CENTEK!
ò- Little distortion in screen when cachebursts occur.
  When writing  from the  TT-RAM to the ST-RAM, the VIDEL is forced  to wait and
  can't put  the pixels on  screen. Luckily this only happens in the desktop and
  not in games or demos.

                                >>> ñBENCHMARKSð <<<

Yes, I might have said the CT2 to be fast, but exactly how fast is it? I decided
NOT to include  normal ratings from official benchmarking programs, because they
are mostly not representative of the complete system performance.

òGEM applications:

GEM applications  always support TT-RAM. This is why the CenTurbo2 has such high
performance in this area. When TOS is loaded into TT-RAM it, the desktop behaves
over 3 times as fast. The scrolling is one hell of a smooth afair!
Even in 640*400 Truecolor, the scrollspeed is still acceptable.

Assembling with DEVPAC 3.1 is 3-5 times faster. A complete 10000 line-sourcecode
with  many INCLUDES and INCBINs now assembled in 9  seconds instead  of 30! In a
more intensive  resolution it  still took 9 seconds, whilst the  standard Falcon
slowed down to 44 seconds!

This immediately  shows off how  effective  TT-RAM really is. It is fully 32-bit
and supports the cachebursts off the 68030 at full speed. Also, it is unhampered
by the  VIDEL and SDMA. So it is available 100% of the time exclusively  for the
IDE and CPU!

The CT2  without TT-RAM is  like driving  over a speedway  with  your  gramdma's
bicycle. You  need this stuff! Go  kick some PC owners! Tell them they need DIMM
right now, because EDO SIMMs are outdated and rip them off!

Applications  using the DSP are also faster. But the DSP is only 55% faster than
before, so the  speedincrease is not so dramatical. Loading JPEG images with the
brainstorm decoder is indeed smoother, but not twice as fast. Also, the DSP MPEG
player and fractal programs get a healthy speedboost.

óGames and demos:

These don't  always support TT-RAM. Also, the CT2 has heavy resolution problems!
When games  and demos do work, they can be expected to be twice as fast when 3d-
graphics are used. When they support TT-RAM, it really gets nice :) 3 or 4 times
as fast graphics is no exception.

Games  with  2d-graphics  mostly  operate  at  a fixed  framerate  and  won't be
accelerated at all. Maybe only the startup or loading will be accelerated.
3d-games however, will allways be faster!

For demos  it's mostly  the same. Falcon  demos don't use  sprite based graphics
much, so they will fly all over your screen. A really good trend is the usage of
25MHz VIDEL frequencies which the CT2 has no problem with. The newest demos also
support TT-RAM! So get ready to rock!

Still, I gotta  say that GEM applications are mostly the things that benefit the
most from the  CT2. Many demos use DSP as well and this part of the falcon isn't
that much faster.. Most GEM programs don't use the DSP, and since the memory and
CPU are that  much faster, it becomes clear why GEM-programs suddenly  behave as
they should have in the first place :)

                               <<< ñFINAL THOUGHTð >>>

           (To use the words of that lousy hypocrite Jerry Springer.)

I want to give  some words of caution to everyone with a fine working Falcon. If
you have no need for acceleration in ñGEM programsð and you play demos and games
a lot, please  do think twice  about fitting this. Especially since  your Falcon
will be  irriversably changed after fitting and there are too many problems with
demo/game resolutions!

Also, I think  it's clear that  the CT2 is too  expensive for what it  offers as
standard. For ó670DMð I would have expected at least some an  EDO SIMM and fitting
as included. Maybe  a standard FPU would have been a good thing  as well. CENTEK
give  an explanation  for the  high price: They  will put  the profits  into the
development of the òPHENIXð.

If you  want  to  sign up as  a software developer  for the  forthcoming  PHENIX
system, you  get 50% off the retailprice of the CT2. Now that's alot better. You
might even call it cheap. 340DM is a low price for this kind of equipment.

So  if  you're  someone  who  believes  in the  PHENIX  and  you  use  many  GEM
applications  the CT2 can be a great addition to your system. The speed increase
is  enormous and I   never expected to see the Falcon to work at  this speed. It
feels groovy!

So  far, the CT2 is  doing great. CENTEK's  stocks have  been  sold out  2 times
already and  if you ask me, this will happen  once or twice  more. Still I think
CENTEK  should make the unit less expensive and fix the damn VIDEL problem! This
is annoying to say the least!

If this  will happen, the  future for the  CenTurbo2 will  look very  bright. It
could withstand even the competition from the ñTEMPESTð coldfire accelerator. (and
we still have to see exactly how hard that unit is to fit and what compatibility
problems it brings :))
