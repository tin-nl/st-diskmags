Do you remember óBITWA MORSKAð? No? It was reviewed in an older issue  of the UCM.
Now I got the second part... running only on STE and so I really hopped for some
STE using actions.
The principe of  the game should be clear, everyone of you surely knows the game
ñ"Battle Ships"ð... just  search and  destroy the enemy ships  on a  playfield and
hide  your  own  as good as  possible against his  attacks... it's  some kind of
strategic and thinking game...

After loading  the game a  green (ugly green!) screen popped  up on my  monitor,
displaying a scanned battle ship (is it the polish marine?! =) ...)

{*i bitwa1.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

Hum... nothing more, silence... I thought "Where is the sound, music, whatever?"
I turned on the volume control but nothing happened... so why using an STE only?
Don't know, maybe the game itself features some stuff? We'll see...

Because there  was no instruction  given on the screen I just smashed  space and
the first problem for me accured: polish language! Aarg!
There was  standing the following thing  on my screen: "Czy mam wczytac zapisana
gre (T/N)?".... so what do you think? I really don't know... if I have to insert
a coin, go pissing in a corner or just licking some ice?! Eh...
I tried -T-...

Whop! A map  appeared on  the screen... with a strange  chip noise... again some
polish  command is  displayed on the screen, fuck! On the  screen you  can see a
crosshair which you can move with the mouse, and a lot of blinking points.
Seems to be the ocean with some islands and marine bases, eh?
Maybe I have to search  my starting position? I clicked on every  blinking point
but nothing happened. Because I saw no possibility  to go on  I resetted  my STE
and started again...

After I reached the polish command line again I wisely kicked the -N- button and
the map appeared again on the screen... erm?
I klicked on a base  and hey! The game informs me that this base  belongs to the
"Komputer"... aha! I klicked another  base and there  I found a base  where some
actions could happen... urg...I klicked the false button...
Again... right button! Ups...

Another screen  appeared, showing the  battelfield and  giving some  polish info
again... sux! On the right there  is the animation window with to  canons, above
this a small logo of the game...
Ok, let me  check... it seems as I have to place my ships  now? I put 1o crosses
displaying my ships on the field and the game starts.
Yerk! The computer  don't hitted one! In the animation window the shots and some
kind of explosions were displayed as cruel animations.
The sound consists of strange noises, samples? I don't think so...

Erg... I don't hitted  just one ship... but the computer  catched my  first one,
and the second! Hug!
And so it goes on. For every hit I lost one shot and so I have even in the third
round lost 3 of my ten ships. Shit!
But I  checked out  that the computer acts not very intelligent, even if  he has
hitted one of my ships he doesn't searched  in its surroundings for  other ships
and shots around on the whole playfield.
Anyway my  chances standing  not very good as the  computer killed my fifth ship
because he can nearly shot as double shots as me.
Finally I have lost my marine base and the game goes over to the next...

Here I have to stop, sorry.
What's left? A  really sour  taste! This game isn't a STE game at all... again I
don't know what special features are needed to create such a simple game.
Ok, the  control over  the mouse is quite ok, the game principe  not bad but the
point that you can spread your 1o ships all over the  map makes it to  some kind
of russian  roulette, you can't play with  a strategic  thought, because bombing
around  a destroyed  ship brings nothing (in comparison  with the  same  game on
paper, as  we played it in the school...). So everything depends  on the luck to
be the first one who find the enemy ships.
Furthermore the technics of the game are all other than impressive... just a few
grafix changes were done  and just the map feature  included. The  grafix itself
are as simple as possible and the sound tortures your ears...
Let's come to my...

òConclusionð: óBITWA MORSKA 2ð is surely a  game which  could bound  the player  for
            some time on the machine, but  more because  of the polish  language
            than on the game principe. The whole thing looks so extremly old and
            outdated that I can't  believe to have a production of the year 1998
            running on my  machine! If  you like  games of this  kind, where you
            haven't any  real chance to  build up an own strategy and you have a
            big  rucksack fulfilled with luck on your back, just try it out some
            time, but don't kick me if you're suffering under this simple thing!
            You're warned!
