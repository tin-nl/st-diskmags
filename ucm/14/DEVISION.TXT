       CONCERT: DE/VISION - "10" / JENA (GERMANY) KASSABLANCA - 15.12.1998
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the 15.12.98 it was the time to join another concert of this german synth-pop
band who matched it to climb also the german top 1oo charts for the first time.
As the germans know esp. their video to  the song "Strange Affection" was played
many times  on the music channel VIVA 2 and was much more played  than the video
to their first single "We Fly... Tonight".

Anyway, I already  met another concert of them, nearly one and  a half year ago,
at the same  place. At that time the ticket cost 12 DM... today with 17,5o a bit
more... same band, same place, but now they're "majors".
I never thought to see them again in Jena because with the tour for their latest
album "Monosex" they  don't wanted  to play at such "small" places as  the Kassa
again (even if there is room for about 75o people as I think...).
They also rised the costs for  the tickets and at their tour in spring 1998 they
wanted to have 24 DM for one! Bla!

Ok... anyway, their  second tour 1998, to promote their best-of album "10", just
stopped in Jena again, I got a  ticket and was going  to this event  with my old
friend Eva again (as one and a half year ago).
As we arrived  at the party place we were wondering why no one stands before the
hall  and so we thought that it will not be so  stuffed as at their  last gig in
Jena. And  yep, we entered the hall and  there was still a lot  of room, filling
very  slowly. We stepped  to the cloakroom, seeing  a queue  of about  4o people
standing there... eh... good if you know someone at the checkout, hehe...

With about 2 kilo less weight (it was "a bit" cold  outside) we entered the hall
again and waited for the act... and waited, and waited...
About 21 o'clock the support act, called DAYS OF FATE, also a electro-synth-pop-
band from Dresden/Germany, entered the stage, trying to warm up the crowd. Their
music was  a melange made out of typical synth-pop structures and even technoing
beats... unfortunately  it wasn't very special and I  don't remember  one single
song from their gig...

After a long pause, around 1o PM the main act, DE/VISION entered the stage, with
a fourth guy this time, with guitar?! Eh.
Anyway, they  started their  set and to my shame I don't remember the first song
anymore. Anyway, their set was also dominated by  a lot of technoing sounds this
time, with breaks by the guy with the  guitar, strange. But  the crowd  liked it
and  jumped around  like hell, in  comparison with their  last gig, the hall was
really cooking over this time! Even the people in the last lines started to jump
and dance... amazing for a synth-pop-concert!

They played  mainly the  songs from their last  album, like "We Fly... Tonight",
ofcourse  "Strange Affection", "New Drug" (still their  best song on "Monosex"),
"Hear Me Calling" and "Back In My Life", also several songs  from their '96 work
"Fairyland", just like "I Regret", "Sweet Life" or "Bleed Me White"...
In the later part also songs like "Blue Moon" (...das Ende ist nah...) were also
played, not  to forget the classic song "Dinner Without Grace" and finally, as a
small bonus... their german song "Endlose Tr„ume" (one of their best ever!).

After one and a half  hour they left the stage... and what should  I say? A nice
concert, no question. The crowd consisted this time not only of blacks and goths
as the last time, even technotics you could find there and maybe this mix out of
people brought the crazy feeling into the hall, you really could call it a party
(still seldom for synth-pop-concerts).
After the  show the evening  goes on with normal  black oriented  disco... but I
left  the place, because  I had to  stood up very early in the  morning again...
furthermore  I had a  small headache of  the ultra loud soundsystem... even if I
was standing in the last lines, ugh...

Ok... to feed  the hype again, if you like this kind of music, maybe if you have
seen their  videos on  tv or you already bought an  album or single of them, you
can go without permission to one  of their gigs! It's still worth  the money and
as written above, no one is pissing on you anymore if you're coming not in black
clothes ;) ... this times are over...
