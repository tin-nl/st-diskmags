                                  Atari.Org
================================================================================

It's been a while  since we last released any information about the plans behind
Atari.Org. They were a brainstorming  kind of document that appeared in Maggie26
(am I allowed to use that word here? :)

Well - things  have become a little more defined now. So I'm going to explain to
those who are interested just what Atari.Org is and what it can offer you.

                                 Background
================================================================================

The Internet  domain name atari.org  remained "coming soon" for as  long as most
people care to remember. Torbjorn Ose (Lord Hackbear of Delta Force) simply  did
not have the time to use his domain name and turn it into anything useful.
In  early  1997 the Atari ST emulation  scene started  to  really  flourish, new
emulators (spearheaded by PaCifiST) managed to make your PC run a fair selection
of classic ST games and demos.
One of  the  support sites, the  Little Green Desktop, grew up  amoungst  all of
this. The site  was dedicated  to all things ST and as  well as hosting  a large
range of  menu disks (Automation  and Pompey) it also  become a central  meeting
place on the  web for ST emulation  enthusiasts many of who  were programmers of
old.  LGD  went from  strength to  strength serving  hundreds  of  thousands  of
visitors, admist  all of this  the atari.org  domain name was offered to the LGD
webmaster, Richard Davey.
The Internic  transfer was processed, the domain moved across to a server hosted
at the ISP  Richard worked  for and a  whole new project started  up. It  wasn't
about emulation, it wasn't about the current "scene".
It was about ALL things Atari.

                                  Pathfinder
================================================================================

One of the  core elements of atari.org was to be Pathfinder, a complete database
and search engine indexing as many Atari sites on the Internet as we could find.
We found a  lot! Due to hard work from several key people, Pathfinder  soon grew
into a large  and well indexed resource. At the time of writing it contains over
620 links covering everything from the 2600 to the Falcon and beyond.
There  are  still  some  areas  to  complete, but if your  site isn't  listed we
strongly recommend adding it in.

                                Gem was born
================================================================================

Having  Pathfinder was all well and good. But  we wanted  to offer so  much more
with  atari.org. In order  to do this  we required  a dedicated  server - so, we
built one.
In the true spirit of the Atari community, various people pulled their resources
together and posted bits of hardware off to an obscure address in England. 
Some months later after a hard drive and motherboard had flown over from Sweden,
a floppy  drive from Slovenia and other bits of hardware from across  the world,
gem was born.
Lovingly  bought to life, this server was built from the parts and dedication of
the Atari world. Running Linux as its primary O/S it sits happily in the network
room of  the  company Richard works for. Nicely protected by an  MGS UPS system,
redundant power supply and multi-homed network. The server was in place, setting
up was required.

                               Gem can offer you...
================================================================================

As it  stands  right  now  we  are  able  to  offer  you the following services,
completely  FREE of  charge. Our server was built out  of a love for  Atari, you
provide  the work  you do  and the time you invest into  your projects  out of a
similar love.
That is payment enough. For  as long  as you keep  supporting  Atari, we'll keep
supporting your server and Internet requirements for free.

                                 Sub-domains
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you currently  have your web site located at your ISP, or perhaps with a free
provider  such as  Geocities or Fortune City, then you  most likely  have a very
nasty looking address for your web site.
Wouldn't  it be so  much easier if you could just type  in http://you.atari.org/
and have visitors taken to your site?
Well that is what we offer. Infact over 200 sites use this already! 
You  can sign-up  for free  on our  web page and  there is  a detailed  FAQ file
telling you what can and can't be supported.

                               Email addresses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Would you like you@atari.org as an email address? No problem! We can offer you a
complete  pop3 email account  with  login  and  password, or (and  this  is more
popular) we can forward all email to your ISP or University automatically.
Eitherway you can use you@atari.org as your address. Email can be collected from
our server or  via the web with our GeMail service (works just like  Hotmail but
for atari.org mail only).

                                Mailing list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd  like to  create a mailing list about any  Atari related  topic, we can
help. We already  run several  mailing lists on the server  and new ones  can be
created with ease.
Full  archive  support, remote  administration (via  email  commands)  and  list
personalisation is available.

                              Free web hosting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fed-up with  all the banners Geocities slams onto your site? Then  move! We will
host your  web site, it'll have an address of yoursite.atari.org, you get a free
email account  with it, you can use our CGI scripts, you get FTP access and best
of all - there  are NO limits on disk space. Providing what you  upload is Atari
related in content.

                                 Principals
================================================================================

These are  just some of the services we already offer. New ones and new features
of the  web site  will be ready  soon and  announced  accordingly. But we always
maintain the same principal - it's for free.
We don't and  won't charge you, ever. There are no requirements to place buttons
or banners  on your  site (although we have some if you'd  like to!) and  for as
long as you support Atari, we'll support you.
