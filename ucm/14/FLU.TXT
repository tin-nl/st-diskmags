       ñFluð by òNew Beat Developmentsð (1998) ó[Falcon]ð Dreamhack release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------       

ñThomasð of  òNew Beat Developmentsð is not  only  known  for  developing  fantastic
jump'n run games like the yet unreleased óWillie`s adventuresð, but since óBlueð, he
is also known for killer 4ktros. This is his latest project.

óFluð starts with a  nice Flu logo  that looks  really excellent, followed  by the
words "4k by" and "new beat". The letters feature a  vast amount of colours (the
program  renders a little before it actually starts) and they are displayed on a
coloured background as well.

This is  followed by  a ñspiralð-tunnel in a lot of  colours and a  small ñnew beat
logo in the  lower right  corner. This tunnel looks a little like  the 2nd bonus
level  of ñTempest 2000ð on the Jag, instead of single dots it features lines that
are  getting larger  as they move to the outer screen, resulting in  a "zooming"
effect.
After this  we have a ñwaterð-like  surface which  simulates the surface  of water
when something drops in the water and  creates waves. Although the resolution is
rather low, this effect looks quite smooth as well.
Finally, under a large ñnew beatð logo, the viewer is being moved along a surface,
several  lines scrolling  at various  speeds to create a "moving by a landscape"
effect. The  texture looks  a bit "muddy", but the effect is smooth, even in the
slower scrolling zones.

ñThe endð is  presented in a distorting way, the ñThe Endð logo moves from the right
to the  left and is being  distorted in the left and right border  of the screen
and also mirrored on the lower part of the screen.
Additionally, some ñchipmusicð is being played all through the demo.

This is without  a doubt an excellent  4ktro. With the good looking font and the
chipmusic, òFluð beats any 4ktro yet in design lefthanded. 
Although the  music is not as  nice as in ò4orceð of óDHSð and  although it  doesn't
feature as  many mindblowing  FX as ò4orceð does, it still looks better as it just
doesn't look like 4k.
For me, this  is a demo that is equal to ò4orceð. It may be technically "inferior"
to it, but with  the nice looking  font and  the FX being displayed, it  has its
advantages that makes it step in one line with ò4orceð.
