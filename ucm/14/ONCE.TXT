Here it is, the  first real  lifesign of WOLFSHEIM since two years, if you don't

will see the light in the next weeks.

track list...

o1. Once In A Lifetime
o2. Heroin, She Said
o3. Love Is Strange
o4. Once In A Lifetime (extended)

Some words to the single songs.
- Once In A Lifetime ... is a nice synth pop song, mixed up  with elements of so
  called  modern dance  music, so there  aren't only  synth areas  and  straight
  melodies, no, breaks  coming up the speed changes and  so on... it  shows that
  WOLFSHEIM don't walking on the same place, even if they have  reached all what
  is possible in their history  and matched it step out of the dark underground,
  they don't standing still  or resting too  long on their  laurels. Furthermore
  they made a  step in a direction many german synth bands have  even no checked
  up so far. So with this song they're going a step in the direction  of the big
  mass of listeners, without leaving their home, the  melancholic synth music. I
  don't know what charts position they have reached  with this  song, I just saw
  the single in masses in every big super market... it's just a great song!
- Heroin, She Said ... is  one of the songs where the lyrics are  more important
  than the sound itself, and this one is really strange, at least for WOLFSHEIM.
  Breaks, strange  samples and  a weird  melody  making  this song  very hard to
  digestible. And I think  it's the thing they want to reach with it... the song
  is about a  girl who's lost in drugs and  doesn't check  that she's  going the
  wrong way...
- Love Is Strange ... is a strange song  at all, I don't like it! Dunno why, the
  melody remembers me to a child song my mother sang me to fall asleep... blurg!
- Once In A Lifetime ... the extended version isn't as good as the original edit
  and more or  less superfluous on this single, sorry. Don't  has the  drive and
  the feeling of  the original because the melody  was changed and  the song has
  much more breaks...
  
Short? Short, not  even 2o minutes, and  except the  title song  not very  mass-
compatible, good and  bad at once. Good because not every school boy/girl who is
depressed  of several reason  will buy  it and run around in black  clothes now,
bad because the other songs don't feature the typical WOLFSHEIM feeling...
But overall just the title song alone is it worth to buy this single!
