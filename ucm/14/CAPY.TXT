           ñCapyð by òYesCrewð (1998) ó[TT/Falcon/ST with Graphic card]ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have  an Atari that  can display ñ640 x 480ð in ò16 coloursð, you should give
this game  a try as òSWEð, the  main coder, said that the  game isn't  supposed to
contain any ñ68030ð-instructions and should therefore run on an ñ68000ð as well.
The group this game is mainly aimed at are the òTT-ð and òFalcon-ð owners though.

Capy is a mixture between ñSokobanð and ñOxydð - although it contains a few elements
more from ñSokobanð and a few less from ñOxydð.
Your main  task is to  roll a ball  into the  exit. To do so  however, there are
several other, secondary tasks, to complete.
In most cases, you need to ñpushð blocks into emtpy places to build a path to roll
on - A bit like in òChip's Challengeð on the Lynx.
Some  special  bonuses  are  spread throughout  some  levels, like óbonus-pointsð,
ó1-upsð or other extras.
An additional time limit demands you to hurry up each level.
To control your ball you can use  either the òkeysð or the òPowerPadð simultaneously
- The "balance  your  ball  on a small  edge along a  canyon"-aspect  of òOxydð is
therefore not present.

At each  time, you can  call up  a ñmenuð which allows saving  and loading  of the
game, but also to switch on/off òtracker-music, chipmusic, sound effectsð etc.
The difficulty  level of ñCapyð increases steadily of the  30 enclosed  levels and
there are no give-aways.

ñCapyð also  includes a  complete  level- and  world-editor, that  enables  you to
create  your own ñlevelsð and even to include your own ògraphicsð. With  this editor
you can create your very own special version of ñCapyð featuring your own ñgraphics
and a set of ñlevelsð.

So far, so good.
ñCapyð is well  programmed - it's  mainly òGFA-Basicð. On the óFalconð, you can hear a
good soundtrack  by òToodelooð, on the óTTð or optional on  the óFalconð you  can have
òYM2149ð chipmusic, but those are rather old tunes.
The òsound-effectsð are  chip-effects  as well and  they do  not sound  very nice,
although they don't interfere with the music. 
The graphics may look a bit "poor", but for a game like Capy, they're absolutely
adequate as the player doesn't get lost in details and can clearly identify each
and every aspect of the level he is supposed to play.
The òfontð is  nice, but  rather simple  as well. Like  mentioned  above, you  can
replace the graphics using the òworld-editorð anyway.

The 30 built-in  levels are  good and  make good usage of the design of the game
itself. 
The òworld-editorð is  unfortunately very confusive and it is a bit hard to design
your own  levels - especially  with the  very poor  documentation given with the
òworld-editorð. It's a bit  tough for òRGB-Falconð users, as they can  only play the
game  using  screen-enhancement  software. Luckily, ñCapyð  seems  to  be  cleanly
programmed, as  it supports VDI-resolutions - and therefore resolution-enhancers
of various kinds.

The  average  òFalconð-user  sees  the  possibilities  of  his  machine  a  little
unexploited  in  ñCapyð  except  for  Toodeloo's  ógt2ð-soundtrack, the òFalconð stays
unused.
For òTT-ðowners, the  situation  looks a little  different. There are  very little
games  like ñCapyð, that  run on  the  òTTð without  being a  óGEM-gameð running  in a
window.
Nevertheless, ñCapyð is  a  really good  game  for people  who  like a  game  that
requires  brains instead of a quick trigger finger. It may not look too hot, but
it is well programmed and is fun level by level.
