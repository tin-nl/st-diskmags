                      òTOMMY OF AVENA COMMITTED SUICIDE!ð
                      ---------------------------------
                                        
One time when I was on  IRC #atariscne I met my  poet-pal Moondog for  the first
time. It was quite cool, but then he told me that he visited the  Avena homepage
and that Tommy of Avena is dead! ó"Really Dead?"ð, I asked and he agreed.
ñ"He committed suicide some weeks ago."ð I was  really  shocked! The  whole  thing
is roaming  around my brain since then and I had to  do something... to write it
down... This is what I found on the Avena homepage:

                                   òTommy
 ò   Was our musician and one of the nicest human beings you were likely to
  ò  meet. On 19.11.1998 he ended his life, left us all in grief and so far
   ò     without a clue as to why he did. His music has always been an
    ò essential part of what we have done. He was a loyal friend, someone
    òyou would want to be like. We cannot yet believe we have lost him. We
     òwill treasure the memory of him and his legacy of music for the rest
       ò                         of our lives.ð


He was truely  the best musician  on the atari-scene and I am very sad about his
dead even if I only met him for two times. The last time it was on the fantastic
ñSILICONvention'97ð where we had a discussion about electronic music and Electro.
I guess no one of us had expected things going like this...

Tommy did the music for many brilliant Falcon demos such as ñBuilt in Obsolesence,
òEnragedð or óSonolumineszenzð and also won several music compos  e.g. Fried Bits 3.
He's work was outstanding and counts to the best Atari have ever heard.

I've sent  emails to all the  Avena-dudes and  asked them if they  want to write
something about it for my article. Here are their comments:


Fried said:

>Who told you about Tommy's death?
 Bull. He was told by Tom G I believe.

>Was the death of Tommy the reason why TAT has left the scene?
 No, I don't think so. But you'd have to ask him.

>Can you imagine why he has done it?
 No. His latest  music is outstanding, better  than most stuff people earn money
 with  selling in the  stores. He could have been succesful with his  music this
 instant. We can only guess at what he was missing. He wanted to be a good human
 being, and  even if  was so (I mean  it) maybe  to him it wasn't enough. Its  a
 tragedy. We would  all have had our arms torn off for him. If only  he had said
 something.

>Last words?
 He didn't leave any.



Jet said:

>Who told you about Tommy's death?
 TomG->BULL->Thyroxin->Me

>Was the death of Tommy the reason why TAT has left the scene?
 NO!

>Can you imagine why he has done it?
 NO!

>Last words?
 His last words to me:
 Anrufbeantworter: Du bist mal  wieder nicht zu Hause. Na schoen. Ist auch nicht
                   so wichtig!
 (answering machine: You aren't at home again. Ok. It isn't important anyway!)



Tat said:

>Who told you about Tommy's death?
 Arne (Thyroxin)

>Was the death of Tommy the reason why you have left the scene?
 No. I left the scene 2 weeks before Tommy died.

>Can you imagine why he has done it?
 I haven't seen him for nearly 2 years, so I can't comment.

>Last words?

Thyroxin and  Boris didn't answer  yet and because of the deadline for the mag I
had to finish this article.

The  guys from ñAvenað announced  to make  as many of  Tommy's music  as  possible
available on their page (ówww.avena.comð) as mp3. So his legacy of music will live
eternally on the digital highway and will rule forever...

Rest in piece.
