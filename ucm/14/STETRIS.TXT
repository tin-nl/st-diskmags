If I remember right  this was the first release of the new born german PARANOIA-
label, already in the middle of 1998... but this project  was already started in
1997 but I saw it for the first time in the gone year.
This game is STE only and starts with a scrolling background, displaying the
PARANOIA logo, painted by PARANOID and the sign of the band, a razorblade.
This thing comes along with a tracker music, a nice one, but after all not very
remarkable.

After this intro which you can end by pressing space the main menu comes up,
with very colourfull stuff, like the game logo and of course  the menu with the
options.
If I said the grafix are colourfull it doesn't mean that they're stylish at all,
because it doesn't look so... colours aren't all and I for myself like much more
designed stuff, just like the "TRACE"...
Anyway, the use  of rasters and so on  isn't bad  and seldom for  freeware games
at all. Furthermore I think they have to underline the point that you're sitting
in front of an Atari STE.
And so  also in  the menu  there is a module played, old  stylish  techno stuff,
remembering  a bit to  the tunes used in the BLACK BOXES' "VENTILATOR" demo from
1992... tastes are  different but  I have to point out that I don't like it very
much. Happily  you have the possibility to copy other modules into the folder of
the game and select them from the menu in the game.

Other  menu points  are the  number  of players (one or  two), selection of  the
controls for the single players (keys or joystick). There  is following  another
menu  where you can  chose some options, how  many lines  you have  to finish to
reach  the next  level, how many lines you have to  finish to reach  the special
effects menu and so on.
Finally there is a point where you can select the display, means  if the rasters
have to  be switched on or off, which cpu speed your machine  uses (8Mhz for the
normal STE and 16 for MegSTEs) which has an  effect on  the replay rate  for the
modules and last but not least which module has to be replayed.
But to say it right now! Don't chose the point to display the whole game without
rasters! With rasters it might look a bit  childish and  overloaded, but without
it's just ugly, green and grey colours dominating the screen and any STE feeling
is lost within a few seconds!

Ok... other  points  are quit, but  I think  I have  to play  a round  now! So I
entered  the play area  and are confronted with two play fields, one  for me and
one is unused, coz' there isn't a second player around.
The game principe  of TETRIS should be known, just  complete the  lines with the
falling stones to delete them  and avoid it that the uncompleted lines reach the
upper border of the game field. 
The usefull thing is the  effects thingie... there are some special effects esp.
for the two players zone. So both players are able to kick  the otherone if they
reached this  menue with speed ups, unfinished lines  or disabled controls. Also
usefull things for the own play area are included like bombs. Nice idea.

More  things to mention? Hum, the  playfield is  stuffed with adverts  and Atari
banners which goes  a bit onto my nerves because it diverts again and again from
the game itself...

Have I say more to the technics? The controls running ok, would be a bit strange
if not.

And I  think that's  all for this game, just  remember it's "only" TETRIS, a bit
more STE a like  but over all nothing special. I for myself aren't very happy to
see another TETRIS clone because it isn't a game principe  which bounds me on my
machine  for more  than a half hour, even as two player game, because  there are
much funnier multiplayer games around, sorry.
So I want to come to my final...

Conclusion: "STETRIS" sounds  from the name  like a thing you have to get if you
            own a STE. But it isn't, sorry. STOS seems to be too limited to make
            full use of the STE features, esp. in comparison with other free STE
            productions "STETRIS" looks  a bit  disturbing. The level of the gfx
            is all other than high end and a bit boring. The  sound isn't on any
            STE standard as well (sounds like 12 KHz or so...), about the module
            I don't want to say anything, techno, don't like this style, but you
            can exchange  them. The controls  are ok  and this is a  point which
            counts, the offered options and specials may give  the players a bit
            more  motivation but  at the end it's  still TETRIS and so  it's all
            other than a highlight, at  least in  my eyes. STE fanatics who want
            to have software which makes full use of their hardware should leave
            their hands of this game, all other 5 minutes players can get it for
            a try...

The  motivation is  thought for  a single  player... unfortunately I  hadn't the
possibility  to catch another  one and bound  him on my STE to check  out if the
game is more addictive to two players...
