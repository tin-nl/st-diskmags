I was really surprised as MC LASER told me that MAC SYS DATA suddenly released a
few new compact disx again... Of course I hopped to see new stuff on those disx,
not again and again old  intros and demos, digged out of the  dustbin. Anyway it
was  a new  sign of hope on the darkened  compact disx  sky, after  MATT of STAX
seems to have lost all motivation in doing new menues.

I think  the name  MAC SYS DATA should be  wellknown, esp. for the guys  who are
collecting compacts since the old days (gnaaarf!) and without any doubt the POV-
compacts  belong still  to the  most interesting disx released so  far. Ok, they
never  had such stylish intros as  the ANIMAL MINE GSC's  but even in  the later
years they  still contained  some real nice  productions and  meanwhile the most
other compact bands faded away, MAC SYS DATA surprised the crowd again and again
with new releases, even if the most people thought he gave up coding at all many
years ago...

It seems to be a big problem that the spreading of new releases isn't as good as
in the former years. Ok, we have the Internet but even there not all productions
are available and so it  takes sometimes a  while till the  productions crashing
into our little world.

Anyway, MAC SYS DATA, the  last survivor  of the british  demo compact scene has
done  a nice job  with his latest  release, because he  tried to make  the whole
thing compatible to  the PaCifiST, maybe to reach some old Atarians  who are now
suffering under Windows95 or so, just to show'em  that there is  still some life
on the good old ST...

This compact starts with the wellknown POV booter, showing a black/white logo of
the band. Btw, the whole thing is done by MSD himself, because he's the last one
working under this label for years now. The menu  itself is  just the wellknown-
piccy-scroller-thingie, with the typical  colourfull POV logo and a nice sid zik
by ANTICHRIST of SECTOR ONE, ripped  from their  old demo "OH NO! MORE FROGGIES"
(end part). So the  menu isn't  the hype  at all, esp. because  POV menues never
featured such  a reset menu loader as the AM compiles (if the  loaded intro does
not exit  right just  press reset to come back to  the menu, without  loading it
again...).

On this disk you will find the following stuff...
- "BLAIR-O DEMO" by TYPHOON
  STE only, the latest thing on the disk and reviewed in UCM # 13, unfortunately
  it's also the damaged version  and don't runs  right from the  menu! The whole
  thing bugs  in the greetings part and offers some grafic failures in the first
  screens...
- "TECH PACK 15 INTRO" by THE BRAINIACS
  An old  intro =( and it was already released on  other compacts too... but MAC
  SYS DATA revealed the faked fractals in the intro.
- "GRC BBS INTRO" by THE GRIM REAPER CREW
  Another  old screen, without  the chance  to quit (as the most BBS intros). It
  announces the DIGITAL DREAMS BBS... ooould...
- THE HIDDEN TRUTH intro
  An intro by a british lamerband, done with the DCK and maybe ripped grafix (at
  least the little portrait pics of the  members looking like  a ripp-off of the
  TLB faces painted by SPAZ...), not worth the diskspace!
- "LE JOLY PETIT MATIN INTRO" by THE CONCEPTORS
  Another "grotten"old intro... no comment.
  
Erm... I think I  wrote enough and my  comments about the  included stuff (ooh I
forgot the POV COPIER and this is maybe the most impressive screen on  the whole
disk!) should give you an idea about my...

Conclusion... yes! At first the  positive: it's a  POV Menu! Yep! It's full with
            ST/e warez... but at second, it doesn't  feed the hype about the CDs
            made by PERSISTENCE OF VISION and  I was really  disturbed about the
            included stuff, esp. because the only interesting  thing doesn't run
            right from  the menu and is inlcuded as damaged version too! Not the
            best thing! The other included stuff is very disappointing  too. MSD
            claims that not enough  new ST stuff  was released  in the last time
            but so I have to ask what the hell we're  testing in the UCM?! There
            are still some  releases around, every  week, ok, it's  hard to  get
            hold of it  in time but it's  possible, even  for me as the one with
            the still not existing Inet access!
            Final words: just a disk for collectors!
