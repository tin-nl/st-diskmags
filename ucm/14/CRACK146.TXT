       ñCrackman in search for his dealerð by òTeenageð (1998) [óSTE/Falconð]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------       

Teenage are increasing speed again - This is already version 1.46.

Crackman is a PacMan clone that  looks rather  like the popular McMinos than the
original PacMan. Mazes are  not symmetrical, number of monsters varies and there
is no ñPowerpillð - at least not the typcial one.

After loading, Crackman  displays the  title-screen in  blue and  metallic-grey,
plays the titlesong and awaits your command.

New in version 1.46: When  a key is  pressed, a menu and a starscroller appears,
well animated, allowing you to select between òStart, Infoð and òQuitð.
òInfoð of course explains the game, displays greetings and credits.
òStartð begins your search for your dealer.

The first maze  doesn't feature monsters at all and is simply to "introduce" you
into the game - an excellent idea.
The second  maze contains one  monster and it must be said that the monsters are
òveryð intelligent - Simply  evading or  running in front of them doesn't put them
off long, you  have to ñlureð them into points in the maze where  they are trapped
or cannot escape easily ñdueð to the way they are programmed.
For a beginner - or someone who is used to evading and running away from ghosts,
like  it is  sufficient  in ñmostð  PacMan clones - this  is  hard to  adjust  to,
however, it is a ònewð way to program the monsters.

Additionally, you  can pick  up ñPowerpillsð. For example, you can  collect òspeed-
òup'sð, which are spread rather often throughout the later mazes. 
Crackman then  moves a lot  faster and a sample or a short mod is  being played.
When the mod ends, Crackman's Turbogear is finished as well.
Or you can pick up ñbulletsð and òshootð monsters or pick up ñminesð to òtrapð monsters,
which then vanish.

There  are also  special ñfloor-patternsð in  this version, patterns only Crackman
can move over or patterns that can be moved over by the ghosts once Crackman has
moved over them.

If Crackman hits a monster, he dies a real bloody death and starts back where he
began the  maze. By the way, the mazes are usually a lot larger  than the screen
so Crackman  keeps scrolling, in  fact, the Crackman sprite seems to stay at the
same place all  through the game and  the maze always scrolls  according  to the
direction you want to move Crackman into.

If you finish a level on the other hand, a short text is being scrolled onto the
screen, another nice sample/mod is being played while the computer awaits you to
press fire and continue.

So, is òCrackmanð just another ñPacManð-clone or is it different?
One thing is for sure, with version 1.46, òCrackmanð made a ómajorð leap forward.
It still  scrolls smoothly in  all directions, sprite movement is smooth as well
and the ghosts look good and are being animated in a nice way, too.
The sound effect  being played  most of  the time sounds a bit  simple, but that
really doesn't  matter as the title-music  and the music  between the  levels is
quite  good - I  didn't  like  the "bonus"-musics, but  they  are  just  not  my
favourite style, which doesn't mean that they are bad.

But the  point I critized  most before - the ñoverintelligentð ghosts  have gotten
the óbestð part of  Crackman now that the leveldesign is smarter and gives you the
chance of luring and trapping the monsters by abusing their  intelligence, which
was not possible in the previous previews.

Along with  the ñfloor-patternsð with  special  functions  or  the  possibility to
ñshootð or ñblastð monsters  by picking up the appropriate extras, Crackman features
elements I haven't seen before in ñanyð òPacManð-clone on the STE before.
The only disadvantage I can think of is that ñkeyboard-ðcontrol is a bit fuzzy and
sometimes reacts a little odd, ñPowerPadð is highly recommended.

òCrackmanð  is  probably  not  the game  everybody  has  been  waiting  for. It is
completely ñdifferentð than  Crapman and  therefore  no  competitor. If you  liked
òPacManð and  can handle  a strange  kind of  dutch humour, òCrackmanð is  definetly
worth a look - it has gotten a ógoodð game by now.

What I would  personally see  in the final version is probably  some more musics
being played throughout  the game, perhaps  some even more extras like the òminesð
or the òbulletsð - but  most of  all ñmoreð levels  of the  kind included in version
1.46. They are fair and fun to play.

Let's see what the final version brings us.
