              ñHellgateð by òSmartSoftð (1998) ó[ST, STE & Falcon]ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------             

An Ex-member  of the Atari  community was  friendly enough  to give me a copy of
ñSTOS 3Dð. However, this  package is very complicated and besides a few 3D objects
being rotated  on the screen, I have never seen STOS 3D being used for something
serious. One who  mastered  STOS 3D is òDavid Waltersð of òSmartSoftð as ñHellgateð is
100% STOS 3D code.

After loading  the game you find yourself in a menu where you can select to load
a game, to resume a game or to start a new game.
After starting a game by either loading or starting a new one, you are presented
with a "map" which  building you will be transported to, a bit like in òDoomð (1),
but this time in isometrical 3D.

ñHellgateð then  starts  the  main game. On the  lower screen  you find  a control
panel, like  in  Wolfenstein 3D  or in Substation, directly  above  this  in the
middle of the screen a gun is shown.
By pressing  the cursor  keys you can "walk" in first-person-perspective through
the level and fire your gun.

Like said above, everything consists of  polygon-objects, there are  no textures
at all, so walls, enemies and even bonus objects are all polyon objects.
Movement  is incredibly smooth for STOS 3D, even  on an STE. The  controls react
quite quickly, so slick control of your character is given.

Usually, your  main task  is to find  the exit. This of course  requires  you to
shoot  opponents, which  mainly  consist  of  moving  or  static robots, pick up
medikits, ammunition, weapons, and of course keys.
After walking  through one  level, you are  being brought back to the  main menu
where you can save the game or continue.

So far, the  game has a  few minor  deficiencies. Wall detection works  alright,
although  they are  not displayed  properly sometimes. The  same counts  for the
doors, which  are a bit problematic as well. However, as a STOS 3D product, this
is already better than anything released so far.

The gameplay is pretty  good already. Entering a room usually confronts you with
the thrill  of having to look around and search for opponents, to aim  quick and
dodge the robot's fire.
Although the "ñshoot and coverð"-aspect that some other 3Dgames like this feature,
are not given in Hellgate, one can't complain about missing action.
The difficulty level increases quick, soon fast reflexes, a bit  luck and a good
overview is required.

The levels  itself are probably  a making, so far, they are bit too simple. Most
rooms are simply square and just vary in size and number of doors in the walls.
Although it is possible, that the game engine supports only square rooms yet, it
would be very good to see a more flexible level-design.

The Falcon plays  no music, on  the STE/STf some chipmusic is being  played. The
bitmap graphics are a bit simple and unfortunately don't underline the promising
character  of the  game well - I hope, David Walters takes his time  to redesign
the bitmap graphics.
The polygon objects look pretty good considering the fact that they only consist
of "ñsimpleð" polygons  without  textures. Probably  some  more  robots  could  be
designed, although the game really doesn't rely on this.

If  one  compares Hellgate  to the  other Wolfenstein-type games  on  the óST(E)ð,
òDestruction Imminentð and òSubstationð, Hellgate doesn't look bad at all.
In comparison  to òDestruction Imminentð, ñHellgateð is a bit  smoother, although it
doesn't top the average speed of òD.I.ð.
In contrast  to this, ñHellgateð features  real-3D sprites  and the more  flexible
movement ñinð the maze, which òD.I.ð doesn't.

òSubStationð features  the more professional  layout and of  course a better story
around the game  and the more professional design around the game itself. On the
other  hand,  ñHellgateð features  "textured" walls (consisting  of  polygons) and
again, smoother "real 3D"-sprite movement.

For  the  next version, I  wish, óDavid Waltersð would  redesign  the  surrounding
graphics and  menus and of  course look after the ñminorð bugs in wall-display and
door-detection. A bit  more flexibility in the level-design, which seems to be a
bit limited, would of course also improve the gameplay.

óHellgateð is a promising game. I wonder what the next version will look like, but
I'm pretty sure, it will be good.
