                         INTERVIEW WITH: JACKY OF A.C.F.

================================================================================

Hello Jacky!

When I spoke  the last  time to  Skinhead/ICS we  where  wondering  who  was not
interviewed for  undercover  yet. Now I met you on IRC lately  and than  it came
back to my mind to make an interview with you.



ÒUCM:    First tell  us a little bit of your history. How did you start computing
Ò        and what groups you were in.

ÚJACKY:  I began to program  on a Laser 210, Atari 800XL and came to the 520ST in
Ú        1986. ACF was founded by -Desire- and -Major- in 1987.
Ú        Two years later I joined the crew and we released some cracks and guest-
Ú        parts in several demo's. I got in touch with Agent -t- 1990 and he was a
Ú        new member beside Tao and Pooky (who was responsible for the NIGHTBOX).
Ú        We left the Cracker-scene in 1991 and released our first demo:
Ú        "Bloodsucker". One year later we released the 2nd demo: "Just Buggin'".


ÒUCM:    What are  your jobs  in ACF? Btw, is the group  still alive? (Homepaging
Ò        does not count!!! :-)

ÚJACKY:  Yep, we're still  alive, but -Desire- isn't  doing  anything  on  the ST
Ú        anymore. He finished his study and is in the army right now...
Ú        Agent -t- and -Tao- are  still  members, but doing their own  stuff with
Ú        Cream  at the moment. I  was the  coordinator  and  chief coder  besides
Ú        -Desire- and made the connection to the scene.


ÒUCM:    The crowd may be bored of this one but who cares? How old are you?

ÚJACKY:  26.


ÒUCM:    What is your current equipment?

ÚJACKY:  Two months ago, I bought a new 1040STE (4MB) and a Megafile to finish my
Ú        old stuff. I have  still my 520ST w/ 1MB (TOS 1.0) and a  Syquest, but I
Ú        feel more comfortable with the new equipment.
Ú        On the commercial  site I use a PC to do all the website-stuff  for my 3
Ú        www-domains.


ÒUCM:    What is your fave game for the ST/FALCON?

ÚJACKY:  I haven't seen much Falcon-Games, because I didn't own any one!
Ú        My favourite  game on  the ST is Dungeon Master. On the technical side I
Ú        prefer games like Wing's of Death, Lethal Excess and Enchanted Lands.


ÒUCM:    What is your fave demo for ST/FALCON?

ÚJACKY:  Very difficult  to say. There are lots of good demos around... e.g. from
Ú        Carebears, Overlanders or Lost Boys.


ÒUCM:    What interests do you have apart from computing? Fave music for example.

ÚJACKY:  My fave music is alternative music, like Rage against the machine, Stone
Ú        Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam and Clawfinger, who are friends of mine.


ÒUCM:    Can you give us a prove? Does CRIME NOT PAY???

ÚJACKY:  sorry, no.


ÒUCM:    Why did you put Nightbox offline? As far as I remember it was one of the
Ò        best boards around!

ÚJACKY:  I haven't  put it offline. It  was Pooky's BBS  and he  didn't wanted it
Ú        anymore. Just  write him an e-mail and maybe he'll put it  online again:
Ú        atrw05@rzserv2.fh-lueneburg.de


ÒUCM:    The  crowd surely  also wants  to know  what's  going on  with  the long
Ò        awaited JACKTRO? (The final ACF demo)

ÚJACKY:  Well, most of the screens are finished... since 1993/94. Since this time
Ú        I had lots of things to do. But I  think that I will get  more sparetime
Ú        when I move  into my own  house next year. Some of the screens  need new
Ú        design  and maybe  some new  music. By the  way, all screens  running in
Ú        fullscreen.


ÒUCM:    You are  also selling  Jaguar/Lynx-games a nd other  Atari-stuff. Do you
Ò        still make  money with this? Why are the prices for the  Jag-games still
Ò        so high?

ÚJACKY:  I have still lots  of games in stock for both systems. I am selling them
Ú        good at  the moment, but  the demand is getting  lower, so you  will get
Ú        probably cheaper prices in the next months.


ÒUCM:    Do you still have contact to the old-school-scene-guys?

ÚJACKY:  Well, only to a few... I've met Daryl/TEX on the Atari-Fair in Neuss one
Ú        month ago.


ÒUCM:    What do you miss the most from the 'good old times'?

ÚJACKY:  Probabaly the good old scene-parties. ;-)


ÒUCM:    Please tell us your point of view about the future of the Atari-scene.

ÚJACKY:  The scene will die when Atari dies in our minds.



ÒUCM:    BRAINSTORMING! Please give us a short comment on following topics.

Ò ATARI         -Ú it's my life.

Ò FALCON        -Ú haven't got one. :-(

Ò AMIGA         -Ú don't want one.

Ò PC & MS       -Ú There is no way to escape. :-(

Ò DEMOS         -Ú Better than playing games.

Ò SCENE         -Ú looking forward to meet some guys again

Ò CRACKING      -Ú I don't wanna miss these times...

Ò INTERNET      -Ú years to late...

Ò JAGUAR        -Ú in my point of view it's a good machine

Ò PLAYSTATION   -Ú owned one... only a week and selled it.

Ò NINTENDO 64   -Ú nice machine and nice games.

Ò VECTRONIX     -Ú good friends of mine

Ò DISKMAGS      -Ú interesting stuff



ÒUCM:    Have you any last words for the Atari-public?

ÚJACKY:  See you all in a demo on your monitor soon!


Many thanx for spending your time for us. Ceeeyaa!

Note: It took  me about 6 months  or more to get Jacky to the point that he sent
      me  the interview back  so the questions maybe  a little bit  outdated but
      there is only one guy who cares... ;-)
