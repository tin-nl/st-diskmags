================================================================================

                        INTERVIEW WITH: GRAZEY of P.H.F.

================================================================================

Hello and welcome to another one of those neverending tortures by the Undercover
writer  possee. This  time with  no one  else then  GRAZEY from the  P.H.F. from
Kingston upon Hull.


ÒUCM:       Hi Grazey! As for traditional reasons we ask everyone the same stupid
Ò           question  at the  beginning (or  is it  just  to get  Mr. Pink pissed
Ò           off?). Ok, how old are you and what are you doing in your real life?

ÛGRAZEY:    Hello everybody. Well I'm at the  sprightly age  of 28. Born  in 1970
Û           (I'm good at maths) and I missed been a  psychedelic 60's smiley-baby
Û           by 5 months :-( As for my REAL life. I live  in the Yorkshire city of
Û           Kingston Upon Hull  or  simply  Hull  as  it's  commonly  known. It's
Û           situated on the  East coast  of Northern England with a population of
Û           around 400,000, anyway I'm not  going to do a tourist plug so swiftly
Û           moving on....... I left school in  1986 then  for the next  6 years I
Û           studied computer programming/analyst at Hull College  then Humberside
Û           University. I got a job programming management systems under Dataflex
Û           (SQL). I left  that in late 1994 then travelled (inter-railed) around
Û           Europe  for a  few  months, taking  in  13  countries. Varied  cities
Û           included  Lisbon  in the  West to  Naples in  the South, Budapest and
Û           Zagreb in  the East and Alvesta (Sweden) in the North. On returning I
Û           became a postman for a year mainly as I wanted a  complete break from
Û           computing. For  the last  three  years I've  worked  for the  British
Û           government (that's all I can say!).


ÒUCM:       Tell  us and the  readers a little  bit of your  history. How did you
Ò           start computing and what groups you were in?

ÛGRAZEY:    I 've had a computer since 1983. My machine was a C64 with speedy C2N
Û           cassette  player! The  Christmas  of '83  was a  real boom  time  for
Û           computer sales  and it was a  battle between the ZX  Spectrum and the
Û           C64. Fortunately  the Spectrum had sold out from all our local stores
Û           which is why I ended up with the the vastly superior C64!!!
Û           (Spectrums owners were/are complete  dickheads!, hehe I've  alienated
Û           half of you now aint I ).
Û           At first I just played games, my first C64 game was Maggotmania which
Û           was an in-house Centipede clone by Commodore. Not long after I bought
Û           my first  C64 cartridge - International Soccer which was way ahead of
Û           it's time  coded by  Andrew Spencer  who is  still coding to this day
Û           (recently interviewed by The Edge).
Û           I got into programming by typing in those huge listings  which use to
Û           appear in  magazines (was  I really that sad?!), I then use to modify
Û           them and ended up writing my own programs.
Û           10 for i = 1 to 15: poke 53280,i: next i..
Û           The PHF was  set up in 1983 which probably makes us one of the oldest
Û           crews. I 've been  a member since the beginning, I'm also a member of
Û           D-Bug which carried on when Automation stopped at menu 512.
Û           At first I just ripped music for D-Bug menus but later I was the menu
Û           compiler and also hacked the odd title, I maintain the D-Bug web site
Û           too.


ÒUCM:       P.H.F. means  Pseudo Hacking  Force... Does this has a special reason
Ò           and what are your jobs in P.H.F.?

ÛGRAZEY:    NO it  doesn't! ;)  It  stands  for  Psycho Hacking Force! We  didn't
Û           publicise the  meaning until the  release of  UMD 5, it added  to the
Û           mystery.
Û           Why PHF? Well  at that  time in  the C64 scene nearly all crews had a
Û           three  letter acronym (eg. UCS, SCS, ESI etc). I know  it's not  very
Û           original but we were/are all psycho's and we all love to hack!
Û           I'm the  main driving  force behind the PHF. I do a bit of everything
Û           really, on  the C64 I coded  in BASIC, progressing  of course to 6502
Û           and this  is also were I  cut my music ripping teeth (very similar to
Û           ripping on the ST, most drivers had an init and play routine).
Û           I bought an  ST in 1987 for  the first year  or so I just did graphix
Û           using  Neochrome (Degas sucks.....oh yes it does), check out  some of
Û           my art work in the "Grazey Gallery" at http://phf.atari.org
Û           So  I've  coded, hacked, mailed  and  done  gfx, I  suppose  the only
Û           discipline yet to get the Grazey treatment is music composing.


ÒUCM:       What is your current equipment?

ÛGRAZEY:    I still  have my  original C64  but it's  on it's last legs. It still
Û           just about works even with my D.I.Y. job on the VIC chip - one of the
Û           legs broke so I soldered a paper clip to it as a replacement!).
Û           Other peripherals for my C64 are a 1541 disq drive (Sloooooow), a C2N
Û           tape  drive (slooow  until  Cyberload!), Expert V3.2 Rocket cartridge
Û           (invaluable in C64 hacking), MPS 801 printer (noisy!).
Û           For Atari stuff I have an Atari  1040 STFM, External Drive  plus I've
Û           just acquired an STe for free.
Û           Amiga1200, 10 meg ram, 50mhz 030 processor 1.2 gb hd, external drive.
Û           Siemens 233 shitty PC with 32 meg ram and 2 gig hd.
Û           (ALL these fit on 1 desk, 2m by 1m!).


ÒUCM:       Have you any hobbies or interests besides computing?

ÛGRAZEY:    Mainly  football. I  support  my  local  league  side  Hull City (The
Û           Tigers). I go to all home matches  plus some  away too. Went to Luton
Û           yesterday to see the mighty Tigers maul those southern softies...
Û           Yesss!! Also music, I've got a varied taste in  music - indie, dance,
Û           hardcore metal. I go to a local club  called the Adelphi which is two
Û           terraced houses knocked into  one, you see lots of bands there before
Û           they become famous  such as - Pulp, Oasis, Radiohead and Stone Roses.
Û           Also like  the  Prodigy, Beautiful South, Stereophonics, Red Snapper,
Û           Tangerine Dream, Fila Brazilia, Vest, Dog Muck & Alanis Morissette.
Û           Other  hobbies? Drinking!!!  Love  Black  Russian's (Tia Maria, Vodka
Û           & Coke) also Stella Artois. Travelling.


ÒUCM:       You have  announced to release the Ulimate Muzak Demo 6 at the STNICC
Ò           2000. Can you  please tell us  a little bit more about that and other
Ò           future projects?

ÛGRAZEY:    Well I'd been  thinking of coding one  last music demo  for ages, but
Û           when  Richard  announced  the  STNICC  it really  spurred me  on  and
Û           motivated  me to start UUMD (Ultimate Ultimate Muzak Demo). We've got
Û           alot to thank  ST News for  as it  was TEX's  coding  articles  which
Û           inspired all PHF members  to learn  68000. Back  to the  demo, what I
Û           plan is a demo  which will  have the most  comprehensive list of chip
Û           musics available. It will of course combine  all the  musics from the
Û           previous 6 demos (excluding digi zaks) but will also contains lots of
Û           new tunes too. Many tunes have been written since UMD 5 was released,
Û           most using  the sid sound  routines. I'm also  collaborating with Mr.
Û           Styckx who is  going through lots  of old stuff  for tunes which were
Û           never  ripped for one reason or another. The current  number of tunes
Û           for UUMD is 3283!! and there's lots more to follow. The only downside
Û           is that the  demo is so big  a floppy disk version will be out of the
Û           question. Even if the data is packed it would still need 15 disqs! So
Û           it will be hard drive  only. Fortunately the demo will also work with
Û           the many emulators around  now (Winston, Pacifist) so it should still
Û           be available to a large audience.


ÒUCM:       We all know you are a true old school ripper, so... have you any idea
Ò           how many  chiptunes you  have ripped during  your long career  in the
Ò           computer world?

ÛGRAZEY:    Oooh that's a hard one. Let's  think.... I reckon I've  ripped around
Û           200 on the C64. The  ST mmmmh say  700 music  files which  equates to
Û           around 2000 tunes. I have  also ripped tunes on the Amiga but I don't
Û           count these as they are only MOD's hacked  with a custom  ripper such
Û           as Exotic or Gryzor's Pro-Wizard (apart from TSL's Pinball zaks which
Û           I manually  ripped, they  use  their  own  player - Digital Illusions
Û           player). I rip ALL my  tunes by 'hand', the tools I use  are :- Toxic
Û           Monst, Easy Rider 4, GSRv3.2 plus  many little  utils I've  wrote - I
Û           use no automatic rippers.


ÒUCM:       What was the 'hardest to rip' music you've ever ripped?

ÛGRAZEY:    Aaah, another hard one. That's a difficult question, I  would say for
Û           length of time to rip, then  it would be  Barry Leitch's Rock N Roll.
Û           The thing is I was still new to  ST music  ripping and used  a really
Û           lame way to hack it! I think it took about a couple days to do!
Û           Nowadays of  course it  would take only  5 minutes to  hack. I always
Û           make my music rips  PC-Relative which  usually takes  longer than the
Û           actual ripping, thankfully  most musicians  now use PC-R code.
Û           Going back to the  Rock N Roll at the  time I still wasn't offey with
Û           68000 so there  were lots of things I was doing which were completely
Û           wrong or that could have been done in a fraction of the time.
Û           With Rock N Roll it was originally  absolutely located  low in memory
Û           $1b000 and I manually  altered over 500  addresses in MonST to $6b000
Û           so it was higher  in memory (aaargh!) With my GSR this  would be done
Û           in microseconds. By the GSR was  a program  which patched  some of my
Û           code onto a music file which  automatically relocated a music file to
Û           play from any memory address. Once  you become a competent ripper you
Û           get to know each musicians music driver  so any new tunes they do are
Û           dead easy. For UUMD I'm still finding some new music drivers eg. Paul
Û           Tonge (Civilisation and B17) this took about  an half an hour to work
Û           out but now it's done the  other ones he's  composed will be straight
Û           forward. The  only  tunes  I gave  up  on (my  head  was  starting to
Û           explode) were done by Jason Page (Graftgold) but thankfully Mr Styckx
Û           persevered and finally ripped the  tunes (Rainbow Islands, Realms) so
Û           they'll be all included in  UUMD (Nice work Nic). Graftgold use their
Û           own operating system which is  very hard to hack, just try and find a
Û           file version of Fire & Ice or Realms.. go on I challenge you!!


ÒUCM:       What  about the  other guys  from P.H.F.? Are they still  active like
Ò           you, or are they all gone today? Have you still contact?

ÛGRAZEY:    Well  the PHF has  had a number of  members over the  years, which is
Û           what you would expect from  a 15 year crew. The most  members we ever
Û           had at  one time  was 4 (Me, Cal, Johnny 99 & Steely Dan). The 3 core
Û           members  still  remain  to this  day (Johnny 99, Cal & Me). Cal is my
Û           best friend  and we share  the same interests  with regards music and
Û           computers. He works for a local  computer firm  programming in Visual
Û           Basic, he also spends his lunch times writing 3D dot demos in Delphi!
Û           He doesn't  have an ST  any more but he  will be coding some bits for
Û           UUMD. His last major  coding project was writing the Amiga conversion
Û           of  Hollywood  Hustler  which  got  released  commercially.  I  still
Û           occasionally see Johnny 99 but the scene  flame blew out  a number of
Û           years  ago,  his  interest  has  recently  been  rekindled  with  the
Û           emulation scene. We were never a crew spread all over the place, more
Û           like a  set of friends  who coded for  fun. Other ex members included
Û           The Morts, Glenn (supplier) and Nev.


ÒUCM:       Have you any fave games/demos for ST/Falcon?

ÛGRAZEY:    I'm really wittering on with my answers aren't I?! Well  I'll try and
Û           make things more concise. Firstly games , I'm  not a  strategy freak,
Û           I love shumps and  aardvarks (Zzap! 64 phrases - meaning Shoot Em Ups
Û           and Arcade Adventures) -  Hostages, Great  Giana Sisters, Gridrunner,
Û           Kick Off 2 & Llamatron. that was such a hard selection narrowing down
Û           all the great games I've played over the years, but every one has the
Û           same  ingredient....Playability  which is sadly  lacking with most of
Û           today's packaged tosh. Demos..... well I'm not going to be surprising
Û           here of course the legendary  Union figure  with the B.I.G. Demo, and
Û           Union Demo. Also a British demo  which I think  often gets forgotten,
Û           and for it's time was technically excellent  is the XXX International
Û           demo (also a member of the Union). One more to add to the list is the
Û           Inner Circle's Things Not To Do demo which is  the most humorous demo
Û           I've ever seen.


ÒUCM:       The best memory you have from your life in the atari-scene?
Ò           (best party, etc...)

ÛGRAZEY:    Well it has to be the PHF coding  piss up held  1989 at a picturesque
Û           county  farmhouse in deepest  Yorkshire. All  members of the PHF were
Û           present  along  with our  college friends  and also  some  commercial
Û           coders (who  later  went on  to  write  such  classics as Lure OF The
Û           Temptress and Beneath A Steel Sky). Each  person  selected  one  game
Û           and we all competed in a rota (the points scoring got scrapped as the
Û           alcohol  began  to take  effect), I chose  Great Giana and  under the
Û           glare of  the other 20 people there I completed it for the first time
Û           (what a crap end sequence BTW!), there was lots of cheating  going on
Û           with people knocking power sockets when a high score was in  progress
Û           but a great unforgettable day none the less. concise? yep.


ÒUCM:       VR-SECTION. DUNGEON MASTER. You  are  one of the  four  characters in
Ò           Dungeon Master... which one  would you  choose (Magician, Warrior...)
Ò           and what guys from the  Atari scene would you choose to complete your
Ò           party?

ÛGRAZEY:    Dungeon  Master? naah  to  strategic  for  me, I would  play  Virtual
Û           Gauntlet. I  would  be  the  Red Warrior.....  "Red Warrior neeeeeeds
Û           foood badly!" who  would  I have  on my  team? Well  I'd  have a Blue
Û           psychiatrist (aka Alien  of the  Pompey Pirates) he would  delve into
Û           our foes minds  then torture  them with  Conservative Party Political
Û           propaganda and if they still didn't submit he'd nuke em! My Green Elf
Û           (aka Was (Not Was) / Vapour / Hot-Knife) would  definitely  be  on my
Û           side as he's the best hacker ;-)) and to complete my formidable squad
Û           I'd have a  Yellow Magician (aka Ruthless Of  Awesome) because of his
Û           magical disappearance skills. We would be unbeatable!
