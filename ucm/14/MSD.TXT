               INTERVIEW WITH: MAC SYS DATA of PERSISTANCE OF VISION

================================================================================


Hi Mac Sys Data!

When everyone  in the world  nearly forgot  you and POV, you came back last year
with another menu and you have reached Menu #163 today. We thought this would be
the brilliant moment for an interview. So here we go:


ÛUCM:  As for traditional reasons we ask everyone the same stupid question at the
Û      beginning (or is it just to get Mr. Pink pissed off?). Ok, how old are you
Û      and what are you doing in your real life?

ÚMSD:  I'm 31 years old and in REAL life I design computer networks and configure
Ú      firewalls/mail servers (unix only).


ÛUCM:  Tell us  and the  readers a little bit of your history. How  did you start
Û      computing and what groups you were in?

ÚMSD:  It all  started when  I bought a ZX81 following on via a Sinclair Spectrum
Ú      128, then onto an Atari STFM in 1988.
Ú      A friend and I  started POV  but he dropped out about POV disk 6. Over the
Ú      years  I have released  stuff under 'Ivor Biggun' when  the content  was a
Ú      little dodgy for POV.
Ú      For other crews I coded under the name of 'Spaceman Spiff'. I have written
Ú      menus for loads of crews including Adrenalin UK, Serenade, etc.


ÛUCM:  What are your jobs in PERSISTANCE OF VISION?

ÚMSD:  Everything! Coding and packing mainly but I rip music and  occassionally I
Ú      do some art.


ÛUCM:  What is your current equipment?

ÚMSD:  4 Meg STE
Ú      4 Meg Falcon 030 with FPU
Ú      120 Mhz Intel Pentium
Ú      233 Mhz AMD K6 with Voodoo II, 10 Gig HD, CD Writer, DAT drive
Ú      Jaguar with 3 games (in the attic)
Ú      Lynx MK I


ÛUCM:  Have you any hobbies or interests besides computing?

ÚMSD:  Yeah motorcycles. I have  a Honda CBR400RR Tri-arm and (check this out). I
Ú      have just WON a Suzuki GSX-R600 (worth 7000 UK pounds)


ÛUCM:  PERSISTANCE OF VISION is  also a raytrace-programm for Atari. Have you had
Û      ever any  problems with the law, because of using the same  name? (special
Û      question dedicated to mOd ;-)

ÚMSD:  No. Some people  in Atari circles  seem to think we are the  same group. I
Ú      was a little miffed that our name was hi-jacked.


ÛUCM:  Why have you  decided to  go on with  your compilations, which are btw the
Û      only survivors besides STAX from the early days, last year?

ÚMSD:  I like coding. Over the years I have packed loads of  demos and still have
Ú      a lot  left over. I like to play games but there are times  where I prefer
Ú      to sit down and work on a new menu.


ÛUCM:  Do you feel like a pioneer when you look back to the beginning of POV?

ÚMSD:  Certainly  do, POV were the first  demo compilation crew  on the Atari but
Ú      because of our poor distribution we were never well known outside the UK.


ÛUCM:  You told me  about a new demo called 'JESTERDAY'. Can you please tell us a
Û      little bit more about this project and any other future projects?

ÚMSD:  JESTERDAY is a  Falcon only music  demo featuring mods from  Jester/Sanity
Ú      (Amiga). I have the main code working and am just working on the intro. As
Ú      I no longer  have an artist I have been struggling to get some decent art,
Ú      so this is slowing development.
Ú      I have lots of things on the go but most are inhouse developments.
Ú      I plan to release POV164 as soon as I get some decent demos together.


ÛUCM:  What about the other POV-members? Are they still alive or are they gone?
Û      Have you still contact to them?

ÚMSD:  I have contact with one member, here is the list including old members who
Ú      have left;
Ú      Dr Syne...Moved onto the PC, I still swap titles with him and speak
Ú                weekly.
Ú      Aly.......Moved to Portsmouth, I see him about once a year.
Ú      Boris.....Moved to  America and now codes games  for Leftfoot  productions
Ú                (N64).
Ú      Oz........Went to college and never came back!


ÛUCM:  Have you any fave games/demos for ST/Falcon?

ÚMSD:  I love  Grotesque by  Omega for the  Falcon. Most of the  demos by EKO are
Ú      good. As for games, I liked the thinking games like Logical, etc.


ÛUCM:  Well, how  do you  see the  situation  of the  Atari-scene  on your island
Û      (Great Britain that is... :-)?

ÚMSD:  Very poor. In 1993 the  scene just died, there is a revival started off by
Ú      people  from Britain  in the form of Fatal-design.com but most people have
Ú      moved to the PC or consoles.


ÛUCM:  The best memory you have from your life in the atari-scene?
Û      (best party, etc...)

ÚMSD:  When Atari Format mag, reviewed our compilations and demos.


ÛUCM:  VR-SECTION. DUNGEON MASTER. You  are one  of the  4 characters in  Dungeon
Û      Master... which  one would you choose (Magician, Warrior...) and what guys
Û      from the Atari scene would you choose to complete your party?

ÚMSD:  I would be  the Warrior. I think  I'd chose  Vapour, Mug UK and  Grazey as
Ú      comrades.
