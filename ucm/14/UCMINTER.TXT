                         INTERNAL UCM WRITERS CHARTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because I was asked to include the writer charts again because they motivate the
writers to kick their keyboards, here they come again...
I have to  admit that MC Lasers part included all interviews, Email and Homepage
lists, which got final touches by myself, moondog, hehe...

Ok... the rest of the mag is filled with text files we downloaded from somewhere
or we got  from different  people with the permission to spread  them. The usual
stuff like  greetings and credits  lists aren't  mentioned in the  charts above,
because there isn't much work in doing them. I wrote them mainly by myself but I
don't want to count them as real article work. Listed in  the charts are all the
articles where the writers are mentioned in the main menu.

Overall  UNDERCOVER # 14 don't smashed through any barrier, the megabyte  is far
away but  therefore we had just two months to  finish the whole thing and as you
can see the main work was done by just  4 guys, but without the others the whole
thing wouldn't look as bright as it is.

UNDERCOVER # 14 features all in all...

                      about 63o KB articles (unpacked)
                      about 5oo KB graphics (unpacked)
                      about 15o KB musics   (unpacked)

Over all  there are 8o articles included and so there aren't as much included as
last time but  please remember that  this issue was released after 2  months and
some days of hard  work instead  of 3 and a half one... We (or better I) decided
to speed up a little bit because so we can entertain you once more and after all
the included stuff is much more actual...
If you have any suggestions to our decision, please write us!

Ok... if you think you can beat one of the  writers above, get your keyboard and
write some stuff for us and the scene at  all! I want to  send a special message
to mOd who told  me that there seems to be no need for him to  write for the UCM
again if we're able to fill up the magazine without his help...
mOd: we're missing  your views about  the grafix scene and your  reviews! If you
     say there is no need for you as editor anymore I have to ask you why? There
     is ever a place on board for a good  and productive  writer! We'll wait for
     your  comeback... and hope for it... but if you've  thought we're unable to
     finish an issue without your help, you're so wrong!
