                       ATARI TRACKERSCENE REPORT II/98
                      -===============================-


Due to some heavy  timing problems between PoD and me, I couldn't finish another
TRACKERSCENE REPORT for UNDERCOVER MAGASCENE issue 13 in time.

Though, I  have  to THANK MR.PINK for  being a  very helpful  informationsource,
regarding  the  British "tracker developments." He supported  me  with  detailed
news, which will be included a  bit delayed  in this  report. Further, I want to
thank GREY/MSB for his imformation about the Polish trackerscene.

Some unexpected and MAJOR MOVEMENTS could  be  registered in the  recent months,
especially considering the development of Trackersoftware and mod-compilations.

This time  I also mentioned  things, that are not directly important  for people
who only use  trackers, but which can be interesting though in other branches of
computer supported  music. For instance I included some facts and  rumours about
the  development of  MP3-PLAYERS for  Falcon 030 or  new and  interesting MUSIC-
RELATED HARDWARE, such as soundcards for new ATARICLONES etc.

So I will try to  sort out the most important things and please you by using the
wellknown and useful order named "alphabetical" for the countries this time.

Do not expect every small detail in this report, a long time has passed by since
the last report and there happened really a lot. Sorry to all I forgot.

If you have  done or develope  something interesting related to Atari and music,
and you want me to mention it, please let me know. (505@atari.org)

Have fun!

  - PERKELE / DEPRESSION
    --------------------

    He is releasing new modules quite frequently on his nice designed  HOMEPAGE.
    There you can also download a lot of useful SOUNDTOOLS for the ATARI and PC.
    Since Perkele  still has  only an  ATARI ST, it  is  understandable, that he
    prefers  FASTTRACKER on PC. On ST I would even say, working with PRO-TRACKER
    sucks, because  everything  is so  damn slow  and the  maximum of the replay
    frequency is 16 khz. Maybe he will buy a FALCON then.

    But no, in a  way he is a musician on ATARI anyway. His brother "TRANTIC" is
    the coder  of the band  named Depression  and he did  the code  for a music-
    compilation  for the ATARI ST, which will present some tracks by Perkele and
    others.

    Some  news to  tell considering  that the  CENTURBO II  accelerator  and the
    project "PHOENIX", a new  and powerful ATARI CLONE  should also  improve the
    possibilities  of making calculationtimestealing musics, such as  32 channel
    modules or using realtime dsp effects.

    First, I am glad  that SOFTJEE's productions, as the excellent  DIGITAL HOME
    STUDIO will  be fixed, so  that these  programs will  make use of  the  more
    powerful systems (Centurbo II accerlated, for instance).

    But I really  don't have  the least idea, how that  looks like  with GRAOUMF
    TRACKER and all the other good programs.

  - DMA SC / SECTOR ONE
    -------------------

    is the nick of one of the  best musicians  ACTIVE in the ATARISCENE today. I
    suppose him to use PROTRACKER STe for his  modules and the way  he makes use
    of it is in my opinion quite professionel.

    DMA SC  was WINNER  of the  JEM '98 MUSIC COMPETITION. That just  proves his
    talent.

    The whole  trackerscene seems to be on a kind  of CHIPTRIP right  now, so is
    DMA SC.
    As most  of the  Chipmakers, he uses  SIDSOUNDDESIGNER, too. First  previews
    sound very good and "scavy" in style.

    Nowadays, DMA SC is surely  one of, if not  the best CHIPMOD COMPOSER in the
    ATARISCENE.
    For example, do  you remember  the great  Mad Max tune  in the "THERE ARE NO
    SHEEP IN OUTER MONGOLIA"-screen in TLBs "Ooh Crickey, wot a scorcher!" demo?
    Yes? However, DMA SC  converted  this  wonderful  piece  of  chipmusic  to a
    chipmod (Protracker), of course in a bit more "modern" style.
    All  the  conversation  work  was  done 100% by listening and trying, as the
    converter says.
    The conversation really is one of the few chipmods I like. Great stuff!!

    Let's wait for his next release, probably in MYSTIC BYTES MODCOMPILATION.

  - FLAYSID
    -------

    The excellent C64-sidmusicplayer is now available in a NEW VERSION!
    David CarrŠre  and Mikha‰l Myara released this new version (3.01) in the end
    of November 1998  and it features  many improvments. Many tracks  sound much
    cooler  than before  now partly  because several  special filters  have been
    implemented. Unfortunatly, some songs  sound a bit weird in the new version,
    but this will surely be fixed soon.
    Download Flaysid 3.01 at http://dhs.atari.org

    The developerteam  of Flaysid is also considering to create a mp3-player for
    Falcon 030. But this is just an idea till now.

    The maker of the famous GRAOUMFTRACKER is  unfortunatly pretty  quiet  since
    1997. His  homepage isn't  updated, he  does not  react on  emails  or  even
    snailmails.
    His last  GRAOUMF-related intention was to code GRAOUMF 2, featuring a  very
    lot of extra effects and functions and a recoded and faster shell.

    Maybe he is in the army now, what would give his behaviour a sense at least.
    But that's just a rumour.
    Actually nobody seems to know what happened to him and Graoumf.

    UPDATE: New rumours came  up about Mr.Soras. It seems as he  will update his
            homepage soon. So hoping for Graoumf 2 isn't that senseless.

  - BITMASTER / THE CHAOS ENGINE

    Bitmaster is not a trackermusician. Therefore he likes ATARI and has written
    a ST-soundchip emulator for the SONY PLAYSTATION. His aim is to create a ST-
    soundchip-music-compilation (featuring  graphics  by  Spy/Escape)  for  this
    system and it seems as the project will be finished as well.

    Further, some rumours  claim him to be  interested in coding  the FALCON 030
    again. After  having  coded  a MP2-player  years ago, he  now thought  about
    trying a MP3-thing, but he thinks it is too difficult.

    Btw, he  did a lot  of interesting hardware-related stuff with his FALCON as
    well. For  example, he  built an  adaptor, which  enables  you to  CONNECT A
    SECOND MONITOR to the Falcon 030, using the DSP-PORT!

    But ok, that doesn't belong in here that much.

    His  interest  regarding  tracking is  not existent  anymore  and was  fully

    more, and is probably more talented in doing that, instead of composing.

  - 505 / CHECKPOINT
    ----------------

    All in all my  releaserate has shrinked a bit, meanwhile the craprate of the
    tracks stays nearly the same.
    I have  done a  module  for the Mystic Bytes'  INTERNATIONAL MODULE COMPILE,
    using the glorious Protracker.

    Further I did  some chipmusic  for the new TRONCLONE "ZE TRACE" by LOUD! and
    have worked for different projects in the scene.

    MODULATION #2 is still (yes) not finished. There is only the littlest of the
    little bit to do and then it would be finished, but I am not the coder.
    However, you can expect it soon (still (yes).)

    TEARDROP INC. will soon make its first steps. (A single / EP)

    Ok, don't want to talk about myself too much.

  - JOE COOL / CHECKPOINT
    ---------------------

    Regarding  TRACKER MUSICS his  activities have  not totally  stopped, but he
    hasn't done  anything since  over a half  year. But that  is not  really his
    fault, finally the ATARI also has other sides than music :)

    But therefore  he is doing a lot of "real" musics, with his guitar. However,
    I am sure, when  both of us (Joe and me) get the needed inspiration, we will
    meet to compose Trackermusic again.

    I don't know what he is exactly doing, because we didn't meet for months.
    All I  can say is, that  he travels  around a lot  in  order to  being DJ in
    different European towns.
    But I suppose he still uses his tracker, if he has enough spare time.

  - LUEBKE / PARANOIA
    -----------------

    Another module  by this musician  was released in "BREAKDANCE" by the German
    Gamemakers PARANOIA.
    I suppose the module to  be quiet old, but  that does not  mean, that Luebke
    does not compose any musics on Atari anymore.
    Following  my last  information, he  now prefers  creating CHIPMUSIC, beside
    moduling.

    I haven't heard any chipmusic by him yet, but surely some of his pieces will
    be included in the forthcoming Paranoia releases.
    And if  there is  one thing  which is  sure, it is, that  there will  be new
    Paranoia releases! (think so)

  - MC LASER /.tSCc.
    ----------------

    "Bumm Zshek  Zshzzcheck - rumbeeeeeeep tssss.."
    This  was one  year ago. Today  Mc Laser  is more a "normal" musician, doing
    musics, that sound like music.
    Yes, I admit that I am a kind  of glad that  he isn't on  the "ELECTRO"-trip
    that much anymore. It got on my nerves after a while.

    So he  changed  his style  a bit to  something  like "Electrodancetechno" or
    whatever  and  released  a nice  module  for  UNDERCOVER MAGASCENE # 13  and
    supported PARANOIA by contributing a module to their game "BREAKDANCE".

    Further he wanted to  take part in the music competition at QUAST PARTY. But
    the organizers lost his entry as well as many others.

    The most  interesting thing  about Mc Laser probably is his new  interest in
    producing CHIPMUSICS.
    Two chipmusics  were included in UCM 13, and as it seems, the  scene has won
    another great chipmusician.

    Beside his computermusic activities, Mc Laser is DJ-ing in different CLUBS.

  - MILAN COMPUTER
    --------------

    No, the Milan  will not be  a computer, that is only  USEful for "USERS" who
    mainly make USE of APPLICATIONS. (grin:)
    You will definitly  be able to make  tracker music with  this computer, too,
    although there is NO INTEGRATED SOUND in/OUTPUT as in the Atari Falcon.

    Beside  the expansive  STARTRACK-card, which  features an  own DSP, there is
    already a  possibility  developed to  connect "ordinary" soundcards, such as
    SOUNDBLASTER to the Milan.

    And since  for instance SOFTJEE's DIGITAL HOME STUDIO will also be converted
    to the Milan, the  needed software  exist as well. But  I suggest  you to be
    careful with  buying something to fast, though. DIGITAL HOME STUDIO may need
    a DSP, but  the Milan has none. So you would have to buy the Startrack-card,
    to have  a DSP - but it really isn't little money you  have to pay  for that
    one!

    Well, the best thing is probably just to wait, what  configuration SOFTJEE's
    Milanconversion needs. But in  general, the possibility  to compose  tracker
    music on this machine exists, which is something nice.

    But one thing  can be claimed sure, at least now: You will  of course not be
    able  to  compose  any soundchip  music  on Milan, as  long as  there  is no
    soundchip in this computer.

    Something not too new, but what is in my opinion interesting to hear for all
    those, who cannot read the ST Computer magazine:

    Milan Computer  presented their system at the "Frankfurter Musicfair" half a
    year ago or so and they said, that there were a lot of interested people and
    that the  press did  like the idea  of the Milan  as well. For instance some
    music magazine called the Milan a "promising" project.

    I think that shows, that the interest in Atari computers in the professional
    musicbusiness  is still here  and Atari computers have at  least a chance to
    come  back  in this  business because  the majority  of  the musicians  were
    content with their Ataris and trust them, I think.

    Related to the marketing of  Atari clone firms, (but not  at all  related to
    music) there was an  interesting rumour readable in the Novemberissue of the
    ST computer.
    It said, that  a big  company (the name stayed  anonymous) is  interested in
    offering the Milan in their shops/markets.
    They wrote, that  this company  thinks, that  there is a good chance to make
    the Milan  successful. The reason  for the good  chance is in their opinion,
    that  the  Milan  will  attract  many  of  the  nerveless, dissapointed  and
    suffering  Windowsusers, by  offering a  stable and  working system with all
    programs, you need.

    Of course  we should  not forget, that this is a rumour, and everybody could
    have said that, but it sounds quite cool :-)

    At least  the first  three produced lines (2000 pieces each, if I am not too
    wrong here) of  the Milan  are sold out since ages, and many people  want to
    get their machine.
    I just think it is nice to see, that a clone is developing so well.

    And something else that doesn't belong  in here, but is  interesting though.
    The Milan will be presented in the German TV-channel WDR.
    Some years ago  the Falcon was presented there. The reason for presenting an
    Atari in TV was in both cases the same.
    The ST Computer  magazine asked the readers to send a postcard to the WDR in
    order to make them present the Falcon/Milan. And the readers succeeded  once
    again :-)
    UPDATE: Ok, the Milan was presented for ca. 4 minutes, which is quite litte,
            if we consider, that  the computershow lasted more than 7 hours. But
            anyway, the Milan  was at least  as long presented as the Amiga, but
            all you could  see, was the motherboard of the Milan, no desktop, no
            tower.. But  the frontman  of the TV-show  was quite happy about the
            development of  Atari. He seemed to like that Atarians don't give up
            so fast, and that the whole Atari-world continues, although there is
            no Ataricorp. anymore.

            A little quote, for all those, who like it:

            "I think, I have to get such a thing" :-)

            (freely translated to English)

    Sorry for this little very non-tracking related  trip into the  world of the
    Milan. But I will try to keep sticking to the topic now:  TRACKERMUSIC!!

  - NO / ESCAPE
    -----------

    He hasn't  done any musics for a  long time. His  last 4 Channel  module was
    released for the Interjam 98 music competition. He says, as long as I get no
    new and good samples, I am not interested in composing.
    But actually that is not too bad. He has more time for coding then.

    This software firm from Berlin has released a NEW GEM-MODPLAYER.
    It is a nicely designed 4-channel modplayer, that works as ACC and APP.
    Features like RANDOMPLAY, FFW etc. make this program appear very well.
    Unfortunatly there is now Ice-, Noise- or Atomicdepacker implemented.
    A DSP-moduleport  is already  in  development, but  not  supported  in  this
    version. All in all a good tool, worth to make use of.

  - SCY /.tSCc.
    -----------

    His last activities  were recognizable, when he sat on his  chair for hours,
    wearing headphones, at the  INTERJAM '98. There he  created the last module
    I have heard from him since that.
    Mc Laser mentioned, that SCY has finally left the scene, and we have to live
    without his funny and refreshing modules now.
    It seems to be true, I  suppose - he already composed his last module at the
    Interjam '98 using Fasttracker on PC. (Sniff)

    But of course, hoping for a comeback is not forbidden.

  - SONGDIGIT
    ---------

    This  is  a  new  SAMPLEEDITOR  for  WAV-/AVR-/DVS- and  AIF-samples. It  is
    completely GEM-compatible and works in all resolutions.
    It  features  effects, as  ECHO, NOISE  and  you  can  MODIFY the  sample by
    changing the waveforms.

    This program  offers the possibility to record samples as well. You can also
    record samples on Atari ST by using for instance the ST-Replay sample card.

    Recording samples  directly to  harddisk  is also  possible! The  program is
    PUBLIC DOMAIN, but unfortunatly hard to get.

  - TAO / CREAM
    -----------

    Never  believe  rumours! Because  if, CREAM's  new  MUSIC demo ("Do Things")
    would have been released since months.
    But as we all know, being delayed is nothing too special nowadays, we surely
    can expect to get a fine presentation of excellent chipmusics "soon".

    As it  seems, their  famous  chipmusican  TAO is currently  the most  active
    member. He had quite a lot of guest appearances in several intros.

    You could  call him  a kind  of responsible  for the  recently  started  new
    fashion of using music in a 4k-INTRO. In my eyes, this is a just a cool idea
    (Yes, I like musics) and should become "standart".

    Furthermore, he seems to support LEONARD's/OXYGENE demoproject a lot. If I'm
    not too wrong here, he for example did a tune for the reset-screen recently.

    And not to forget, he is still supplying UNDERCOVER MAGASCENE with exclusive
    musics, what is always very pleasant.

  - TOMMY/AVENA
    -----------

    He commited  suicide in November 1998. Thit is what the Avena-homepage says.
    I don't  want to  extend  that topic. All that  has to be  said is  probably
    "thanks for all!" and "bye, my idol.."  :(((((((((((

  - DAMO / REDLITE
    --------------

    I didn't  know  DAMO  aka  SPYHUNTER  before  the  development  of  the (now
    cancelled) BINLINER-demo  started. He earlier used to work with  CUBASE, but
    discovered PROTRACKER for this project once again.
    The music he did for this demo is an excellent drum'n'bass Protrackermod.

    And since it  would be a pity, if this module would remain  unreleased, Damo
    will possibily do a demo. He already coded many unreleased effects, so let's
    wait and see.

    Further, this  musician is betatesting GODTRACKER and  already  created some
    tracks by doing so.

    Damo also has some more commercial relation to music-buisness, as one of his
    songs will  be published on a CD soon. Some of his mates has created  an own
    label, so..

    ------------

    He is going to create another SOUNDCHIPMUSICDEMO for the  ATARI ST. But this
    time it will be the BIGGEST ever soundchipdemo ever done so far.
    Grazey is collecting and collecting and converting and converting..

    The demo will  be called "ULTIMATE ZIK" and will be put on several disks and
    will also work from harddisk.

  - MR. PINK / RESERVOIR GODS
    -------------------------

    It became a bit unusual silent around Mr. Pink in the last months. Used to a
    weekly  dose  of  Reservoir Gods releases, it  is a  quite  strange  feeling
    without the productivity of the isle.
    There were a lot  of projects planned, but nothing released for a long time,
    because Mr. Pink  has a  job somewhere, which steals him  probably a  lot of
    time, patience  and motivation  to keep on hacking the Falcon as  much as he
    did half a year ago.

    So the destination  of the GODTRACKER, which was one of those momentary lost
    plans is a kind of UNKNOWN.
    It was  aimed to become  a program  similar  to  Protracker, but  with heavy
    Midisupport. This sounds like a really nice idea.

    Surely Mr. Pink will  be back soon  and will continue his work on Falcon, or
    maybe he is continuing or even has never stopped.
    (Actually, I cannot imagine something else)

    UPDATE: Yes, Mr. Pink  is and was with us all the time. He just had no modem
            at  his  new  working  place. Also  some  first  screenshots  of the
            Godtracker appeared on the
            "Reservoir Gods Network News"-homepage, maintained by MSG.

  - MSG / RESERVOIR GODS
    --------------------

    He is fortunatly still here, with his stylish Protracker  modules. Of course
    it was  his main  task to  accompany the Reservoir Gods releases  with music
    again, for instance his "fractal music" in FRAKTAL PLAYGROUND.
    Or do you  remember his "ZELDA"-theme used in the recent Reservoir Gods GBX-
    release or the theme used in "BUNION CANYON"?
    All those gamemodules have been done by him.

    Naturally, MSG  contributed  to  the  Mystic  Bytes'  INTERNATIONAL  MODULE-
    COMPILATION as well.

    And MSG  has  finally (re)opened his  HOMEPAGE again. It is  wonderfully de-
    signed and surely worth a look.
    And there, you  can also  download all of MSG released  modules of  the past
    years.

    More modules  from him will only come out bundled with a new  Reservoir Gods
    release (which will come, of course!)
    We can expect  some modules  in the GBX-release of R-TYPE and in  the Godle-
    NESconversion of SUPER MARIO LAND II for Falcon 030.

    And  finally, not to  forget  about  the  gamemusics, that  he  will  do for
    Reservoir Gods coming-soon game "REPUBLIC" - a spyhunter remake!

  - SH3 / RESERVOIR GODS
    --------------------

    This musician  could be called  LAZY, but there is no reason for calling him
    inactive. He has done another strange track for MAGGIE #26 and will probably
    continue supplying this discmag with his GRAOUMF-pieces.

    On his homepage you can find his WESTBAM & RED JERRY's "LORDZ OF THE SONIC"-
    remix, which  should be  a good one. But I don't know, I didn't listen to it
    yet.

    Beside using GRAOUMFTRACKER, he now often works with  the first beta-version
    of the midirelated GODTRACKER.

    But this projects already goes  for some  months now, and  he seems  to have
    managed nothing.

    However, we should  expect this music demo, containing  modules only made by
    ACTIVE TRACKER MUSICIANS, soon - or maybe it is already released.

    Last  time I saw  him composing  using  OCTALYSER on the  QUAST PARTY  98 in
    ELBLAG. He probably took part in the compition with this module.

    Not to  much  news, I admit, but  it is  really  not  too  easy  to get more
    detailed informations about the Polish scene, if you do not live there.

    At least I consider him as active.

    UPDATE: Raster isn't active  on Atari anymore. He now  adores PCs  and hates
            Atari, what he seems  to emphasize as often as possible.  Well, some
            guys get the point about Atari, some not ..

    Ok, what Baggio says, and what is  the truth is  quite something  different,
    but I do not want to keep him out here since it might be true this time.

    Anyway, the  music in the mentioned demo was  actually a  modfile, which was
    converted  to a sample before the demo starts. Nice idea to save calculation
    time..

  - EVIL / DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY
    ---------------------------

    Evil and music?? What? ARG!!! Pleeeeeease not!
    Calm down, Evil is not going to torment us with any trials as musician.
    He is neither singing nor playing in a band nor something else.

    So, no reason for fear here.
    All I consider  worth mentioning is, that Evil has created (ok, not that new
    news) a MODULE ARCHIVE.
    This  archive is aimed  to be a  collection of all  DEMO-, GAME- AND MAGMODS
    that have been done and released on or for the ATARI.
    The idea  is similar  to AURAs soundchip site, just that Evils  archive only
    includes modules, no soundchipmusic.

    The  MODULE ARCHIVE  website offers  a NEWS part and  INFORMATION about  its
    contents. Btw, there are  still some  modules missed, so if you have  any of
    them, please send them to Evil.

    Something  else  to tell  about  Evil. He  started  online  competitions for
    different categories. So, for  instance, expect  some cruel modules  done by
    people, that cannot make music at all (Graphicans, Programmers).

    After his  comeback with  MIND DESIGN, he released a nice music  demo called

    chipmods. Unfortunatly  they are  all a bit  short, but the  themes  of  the
    tracks are just great. ("Bluesy" for example!)
    Worth getting it, if you like music.

    Another good  track by The  Viking was  released  in Mind Designs  INTRO FOR
    UNDERCOVER MAGASCENE #13. Here  you  get a nice  mixture  of  Goatechno  and
    chipmusic.

    I am waiting for more of his cool musics!

  - THOMAS / NEW BEAT DEVELOPMENT
    -----------------------------

    Whenever you ask him about his musics, he claims to be no good musician. But
    then - very  unexpected, Thomas releases an fantastic 4-KILOBYTE-INTRO which
    features a wonderful CHIPTUNE in ca. 500 bytes.

    There  weren't too  many songs  released by Thomas until now, but if he once
    composes, he does an excellent job, as I think.

    Nothing  is sure, but I heard and hope, that he will also contribute  to the
    Mystic Bytes module compilation.

    Apart from songs, Thomas has quite interesting plans regarding the branch of
    soundsoftware.
    No, I do not mean another "Miditool", but  he plans  to code  a NEW TRACKER!
    Only the FIRST STEPS are done, but he seems to be sure about continuing this
    project.
    The prospects are nice  to hear: The  tracker will  feature .MOD-format, and
    should beat OCTALYSER, since also REALTIME EFFECTS are planned!

    However, the  the tracker  is in development and a  Betaversion for  testing
    and bugreporting is planned to be offered to download.

    UPDATE: Thomas has now opened a little website, that gives information about
            his momentary codingwork.

  - TOMAS / NO CREW
    ---------------

    He  finished the MP2-PLAYER for Falcon 030 some time ago and seems to need a 
    new and challenge now.
    So he is thinking about the realization of a MP3-PLAYER FOR FALCON 030.
    And because  this is a rather hard to solve project, he started a discussion
    forum for everybody, who is interested.
    The forum  is a mailinglist everyone who does not want to talk shit all  the
    time can suscribe.
    So if you are thinking about doing something like a MP3-PLAYER for F030, but
    you think it is too difficult for you alone, you can join forces and support
    each other.

  - TOODELOO / DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY / YESCREW
    -----------------------------------------

    What  the  Reservoir  Gods  are  regarding  games, is  TOODELOO/DEAD HACKERS
    SOCIETY / YESCREW regarding tracking.

    Maybe the  days are  a bit longer in Sweden, but I cannot anybody else, with
    such a high and continuing release rate.

    He has done the musics for CHIPPIN FOR AIR #6 (or 5?).
    He has done the musics for X-MIX 1 - module compilation.
    He has done the musics for X-MIX 2 - module compilation.
    He has done the musics for X-MIX 3 - module compilation, too.
    He has done the musics for "A SOFTER SIDE OF TOODELOO" - modcompilation
    He has done a lot of musics for JUST MUSIX 4
    He has done a module for the Mystic Bytes modulecompilation.
    He has done some musics for Yescrews CAPY
    He has done some musics for "Digital Relaxation" - modulecompilation
    He has done a lot of other modules, too.
    He has done this and that.  Yawn... ;)
    He has done..


    ..pretty many modules, after all.


    His HOMEPAGE  was  dead  for  some  time, because of  some problems with the
    provider or something. I don't know, if it is online again, but it should be
    soon, as he said.
    UPDATE: It is now online again. And it is completely redesigned. Have a look
            at: HTTP://WOMBAT.LUDVIKA.SE/AE/TOODELOO/

    TOODELOO is  working on his first AUDIO CD now, which will feature a  lot of
    his recent tracks. Surely worth to have.

    The TEARDROP INC. project  between TOODELOO and 505/CHECKPOINT  is going on,
    although a bit slower than expected.
    We want to  release  our first  EP - single  called "LIFE IN PILLS" soon. It
    will probably include 4 techno-dance tracks. (Advert!:)

    So, no question, Toodeloo is here and alive and by  far the most  productive
    trackermusician, that is supporting the ATARISCENE these days.

    His next  productions  can be  expected  to be  called "REFRESHMENTS" (under
    the  YESCREW-label) and  "JUST  MUSIX 4 (or  was it  5?)", which  will  also
    include many guest tracks.

    UPDATE: CHIPPIN FOR AIR #6  released! It  contains  10 more  Chipmodules  by
            Toodeloo and a strange intro... have a  look at  it and  judge your-
            self :)

  - ZONK
    ----

    I was pretty surprised, when I read on the DHS-scene-site, that  Zonk became
    THIRD at the MUSICCOMPETITION AT DREAMHACK and is an ATARIAN.
    That's because I never heard anything about Zonk before.
    But it  is really cool  that there are frequently new musicians  coming, who
    finally manage the step into the public - for our all pleasure.

    So well, 3rd place  at a big  party like  DREAMHACK is  surely an effort. So
    congratulations!
    I neither know if Zonk will appear  more often  in the Atari  related public
    now, but I hope so.
    UPDATE: He told me, that he is currently working on new chipmods.

    The  module,  which  won  3rd  place  at  the  Dreamhack  music  competition
    (4 channel  compo, I suppose), is a chipmod and you can download it from the
    DHS-site at: HTTP://DHS.ATARI.ORG

  - COMP7 / THE BASSMENT
    --------------------

    There aren't too many news to tell about him. His only release so far (known
    by me) was 4 channel jungle-module for the "FUNGLE BEATS" demo by FUN.

  - GABBERKID
    ---------

    He  produces  GABBA in  a quite  professionel way  and  didn't make too many
    experiences  with trackers  yet. But he said, that he is currently trying to
    explore GRAOUMFTRACKER.
    So nothing is sure yet regarding trackermusics, but we should wait a bit.

  - LEXO
    ----

    This  musician  uses  DIGITAL HOME STUDIO  and is  convinced  that it  is an
    EXCELLENT and very RECOMMENTABLE program.
    That's  good to  hear, since I didn't get to know anyone before who has this
    program. Further  he will get his CENTURBO II - accerlator soon, so  he will
    be able to make full use of the many features in Digital Home Studio.

    Lexo is someone, who is in my eyes the prove, that there definitly are other
    unknown  musicians around. Just that we do not know  them, but they  exist -
    and that is a great feeling! :)

    However, Lexo's  favorite  music  style  is  mainly  GABBA  and "OLDSCHOOL",
    whatever that means.
    I couldn't hear any modules by him yet, but he said, that he wants to upload
    some modules somewhere someday :)

    This musician possibly will join the FALCON USES NETHERLANDS soon.

  - SENTRY
    ------

    So what happened to their 303-EMULATOR? The program is nearly finished, what
    does not mean that it will be released soon.
    All  maincode seems  to be  done, but  now the  project  depends  on T-tje's
    activity, because he wanted to make the "gui" (whatever that means).
    But unfortunatly  he has little spare time at the moment and so this coding-
    part is missing to complete the emulator.
    That means nothing else than: The 303-emulator is delayed :(

    From the MOD-side, there were no releases - due to a harddisk crash.
    Leon lost all his modules and first needs to get some motivation to make new
    ones, but some ideas already exist.

  - THE MATCH / FALCON USERS NETHERLANDS
    ------------------------------------

    Similar to  COMP7. His last modules were included in his cool game "SNATCH",
    which was more or less voluntarily released at the INTERJAM 98.

    Moondog  said  once, that  he is  trying the  SIDSOUNDDESIGNER now, too. Who
    knows..

    So I really do not have any concrete information about his activities in the
    trackerbusiness, but  some rumour  says, that he is working on the music for
    the next Fundemo.

No, it  doesn't  look bad  at all. There are a  lot of  talented  tracking-mates
around. And  there  are very  probably  more than  a lot  of talented  of  those
around, but unfortunatly not public.
On the  other hand, it  is always great, to discover  new and  unknown composers
again and again. So we could call it "ok", the way it is.

Good to  hear is, that there exist many hardware and software  projects refering
to computermusic on Atari. This is just a sign that there must be a high request
and a market for it.

If firms like  Softjee sell  a program  like DHS for  more than  250 DM, this is
expansive. But  if Softjee is developing new versions, updates and  programs all
the time, then there just must be enough interest in this software.

What I  hope most now is, that the "Atari future systems", as the  Milan, Phenix
or accelerated Falcons will be supported by many good programs.
We should take care not to stay too far behind other systems regarding computer-
music, if the Atari is wanted to get attractive for musicians again.

Things  like a  MP3-player, realtime audio  effects or  realtime  envelopes in a
tracker are just a must to become an attractive computersystem nowadays.
And fortunatly the prospects are good.


Keep it alive!   (please)
