     ñGodboy X: Zelda - Link's awakeningð by òReservoir Godsð (1998) ó[Falcon]ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you  thought, writing  a ñrole-playing gameð for  a puny handheld  console  you
can't look  longer than 10 minutes at without making your eyes go ñcrazyð, you are
perfectly right.
How wise  must òNintendoð have been that they did  write such a  role-playing game
for such a puny handheld console.
They must have known that there will be Gameboy emulators and that people, whose
eyes ñhaveð gone ñcrazyð after trying  to play such a game longer than 10 minutes on
the  Gameboy, will  prefer to play  such a game  on the Emulator  instead of the
original Gameboy.
Or, to put  it in a  nutshell, either you have a very  good optician  or you are
recommended to play Zelda rather on the Emulator than on the original Gameboy.

So far, only  PC-users were  able to play  the vast amount  of Gameboy  games in
appropriate  speed. Lucky  for us, the Reservoir Gods had another opinion  about
this  and so Mr.Pink  wrote the Godboy X, short  GBX, emulator, which now  plays
ñZelda - Link's awakeningð.

In  the  article  óTerminal Velocityð in  òUCM 13ð, I already  described  the  basic
functionality  of the GBX. It  basically plays òoneð specific Gameboy game  so the
ROM image  is included. It  offers  all  the  options  of  the  òGodleNESð series,
including óoverscanð and ówidescreenð.
In  contrast  to  the original ñGodboyð, it  doesn't play  samples instead  of the
original  ñSound FXð - it  plays so  effects at  all - but  allows  to  switch the
ñcoloured  spritesð off. Control device can be  selected to be  either òkeyboardð or
òPowerPadð.

ñZelda - Link's awakeningð starts where  Zelda is supposed  to end - Since I never
completed  the original ñZelda - The adventure of Linkð neither  on the óNESð nor on
the òGodleNESð emulator, I can't affirm this.

However, the  main actor  of the game is  stranded on an island after a terrible
storm. If I were stranded on a tropical island, I think I would take things easy
and hang  around the beach all day. But  since the island is of course instantly
flooded with  monsters, the player must of course get into  action, back  to his
duty and fulfill his quest.
Since the documentation supplied by the òReservoir Godsð themselves doesn't give a
hint what  the game  is all  about either, I think I don't need  to do  so here,
anyhow, usually  this  isn't ñtooð important  for a  RPG since the  story  evolves
through the game anyway.

So you  start in  an unfamiliar  bed (gee, where  did I  read this  before), but
instead  of a  tropical, exotic woman  by your  side, you just find  yourself in
front of a real ugly bloke who picked you up from the beach where you stranded.
Talking  to other  characters  can simply  be done  by pressing  a button  after
stepping towards them.
You are being  told where you  are and talking to another friendly character you
are being given your shield.
Leaving  the house  enables you  to roam the island, talk to other  people, read
books, learn spells, learn to use weaponary etc.
Only equipped  with your  shield, you can only defend yourself  of monsters, but
not kill any at first. Some  hints are given  throughout the game by for example
kids playing on the street or other non-active characters.

òTo the emulatorð
The emulation  allows smooth  and comfortable  playing, like it  is supposed to.
The  average  speed is  ñhighð, I hardly  see any  difference  if playing  with an
accelerator or not, at least not as there aren't too many sprites on the screen.
Since this is a ñrole-playingð game, speed isn't overimportant anyway.
Control devices are being emulated as well, so gameplay is really slick.
The ñGodboy Xð proves once again to be an excellent emulator although of course it
is not used to the max with òZeldað.

I suffered  from a few crashes, but  they happened at random and I  never played
the game on a ócleanð machine, so it could be that the emulator clashes with a few
of my accessories.
Nevertheless, the òemulatorð is very good and highly recommended.

óTo the gameð
ñZelda - Link's awakeningð is not directly the best part of Zelda series, as it is
òaimedð at the  Gameboy player, who plays a  game around  20 minutes in  a bus and
then wants  to save the  game to continue later on - in contrast to a real role-
playing game that requires you to play rather a few hours.
Nevertheless, Nintendo  tried to  compromise and supplied a suitable basis for a
ñrole-playingð game though, the island you play on is rather large, there are many
different kinds  of characters for  you to interact with and with just a shield,
you òhaveð to explore and solve puzzles.
But this seems to be the main content of the game, solving puzzles.
Development of  your  characters, like  for  example  in  "Phantasy III"  or  in
"Amberstar", is  rather secondary  and mainly  restricted  to  learning  to  use
weapons and gathering new weapons.

I'm a bit undecided about how to rate this game. ñZelda - Link's awakeningð is not
a bad role-playing game, it is not the highlight of the series either.
In  regard to  the capabilites  of the  Gameboy, it  is well  done  and  a ñgood
compromise if you see the average Gameboy-player.
For órealð roleplayers, the  game is too  small and allows too little influence on
"forming" your character. Since the game is freeware, just have a look yourself.

The ñgraphicsð are medium, the  sprites are  poorly animated  and the  surrounding
graphics are not very good either.
The ñmusicð is  rather good - òMSGð once again flexed his  muscles, it is  a bit too
short  though but  hey, ñanyð music  is too  short  for a role-playing  game, so I
wouldn't  blame òMSGð here, he  rather  managed  to write a  nice tune  that holds
extraordinarily long before you grow tired of it.

óConclusionð
The ñGodboy Xð showed  again the possiblities  it offers, the game emulated is not
bad either. Although  the ñGodboy Xð demonstrated  more of its power in òMegaMan 2ð,
ñZelda - Link's awakeningð however  is a totally  different  game. For  people who
like "light" role-playing  games, it's an  excellent  game, for "hardcore" role-
players, it's rather medium.
