                            NEWS FOR ATARI-CONSOLES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATARI JAGUAR

Yes, there are  still some more games in the pipeline and you have surely heard
soemthing about the forthcoming titles. If not here I list them again:

The new  megahit-game IRON SOLDIER 2 by Eclipse Software for the  JAG-CD should
be out now! It was announced to be  released in February this year. It is ready
since the german ATARI-fair last year.

Another game called BREAKOUT 2000 should be  also released  in these days. It's
the old concept in the style of the Nineties.

In the next weeks will the smash-hit WORMS come to the Jaguar. This great game,
which  looks like  a mix made  out of Lemmings  and Cannon Fodder, was  already
released  for several  computers  and consoles. You  should get it  if you like
sarcastic and nice styled comic-killing-games...

Another  release for  the Jaguar is  the conversion of the Falcon-RPG TOWERS 2.
It's nearly  an 1:1 conversion, but brings a new genre  to the Jag  because you
had not only one little RPG on this machine up to now.

Also a conversion from the STE/Falcon is the  space-shot'em'up ZERO 5 which was
improved in all things (better grafix and so one...)

With the game  WORLD TOUR RACING you  will get also another car-racing-game for
the Jag-CD. I haven't any informations about this game up to now and it will be
ready for release in a few weeks.

ATARI LYNX

Yes, here we have also 2 new games. At first a game called FAT BOBBY or so, but
I don't know anything about it. The second one is the longawaited conversion of
the Jaguar-shot'em'up RAIDEN. Should  we see also the game AvP sometimes on the
Lynx? ....
