comic-slideshow for the Falcon

This thing is a bit older but I wanted to review it in one of our issues.
You all have surely seen one of the LOGITRON-productions so far. They're making
games for Falcon  and ST/E, but  up to now they haven't matched it to release a
real  samsh-hit. But they have also released demos some  years ago. A very dull
one was the "Martians  Love Techno" demo. I hadn't  seen such a bad demo on the
Falcon before.
So I was very anxious  to see this production here, because at  first I thought
it can't be a good one.
So, as I have started the demo the always known Falcon-intro comes up and a bad
Logitron-logo appears on the screen.
Then the hero of the demo, called Kruston was  introduced, but in french and so
I must say that this demo is useless for all who don't understand this language
because the demo features masses of french sample-stuff, besides comic-pictures
including the text. Ok, it sounds very strange and you surely  will recognizise
that the demo is about shit and excrements but nothing more.
Because of this you will not understand the meaning of the demo right.
I will not give any ratings here, because the coding-stuff is primitive and the
other things like grafix are totally outdated. I hate system-font-things...
Hum. The frenchies will surely enjoy this demo but I think it's dull to produce
demos in a special language. But it seems as this is state of the art in France
because  there are many  demos with  french scroll-texts  or so. It is sad that
they don't try to entertain and inform the WHOLE scene with their stuff...
