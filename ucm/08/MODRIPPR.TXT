Yo! This is the first right ripper for the Falcon! You surely know the good old
ADRENALINE Ripper  which was based  on ST and  runs also on Falcon but  without
supporting any special module-formats or picture-formats which were used on the
Falcon. So you must use the XGRABBER to get pictures or other crude ways.
Now this problems are  history, because this new ripper  from Spain (cool eh?!)
offers you the possibility to ripp tons of module-formats and pictures.
The program is GEM-based and very easy to use. You have  to load the file which
you will ripp into  the program  and then you  can select for which formats the
prog  should search, you  can also use the  option to search for all modules in
the file, but this needs some more  time and if you know what the mod has for a
format you don't  need this option. And then the prog starts... mostly it finds
the modules.
The program supports the following formats:

modules: 4, 6 & 8 channel  modules, XM, MTM, 669, DMF, MGT, GTK, S3M, STM, NPK,
         FAR, PS16, OKTA, DTM, TCB, MDL and MED/OctaMED
         (it finds also ULT but cannot save them)
grafix : EGG, FLC  & FLI  animations, GIF, IFF, INDY, JPEG, PCX, PIX, PNT, TG1,
         TCP and IIM

It supports also the  ICE and ATOMIK packers (in the latest version) but if the
file are packed  with other crunchers you must depack them before with a multi-
depacker or so. I think their must  be more packers supportet, like SPEED-Pack,
FIRE-Pack  or the SENTRY packer  but we will see  what the autor will do in the
future...
By the pictures you have the problem that the program finds only the header but
not the end of the picture and so it saves a lot of shit together with the pic,
but it works.
I for myself would wish that the program can search also for the old ST-picture
formats like Degas Elite or NeoChrome Master.
It has also some problems by single modules but is  doesn't matter because only
a few of the included modules were used on the Falcon.
Hum... what  I should  say? The  program works  fine (I've  already ripped some
stuff) but it could contain some more features. I would like to see the ability
to ripp also ST-demos, so  sector-reading would be nice and also to possibility
to search for packed datas. But  also this  time the  prog is very  usefull for
ripping all the Falcon-demos off (Even if it  can't ripp modules  which use the
player by Flips / DNT Crew because this player changes the header of the mod.).
Because the  prog is for  free you should  get it and please send a postcard to
the autor!
