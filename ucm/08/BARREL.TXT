tested: Maxi-CD

YEAH! They're  back, after  nearly 4 years  of  silence  and  rumours. Ok, they
aren't the old  DeMo, the haven't much to do anymore with the old  Synthie-Pop-
style they had introduced in the Eighties.
Some guys might  say that they're  absolutely  shitty now but this can only say
the  normal poppers and the "pseudo-Depechies". A real fan like  me will follow
them and their new style up to the end.
You have surely  heard that  they aren't  a quartett  anymore. Alan Wilder  has
leaved  the band  but I  think this wasn't a great loss, the main thing is that
Dave (after his big drug-excesses) and Martin are still there.
Ok, you will sure  remember the last album called "Songs Of Faith And Devotion"
from the year 1993 and you know that they had changed their sound at that time.
This time  they're  sounding a bit  stranger  as in  1993. It  is a  consequent
further development  of this style. At  least on  this Maxi you  will not think
that this is DeMo. You will not hear the wellknown synthie-sounds anymore.
You will hear a more  industrial-like  sound with  many stretching-effects (you
have also problems  recognisize the  voice of Dave), guitar-sounds (like in the
good old "Route 66") and drivin' beats. I  like this new sound, even if I think
that their best  album was the "Violator". The best thing is that they're doing
what they want, no commercial shit  for the masses, only cool sounds for a very
little but faithful fan-community.

You will find the following songs on this CD:

1. Barrel Of A Gun
2. Painkiller
3. Barrel Of A Gun - Underground Soft Mix
4. Barrel Of A Gun - One Inch Punch Mix

The main-tune is good and remembers more to the 1993-album as the "Painkiller".
"Painkiller" is more in the style of the tracks which were released only at the
several maxi- and mix-CD's of the "Faith and Devotion"-album (like "I feel You"
or "Walking In My Shoes").
But anyway it is very cool music and when you call yourself a 100%-Depechie you
should buy this CD! It comes in  a very cool looking jewel-case and  brings you
more as 20 minutes new sound...
WATCH OUT FOR THEIR NEW ALBUM CALLED "ULTRA" which  will be  released in spring
this year. I think the name of this album is matching to their new sound...
Read more about this in  the next regular issue of UNDERCOVER, the mag from the
scene for the scene...
