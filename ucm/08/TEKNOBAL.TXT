After I have reviewed the great freeware-game IMPULSE for Issue 7 of Undercover
here comes another review of an Arkanoid-clone. This one is a bit older (it was
released in the year of 1995) but has good chances in a competition against the
IMPULSE-game.
TEKNOBALL was  created by  a french autor  which has  good contact to the demo-
scene and so this game must be technical state of the art.
I wouldn't loose any word about the game  itself. It's the same and I think you
have surely played such a game on any machine.
This is the unregistered version and features only 5 levels and only one music.
The final game will contain about 30 levels and different sound-tracks.
You  have  the usual  extras  like "next stage", "extra life", "magnetic" (this
means that all the balls on the playfield will come to your bat and so you cant
loose  them), "extra-ball" (each time you will get this extra  you'll get a new
ball on  the playfield  and when you're  a good player  you can have 10 or more
balls on  the playfield at  the same time...), "fire" (always  known) and loads
more...
After  finishing 5 stages  you must fight against a "Big Boss" like in the most
arcade-games. In level 5 this  is a very big ball, jumping around on the screen
and you should not touch him because you will lost a life if you will do this.
You must  shoot this ball and he will split  up in little balls... As a litttle
bonus for finishing  this stage  you will see a manga-girl after it and all the
other Boss-stages.
Ok, thats for the game and now as always a little look to the technical side.
The game runs  in true-color-mode. The grafix  in the menu, intro  and the game
itself  were mostly  raytraced  and nice  looking. Even  with many balls on the
screen the speed slows not down (like in IMPULSE).
The music is in techno-style (erm... you surely thought that =) and uses simple
ProTracker-modules  and 8-voice-modules. There  are also speech-samples and the
usual fx included and all in one the sound uses up to 14 voices...
The control  about the mouse is  okay but I must mention that you can't control
the  ball so good as in IMPULSE. Ok, the  collision is  pixel-oriented  but you
can't give  the ball a  good drive/spin while  smashing him  with the corner of
your bat and so sometimes (erm, very seldom) the  ball jumps always in the same
way up and down and you can't much do to correct his routes...
The motivation  is saved by a  saveable highscore and a load-option for loading
saved games. So you must not start at the beginners-level everytime.
That's all. All in one  it's a nice  game and Arkanoid-addicted gamblers should
register  for this game. Guys  which will only play sometimes  a game like this
can get this demo-version or should take the IMPULSE game, because it's free.
