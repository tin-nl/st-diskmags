what?    - album
style    - electronic-wave
producer - Silke Products / I.N.R.I. - Rec. 1995

This album of the No. 1-electronic-wave-band in Germany contains only very slow
and melancholic  songs. mOd means that the music which this band makes is total
primitive but I think he has never heard a song of this  band. This music isn't
boring or simple, there are great synthesizer-arrangements and acoustic guitars
build in and all in one  it sounds extreme spherical... The voice of the singer
is mainly very soft... Short: great stuff!

The contents of this album

 1 - Silke's Calling (intro)
 2 - To Protect And To Serve
 3 - The Union
 4 - The Letter
 5 - Frank
 6 - Leave Me Forever
 7 - The Devil's Teeth
 8 - Little Angel
 9 - Under Your Skin
10 - Silke's Calling
11 - (bonus track)

My personal  favourites are: "Silke's Calling", "To Protect And To Serve", "The
Union", "Little Angel" and "Under Your Skin" but  also all  the other songs are
very nice...
As I have said above, all the songs are very melodious, with great keyboard and
also guitar-sounds and  sometimes very  impressive singing. The texts are about
love and dying and if you're a labile one  you should not buy  this CD, because
it's the  right stuff to sit down  in a little dark corner to let roll down the
tears and if you're a bit  too depressive it can be that you will take a razor-
blade to cut your veins... Otherwise  this album is  very recommendable for all
the fans of electronic-wave...

TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE
-----------------------

She wrote me a letter, she knows what I mean
Translated the runes, she knows what I feel
But life can be a labyrinth
When you're alone.

We will be there
To protect and to serve
There's no reason to be scared
To protect and to serve
No one will be hurt.

So tell me your problems, tell me your life
You know you can trust me, I know what you feel
No explanations necessary
Just call out the name.

We will be there
To protect and to serve
There's no reason to be scared
To protect and to serve
No one will be hurt.

THE UNION
---------

You and me in a family
Never alone, no one's on the phone
You and me in a little house
Making love the whole day through.

The times we have been going through
Does it mean anything for me and you
The union for eternity
Does it mean anything for you and me
Now I'm all alone again
The frying pan's much too wide
The bed's too big
I haven't seen you for some weeks
And when you're on the phone
I'm so weak.

Why - oh why?
It's hard to belive but it's true
Oh why - oh why?
Alone in the crowd wihtout you.

Winter sadness - a dream in white
Lost union - a dream in black
Winter sadness - a dream in white
Lost union - a dream
Just a dream in black.

THE LETTER
----------

I'm writing a letter - a letter for you
For the last time - love me true.

Shouldn't we better stay on our own
Shouldn't we better stay alone.

I'm writing a letter - a letter to you
It's not easy, I'm leaving you.

You can remember me when you hear this song
You can remember me when I'm gone.

I'm writing a letter - a letter for you
For the last time - love me true.

Shouldn't we better stay on our own
Shouldn't we better stay alone.

I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you.

FRANK
-----

Another night in the kitchen with Frank
And the sound of his broken guitar
We are drunken like wild horses
I love you curt, I fall asleep.

Wonna die - watch me bleeding.

Another night in the car with Frank
And the sound of my broken voice
Another nightmare, another black dream
My skin is burning, I fall asleep.

Wonna die - watch me bleeding.

Another night in a hotel room
Frank is playing his broken guitar
Forgotten songs of a lost generation
My heart is burning, I fall asleep.

Wonna die - watch me bleeding.

LEAVE ME FOREVER
----------------

No way to run no way to hide
Living here in this cage
I can't leave the city 'cause I belong
To the boys of the band
Driving alone in a starless night
I could die for shame
There's no excuse, I've lost control
I love you so.

Leave me forever, get out of my life
Leave me forever before I lose my mind
I see you everyday in his arms
I see you everyday in his arms.

I've seen the rainbow in a blue blue sky
With a silent heart
And I've seen the abyss in an angel's eye
Wild at heart
I'm dead and buried in an ivory-tower
In a golden grave
I'm dead and buried for eternity
I'll be your slave.

THE DEVIL'S TEETH
-----------------

The devil's teeth laughing in the night
Of a pale moon content with blood
Darkness is our only friend in the kingdom of decay.

Here it comes again boy, you're lonely and paranoid
Who is the next one? Fuck you man!

Take your wings and fly above
The mountains of a dying planet
Discover the secrets of the flesh
No silent wishes anymore.

Here it comes again boy, you're lonely and paranoid
Whoe is the next one? Fuck you man!

Tell me would you ever pull the trigger
On a last trip to hell
Tell me would you ever pull the trigger
And the world is drowned in blood.

The devil's teeth laughing in the wind
The crying of a rising age
The secrets are unveiled, your dreams become real.

LITTLE ANGEL
------------

Under the linden, down in the park
There is a small light in the dark
Under the pale moon, down by the lake
There is a way to a secret place.

Under a red sky - blood on your wrist
Follow the runes "Sag mir wer Du bist"
Heavenly voices down by the sea
Singing "Tomorrow belongs to me".

Little angel dressed in white - the universe in your eyes
Can you hear my voice?
Can you halp me through the night? I am scared like a child
I've lost my innocence.

Little angel dressed in white with kaleidoscope-eyes
And a virgin smile 
There's a poison in my venes, do you love me in vain?
Why don't you touch me now?

Leaning on your shoulder the world is clear and bright
At the end of the night
On your shoulder everything's all right
Leaning on your shoulder.

UNDER YOUR SKIN
---------------

You're under my skin, your love in my venes
There's blood on the floor my love
I touch your lips, I know we can find
The end of the rainbow.

And when I die - and when I die
Nothing can tear us apart
And when I die - and when I die
I'll never leave you.

Your shadow in my mind - your heart in my heart
I've never touched you, girl
Wherever you are, whatever you do
I'll never let you go.

Don't turn around, don't turn around girl
In the night in the dark there's no return
Fly with me in a blue blue sky
Fly with me across the sea, my love.

I'm under your skin - nothing can tear us apart
I'm under your skin - alway inside you my love
I'm under sour skin.

SILKE'S CALLING
---------------

I was living in a dream
Before you kissed my bleeding lips
I pray to you, I'm on my knees
You were dying fo my sins
I've gone too far, I've lost control
I'm falling, I'm falling.

Silke's calling
Silke's calling.

I was living in a dream
Until you touched my bleeding heart
Your kingdom will be here on earth
Strong amd mighty - the new religion
I've gone too far, I've lost control
I'm falling - I'm falling.

Like a Phoenix from the flame
I was rising
Feeling strong and mighty
Like never before.

Silke's calling
Silke's calling.

is 19:51...)...
