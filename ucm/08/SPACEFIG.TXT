SPACE FIGHTER was done by the french scene-software house Frontier Software and
as  you all know this is the  commercial  part of  DUNE, in former times a very
active demo-band  on the ST. In  this game  you will notice that the makers are
from the  scene. So the whole  intro-sequence has  not only a very professional
touch, no you could think this is a demo, with many great grafix (by Mic), some
3D-effex and great sample-sound, even on the ST.
The meaning behind the game is very simple. Destroy! Nothing more. For this you
must fly through different  stages. In the  first one  you're  fighting against
enemie-fighters in the space. The enemies  are shooting with something like big
meteors on you and you should shot them because they're damaging your ship very
hard...
In the second stage you  must fly through a corridor and must destroy the power
core of this station. This thing is laying on the floor (it's your first job on
the planet-ground).
In the third part you must fly through a  generator-field and avoid many mines,
which are flying around between the generators.
In the last  stage you must fly through magnetic doors before the whole station
will explode.
So the game features also  something for your reflexes because it isn't easy to
fly through this fields.
So, the technical  side is very  stunning for  a ST-game. I haven't seen a game
with such  good grafix in the last time. The 3D-objects  in the game itself are
all fast and you don't see any jerking on the screen. All is smooth and fast.
The sound  is good, on  the STE/Falcon  the sound is enhanced and you will hear
a tracker-tune. On the ST you will hear chip-musix, but it's also a nice tune.
The control with the mouse is very simple. The only things you have to do is to
move it around for taking  aim of  the enemies  or control of  your ship and to
smash the button for fire.
But one thing  isn't good. The  4 stages  following again  and again and so the
motivation  flows away  when you have  seen all stages. And so it's boring when
you only have to shot and no other possibilities. This game has really no deep.
But for a little shoting-show it's alright. If you  like shot'em'up games which
haven't a deeper  meaning and  which are very  monotonous you can buy this game
without any care. Others  should get the demo at first, to look if this game is
right for their claims...
