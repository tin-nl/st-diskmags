Yep, this is the review of  the full  game. I have  already tested the  preview
for the UCM 6 (in german) and now I'm back.
ALIEN THING  is an  Alien Breed  clone for all  Atari-machines. Ok, it  doesn't
reach the obvious idol but it's good for a ST-game.
The main thing in this game is to kill aliens on a space-ship. It's like in the
most other shot'em'up games, you should not ask for a deeper meaning, only kill
and destroy... =)
Therefore you have different weapons  and you  must search for access-cards. On
each level  you will have to do a job, like repair some things or activate some
switches.
To solve this  jobs you must run again and again over the station and so you're
confronted  with many  aliens or  at least with  their eggs and also with their
acid. If they're  touching you or you  will get in contact with the acid you'll
die immediately.
Ok, enough about this. To the technics.
You see the whole scenario in 2D, from above. The grafix are ok for an ST-game,
even if the animations  aren't the best but from this perspective it isn't easy
to animate the  sprites. On the ST the scrolling isn't so fast and smooth as on
the STE or Falcon but it does his job.
The  presentation of  the game is  also ok, some  grafix about the story of the
game and so one.
You can hear some sampled sound and also some sound-tracks. 
The control of the game is ok, you can run around with keyboard or joystick.
The motivation  of the game is saved for long time because you have to complete
11  missions. The single stations are really  big and if you're  dying the game
will be  a bit harder, because  you must  start from the beginning of the level
and all the aliens are back on track, with opened doors... tricky... but so you
can smash them once more (eventually interesting for shot'em'up-cracks...)
Because the price of the game isn't too high (around 50 DM) you  should get it,
it's a good shot'em'up. Ok, for the Falcon it doesn't set any  grafic-standards
but it makes fun too.
So, get away, buy this game and kill the bad bad aliens!

Ups, as a little help, here are the level-codes for the game:

PARTY - WORK - LARD - WHEEE - HELLO - HARD - GOSH - NIGHT - PEN - RULER

Ok, and now blast them away!
