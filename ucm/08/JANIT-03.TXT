                         -------------------------

...but steel you can trust.

Epilogue:
Mr White  closes the  lid over  the red  button. The lid is  marked with 15. He
could not let him live. The world is not prepared for the Janitors. The Janitor
was not  prepared for the  world. Full  of powers  but still  a child. He cries
softly as he  opens one of the drawers to the big oak desk. He takes out a gun.
Just holds it  like a child holds a teddybear while he looks around in the huge
laboratory. This  is where his son was born and this is where his own life will
end. He puts  the barrel  in his  mouth  and don't  hesitate  as he  pulls  the
trigger. Blood, gore  and brain  flows from the back of his head and some of it
stains a  little glass  tube in  one of  the shelves. The  little embryo inside
don't react, unaware of his  makers death and his own destiny. The nightmare is
not over. Blood  trickles in a  small streams over the small sign at the bottom
of the tube, Janitor 30.
