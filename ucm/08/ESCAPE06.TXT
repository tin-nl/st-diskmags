pixel painting program for the Falcon by No of Escape


Originally I did not  had the motivation to write another article about Escape-
Paint. But due  the fact of its great improvements I'll try to give you a small
review of  this beta-version, which  will  be -surely- released  at the SiliCon
party. So, here we go...

Firstly there  are some big  changes  in the  appearance of the programm. As No
told me, the  GEM-boxes are  supposed to look really great now. Unfortunatly my
Falcon has only TOS 4.01, so there's no possibility for me to ckeck this out.
...
The Degas-magnify now emulates the way of painting in Crackart. That means that
you've got  the same  feeling like  drawing in  Crackart. Although Escape-Paint
runs in  Truecolor, you  have the  possibility of clicking on your right mouse-
button while staying with your brush on a pixel of your wish: the programm will
select  this color  in the palette. So  there are no  differences to a programm
that works in plane-mode, if you are painting with the magnify.
I don't know  if this function  will be integrated  in the Neochrome-magnify as
well, but  it would  be really great - even  if I don't  use this one... ;) The
Neo-magnify  has not changed  since the last version. Somehow you could not use
it in this beta-version.
...
In the new  version of Escape-Paint you may create pictures with a size of max.
999x999(!). A little  calculator is  telling you  how much  memory this picture
needs. If  you've got  less memory  than the  picture takes, you cannot execute
this option. That's  really great: the  programm will  never fuck-up because of
the picture  takes too  much memory, and  you can see by  yourself what  size a
picture may have that if fits in memory.
Whilst working on the picture you can scroll  the screen by  pressing ALTERNATE
and moving  the mouse. Unfortunately  No hasn't integrated a function that sets
the screen-solution to cinemascope, so the x-range is always at 320 pixels.
As he told me, it  is not possible to  change the solution to 384 pixels in one
of the  next versions  due to the  fact that he  would have to adjust the whole
bunch of functions to this screensize.
...
Juri of Newline  is now working  on a real  nice  toolbar. The GEM-look will be
kicked out soon.
...
As I heard recently, DynaCore of tSCc is now working on a load-/save-module for
Escape-Paint. It  will load and save all modules of the programm GEMVIEW, which
are about 40 (at least that's the amount of formats I can load with it...)
So Escape-Paint  will be  the painting-programm with the most possible picture-
formats loadable. (strange word, never saw it before... ;))
...
I guess that this are all  improvements... (surely I  have forgotten  some, but
look at  it by  yourself!!) You  can order the  latest issue of Escape-Paint at

So that's all for this review. Keep cool and have a nice day... Und immer sch”n
geschmeidig bleiben... ;)
