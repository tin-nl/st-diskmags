As I have received this preview-version I  was very surprised because up to now
I have nothing heard from a sequel. I have only heard from  a french game which
is very similar to  the first  part and called ALIEN BLAST, but this one is the
official follow-up.
This preview  is already  nice presented, with  many nice drawn grafix and cool
sound. Now there  are some nice looking menus and screens for the mission-check
and the biggest improvement you will recognizise by the in-game-grafix. All has
now a  touch of isometric  view. Ok, it's  still an over head view  game but it
looks much more plastic. The  sprites are  better animated  and you  must fight
against more different enemies. Not only aliens. You will find also some robots
and droids to kill. In the single levels you can find also  many cupboards with
some stuff like extra-life, weapons, ammo and so one in them.
You must  shot again all  the enemies and close doors, activate switches and so
one. So it's nearly the same as in the first part of the game.
Hum, I will not  write too much  here because  the game is very similar  to the
first part and has only some improvements (you have also a map).
If you don't have the first part  and you think about buying it just wait a few
weeks up to the release of this game here because it's much better as the first
one. You will have great  shot'em'up-action  and surely  many funny hours while
crushing the silly aliens...
This game is a must  for all  shot'em'up freax! The  final version will feature
8 different weapons (from machine-gun up to the laser) and much more stuff.
                                                                                {*f1
