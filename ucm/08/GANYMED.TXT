GANYMED is a  freeware-game from  the maker of such high-quality games like the
SPICE and  PACTHEM, but this  time it isn't a single production. It was thought
as bonus-game for the registered users of his shareware-games. Now I have taken
a look at this  game and  it's nice, but  it doesn't  reach the  quality of his
other games.
GANYMED is  a Asteroids-clone. You  always know  this game, I'm sure. So I will
not write anything about the concept behind this game.
The technical side  is much more  interesting. He  has worked again mostly with
rendered sprites. The  asteroids are nice animated. But this are the only high-
lights at the grafical side. Ok, you will see some true color stuff too but its
nothing in comparison with his other games.
You will hear  several sample-stuff and a good soundtrack but it's not special.
Only mediocre.
The control is ok, you can control it with pad, stick or keyboard. The last one
is the best for me.
To save the motivation the game includes also a saveable highscore-list.
But there  isn't more I  could write about  the game. It's good for the coffee-
break, but nothing more. But because it's free you can get it without any risk.
If you like little shot'em'up games you will surely play it with much fun. Guys
which are hard to  please can  test it but I don't  think they will it play for
more at one time.
