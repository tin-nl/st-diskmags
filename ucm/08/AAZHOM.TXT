AAZHOM KRYPHT is the second beat'em'up  for the Falcon after the Falcon-edition
of the game THE ULTIMATE ARENA. So the expectations are very big.
The french  company LOGITRON  which has released some lame demos for the Falcon
and also the game  SHEER AGONY, a nice grafix-adventure for STE and Falcon, has
now released this game. The single facts  are promising, so you can expect five
different fighters with loads of special-moves, different fighting-places, true
color  graphics with  animations in 50 fps and  you have the possibility to add
new fighters, grafics and musix by yourself. 
But now, as  I've got the  demo-version I was very disappointed. The whole game
looks  like public-domain-stuff. The menus and the presentation is shit and for
a game which will cost about 80 DM I think also the presentation must be better
as in PD-stuff.
The game itself brings you the promised true color  graphics but the animations
of the characters aren't the best I've seen up to now. The  perspective is shit
and the worst are the controls and the  collision-detection. Even if  there are
still some milimeters place between the fighters their knocking each other.
You  can play with two different  guys in this  demo but only on one place. The
demo should  break after  one minute of playing but the game runs also two mins
or more and if you're fast  enough in  beating your opponent you will return to
the menus and can play again.
But  the motivation will be lost very fast because your opponent will not fight
back, he's  standing around on the screen and you can knock him out without any
problems. So you will  not get a right view to the game and I'm not the man who
buys a game blind...
The sound is very technoing and nothing special.
The control is not the best, even with the JoyPad.
All in one forget it! For this money you can also buy the  ULTIMATE ARENA. This
game isn't so colour-full but  you can play  it much  better. And you will safe
some money for the next game...
Make a bow around this digital shit!
