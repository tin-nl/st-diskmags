           News from the UK                                                     {*f0

The UK is  not exactly  renouned for the activity of its ATARI scene but we are
here, beavering away doing all things atarian. So I reckon that the more active
ATARI countries  should know what goes on over here. So here is a brief list of
current projects in the UK that I am aware of.

Reservoir Gods
--------------
Mr Pink and  the crew are currently  working on a 'SPYHUNTER' type game for the
Falcon which is  due out the latter half of this year and features 32 levels of
driving and ramming madness. It will be there most graphic intensive game since
the truely classic 'Double Bobble 2000'.

NEW DEMO
--------
Tat of Avena  is currently trying to finish off his  latest demo which does not
have an  official title as yet, but considering the time it has taken so far it
should be good.

ST+
---
One of the babies of ATARI disk mag world has just been made Falcon compatible.
Although the interface is written in STOS this mag can certainly hold  its head
high as a quality publication.

EDDIE CAT
---------
Ed 'the cat' Cleavland  is currently working on 'DONKEY ISLAND' a parody of the
famous Lucas Arts series. Early screen shots look very impressive and  the game
has come a long way from the little bit of code I was shown a year ago. Fans of
graphic adventures watchout for this one. It'll certainly show that 'Day of the
Tentacle' should have been released for the ATARI machines.

FCU
---
( Blatent  little  plug ) The "Falcon  Compatiblity  Utility"  version  III-acc
(Remix 97) has  just  been  released on  an  unsuspecting  public. With  a  new
'version filter' option and 150  new  titles added to the database it is slowly
becoming an essential if you want to buy old ST software for use on a Falcon.

EEzi PC Maggie
--------------
The Maggie Team have turned their attentions to insulting PCs with this one off
special  issue filled  with joke reviews, views, and piccys it is definatly one
for the PC haters amoung you.

Tony Greenwood
--------------
That master  of STOS  basic continues  to churn out high quality games (some of
which  look more  like assembly  than STOS). It's  getting so that every time I
here  news a Tony  Greenwood release  is in there somewhere, and that is no bad
thing.

Well that about raps things up for now...
