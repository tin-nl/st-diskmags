released 1996 by SPV / Synthetic Symphony

This is  the "newest" EP  of the german  synthy/EBM-band  with seven unreleased
tracks which were written and recorded in the year 1990. When you read the year
of the production and remember to the band  which had "found" the  synthie-pop-
genre  and to their  album which they  had released  in the same year (you know
whom I mean... right, Depeche Mode) you surely can think how this album sounds.
Yeah, it's  brilliant  old-fashioned  synthie/electro-sound  and at first I had
thought that this are some  unknown songs by  Depeche Mode! Ok, it sounds a bit
harder and uses the  electronic  sound much  more consequent  but you will hear
similarities for sure...
Ok, you will find the following tracks on this EP:

1. Outthrow
2. The Brithness Of Metropolis
3. World In Commotion
4. I Know...
5. Black Trade
6. Thoughts
7. (secret track)

What should I say? The songs are  living on  driving beats  and the sometimes a
bit  strange  synthie-arrangements. Also  the voice  of the singer  is good and
remembers sometimes a bit to Dave Gahan of DeMo.
Short, great stuff and if you're  a fan of synthie-pop and the BLIND PASSENGERS
you should buy this mini-album because only so your collection is complete...
They have also a homepage in the Internet and you can surf to them by:

PASSENGERS (I have  seen them at first  in December last year life on the XMAS-
Festival in L.E.) and many of the other bands...
