Yep, here it is, the newest version of Kobold, the ultimate file-copier for all
Atari-machines. I think you have already heard of this great tool and many guys
using this program in  different versions. In  spite of it I will take a little
review of this  new version for all the guys which haven't seen this program up
to now.
The first  thing you will notice is the  tridi-look of the whole shell. Yep, it
looks much nicer than the older menu.
