                          The l!fe of a swapper
                          ---------------------

I'm starting this article in tradition of the old Delta Force maggies because I
really like the idea of putting EBM-songlyrics to the  beginning of an article.
Another  reason  for  such  a  beginning  is  my  empty  brain  that  lacks  of
inspiration.

Well, how  did I became a  swapper? It was in the old days before .tSCc. turned
into a pure  democrew. I was  always the one  who had the best contacts and the
latest stuff (which was compared to the present, old shit).
I really started  swapping on my ATARi 800 XL. I swapped mostly games with some
guys whose  names I can't  remember. Then  in 1989 I left the computer business
completly. In  december 1990 I bought an ATARi 1040 STE which I am  still using
(for example to write aricles like this!).

My first  contact was a  guy I knew  from school. He named himself ZiSS. Then I
called an old contact from my ATARi 800 XL times and  asked him if he knew some
guys who own an ST. He gave me one number. It was the number of ICEMAN.
And a bit later  we sent the first  parcels to each other. Later on I met a few
more guys  from the local ATARi user base. For example KLAUS D., SCY, DYNACORE,
ATLAN, TINO H. (a LAMER!), MAIK and some more I think.
In 1992 I got  contact with the Atari Demo Club in Koblenz. In the beginning we
always bought our  demos but  later on I got better contacts and we swapped the
shit. In 1993 I swapped a little while with the FALCON ST Corp. in Switzerland.
1994-1997. After  we  released  Dynabusters+ ('94), we  got many  letters  from
scene-people and so I got on contact with:

Cyberpunk/Germs, The  Masterboys/Germs (Funniest  letters ever! X-rated shYt!),
Metallinos/Vectronix,  Stratagem/Animal  Mine, Avenger/The  Blues Boys, Marcer/
ELiTE, Matt/STAX, Parabola, Tronic/Effect, The  Beast/Typhoon, Moondog/tnb  and
TAM/T.O.Y.S.

With the last six guys I'm still in swapping contact in a regular basis. Let us
now look how a week of a swapper can look like.

Saturday:

   till 12:00 sleeping
12:00 - 13:00 eating
13:00 - 14:00 having a bath
14:00 - 15:00 lack of motivation... so watching TV...
15:00 - 16:00 made the first parcel. It's for Tronic with 5 disks.
16:00 - 17:00 finished the 2nd parcel for parabola with 8 disks.
17:00 - 18:00 too much. having a break.
18:00 - 19:00 chill out with ambient music
19:00 - 20:00 watching TV
20:00 - end   going out or something else...

Sunday:

   till 12:00 sleeping
13:00 - 16:00 made another 2 parcels. One for The Beast with 10 discs
              and one for Moondog with 10 disks. Shit, disks get rare.
16:00 - 18:00 I kicked my ass and made the final parcels for TAM and
              Matt. Shit, the whole day sucked up by doing parcels.

Monday:

16:00 - 16:20 taking 6 parcels to the post. costs 50.-- DM!

Let's  stop this  here. As a  swapper you often ask yourself  why you are doing
what you  are doing. You  often think  about stopping all activities. You think
it's no use to swap any longer on a dead system.
It's expensive, you  mostly don't have the time to do such actions like written
down above  and you don't  get any acknowledgement for your work. But just when
you want to throw the pencil in the corner you think that...someone must do it.
Swappers  are the  ones who  keep the  DATAFLOW alive (As long as there is some
DATA for the FLOW :-).

At this  point I want  to greet all  my contacts from the present and the past.
Some of them will never read this (I'm sure) but it's nostalgia...
[Wenn hier einer lacht, der kriegt gescheuert!]

This article  is dedicated  to all swappers who are still out there doing their
job. My form of ACKNOWLEDGEMENT for their work. Never stop! (242)

Next time we  will have a  look at the lifes of the coders, musicians, gfx-men,
sysops, crackers and more. C u.

I'm out.
