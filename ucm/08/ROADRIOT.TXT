Hum... here  it is, the  first commercial  car-racing-game for the Falcon but I
must say  that I  had expected  much much more... But  I will not  start at the
middle...
ROAD RIOT 4WD is  a conversion of  an ATARI-coin-up  of 1991. It was originally
produced  by ATARI but never released by them. The british software-house 16/32
SYSTEMS has taken over the rights of this game and they have released this game
for the Falcon about 2 years ago...
In the game you have to drive around with your buggy on eleven different tracks
and you must fight against another team (they are three). All  what you have to
do is to drive the tracks, to finish them  to win the series  championship. The
other vehicles will obviously try to stop your run to the finish and so they're
shooting  and smashing against your car. You  can ofcourse  shoot back and slow
down the other cars if you will hit them.
The several tracks represent different nations  and so you're driving in Arabia
against a scheich, in the Alpes against  a wife with big tits (for the germans:
sie heižt "Helga Grossenbergen" ...), in Africa against a mercenary-captain and
so one (in Las Vegas your opponent is Elvis...).
So, this is the point for changing to the technical  side. At first the grafix.
They aren't standard for the Falcon (I would  say that you can release such gfx
on the old Amiga 500... :-( ... There are  some digitzed animations but because
of the low resolution of the screen and the low frame-rate they're looking very
shitty. The only funny things are  the opponent-pictures... very crazy, even if
there were only a few colors used to paint them. The sprites in the game aren't
good animated. There  are  only  a few  zoom-steps. The same for the objects on
the border of  the tracks. The  animations of  explosions or  turn-overs aren't
very detailed, only three or four steps I think.
The music is very crazy. You have  to the single tracks totaly different musics
which are matching to the scene. They're sometimes very silly... great!
The FX I must not mention here...
Ok, but this  game has a very big handicap! You can't  play it! It is too fast!
You can't control your  buggy right. You're  crashing 10 times in a minute into
the obstacles. They and the curves appearing to fast on  the screen, you surely
knew the effect: you must drive about 150 km/h in the fog on an unknown street!
This game  isn't playable for  me! You will surely be frustrated after three or
four rounds and you will be very angry if you have bought the game...
As I have said above the only funny things are the dull musics, nothing more.
Just save your money and wait for other games...
