                         ---------------------------

Yep, here  it is, the  first  update  of the  german scene-report. We  had some
little changes in the last few months and so I must update this list.
If you have followed all the news in the last issues of the UCM you will wonder
why the  groups ABSENCE, AVENA & INTER  were still mentioned here but they have
not finally finished their ATARI-activities and so I will count them again...
But finally I have  removed a  lot of bands  and I have decided to  count bands
only if they have released  something since  January 1996. So you will see that
the list is very short now... but I think we should remove the pink glasses and
accept that the german scene is dying...
I have also the words alive and active new defined. ACTIVE means that they have
released something in the last half year or a new release is in preparation and
ALIVE means that their last production isn't older as one year.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSENCE / INDEPENDENT

You all know the rumours  about their  change to the  PC and so I don't know if
this is the final state. We will see if something new will be released by them.
If not the rumours are right and we can delete this group from the list.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Bull, Front 6, Mr. Coke, Stallion, The Avatar, The Innovator
system      - only Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADM TEAM

Even if they  have stopped their  magazine I will  count them here because they
were one of the organizers of the SILICON  party this year. But I don't know if
they will release more mag or demo-stuff.

scene-state - ALIVE
members     - Tinosoft, Trantor
system      - only Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANIMAL MINE / INDEPENDENT

At first I have thought that we will never hear something again from them becoz
they're working since more as 2 years on their final GREAT STUFF COMPIL.
But now they have released  a SID SOUND COMPIL at the end of  the last year and
so they're still in this list.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Domm, MC, Sethos, Stratagem, Titan (...?)
system      - ST and Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVENA

This group  will change  mainly to the  PC in the next  time. At least the most
german  members will do this. I don't  know if the last few  Atari-members will
hold the  name AVENA  alive on the Falcon. Only one thing is save this time. We
will see another Falcon-demo by them, or at least by Tat, their british member.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - A -t-, Boris, Fried, Jet, Metallix, Tat, Thyroxin, Tommi
system      - Falcon and ST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHECKPOINT

This group has worked together with ESCAPE to release  a new music-demo for the
Falcon and I have  heard that more productions will come this  year, so they're
definitve alive and active.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - 505, Defjam, Joe Cool, Noname
system      - ST only
products    - demos
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREAM

I don't  know if new demos will  come from them and so I have counted them only
as alive. I haven't heard  of new projects up to now and I hope that I must not
remove them from the list...

scene-state - ALIVE
members     - Abyss, A.-t-, Candyman, Tao 
system      - ST and Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CRUOR

Of this band I haven't heard something since many months. I only know that they
are busy with their  game. I don't know  if new demo-stuff  will come from them
and so I count them only as alive.

scene-state - ALIVE
members     - Raving Mad, Zweckform
system      - Falcon only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ESCAPE

After the rumours about a joining of the THERAPY-member Coke are disproved this
is more a  one-man-group, because all the coding- and  grafix-stuff was done by
No and this time he's busy with his Escape-Paint. But new demo-stuff will  come
after the release of the "Modulation"-Musicdemo in cooperation with CHECKPOINT.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - No, Shifter (?)
system      - Falcon only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTER / INDEPENDENT

This group is still alive and also active but they will change to the PC in the
near future, I think completely. I have heard that they're preparing some demo-
stuff for  the SILIcon. Questor  is working  also for ANIMAL MINE this time. It
could be that he will the only member which will stay on the Atari :(

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Lucky of ST, Nightmare, Questor, Pater Michael, Samurai, Zonk
system      - Falcon only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPIRITS

I have heard that they're working more on PC this time. They have converted the
EWIGKEIT-screen  to the PC and will  release this screen at the Easter-parties.
I know that Seb has coded some great effex  also for the Falcon and he has also
updated the Falcon-version  of "Ewigkeit". I don't know if there  will come new
Atari-releases.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Connor, Seboz 
system      - Falcon only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAX

This compact-group  is still  here. But they have  slowed down the releasing of
new demo-disx. But it can be that they will comeback with other stuff as simple
compacts this year... Hopefully this are not only rumours...

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Bod, Matt, Mike, Tyan
system      - ST only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE NAUGHTY BYTES

Yup, we are still here as you can see with this new issue of the UCM. But there
isn't much left of our  group, only 2 (3) active members. But we will bring you
more stuff this year!

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Drizzt, FXL, Flash (collaborating artist) Gary, Lot, Moondog
system      - ST and Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THERAPY

This group is also still here and they're preparing a new demo for the SILIcon.
The problem  of this guys is that they release their stuff only  on parties and
so you will hear nothing from them for months... 

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Coke, Dale, Dodger, Goldy, Jailbird, Nohow
system      - Falcon only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SIRIUS CYBERNETICS CORP.

This group is very active  and I think  it's the best german group today. Since
our ex-artist m.O.d. has joined the band  they're complete. Besides their high-
quality  module-compils  they releasing  again and again some interesting stuff
and  so you will  see the  first  Falcon-only-demo by  them in  the next weeks,
because they preparing a 96Kdemo for the SILIcon.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Dynacore, Llama, MC Laser, m.O.d., Scy
system      - ST and Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TUMULT

It was very  calm around this  elite-compact-group. I haven't seen new compact-
disx since many months but now they're back with their first crack on the Atari
computers and they will bring more compacts in the future.

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Captain Future, HD Crash, Immortality, Vince Clotho
system      - ST only
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VECTRONIX

This group  is still  here and they  will not stop  in the near future, this is
very safe. 

scene-state - ACTIVE
members     - Dumpfbacke, Hardball, Jabba, Lewd, Lonsdale, Metallinos, Moonfall
              Twilight
system      - ST and Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, as  I have  removed all  the  zombie-bands  and sleeping groups which will
never come  out of  their sleep  anymore, this list  is very short. It could be
that I must  remove again some  bands in the next months. If some guys will say
that it is dull to remove their names from the list so I must say that we don't
need pseudo-bands in  the scene, because only from the presence of some guys we
don't have anything. If you will  release something I will list you again here,
be  sure, but if you think  you must been listed because of releases some years
go away...
If you  have any new informations about the listed groups or you have founded a
new band  and if  you have  released something  please  write  us  or send us a
message. It would be nice if you could  help us. We aren't perfect and so don't
fuck us if we  have some errors in here but  we can't hold contact to each band
in Germany, even  if we would  do this. But it  is a question of time and money
and so we hope to get your help wihtout a special-demand...
We're  searching especially  informations  about the current state of THE CHAOS
ENGINE, RISK, MUGWUMPS, AURA (!), NEW TREND, NPG and DNS. So  if you're reading
this please get in touch with us! You can also send an Email to m.O.d. / .tSCc.
because he's working very close together with us...

His Email-add: jur96mct@studserv.uni-leipzig.de

So leave us a message  in which you explain what's going on with your group and
if the group is still alive or dead as the most other sleeping bands... Thanx!
