what?    - EP
style    - electronic-wave
producer - Silke Products / I.N.R.I. - Rec. 1996

This little mini-album was  released at the end  of the last year  and contains
some  new mixes  of "Waste Of Time" (The  song was  released  on  the "Northern
Lights" album.) and some  previous unreleased  songs. This  time the  songs are
about drugs and love. They are very pessimistic ("H Is Stronger Than Love") but
I think they're right with their opinion...

The contents of this mini-album

1 - Waste Of Time - extended new version
2 - Waste Of Time - video edit
3 - H Is Stronger Than Love
4 - Quiet Days In B.C.
5 - Flash In My Veins
6 - Waste Of Time - acoustic

The songs on this album aren't such melancholic as the ones on the "Protect..."
album (except "Flash In My Veins"). It's just very melodious  synth-pop, in the
most songs you can hear acoustic-guitars beside the spheric keyboard-sounds and
the songs living of the great voice of the singer Felix Flaucher...
Because this EP had  the price of a  simple Maxi-CD you should search for it in
your record-shop, it's really worth hearing.

the lyrics to only one song... (sorry)

H IS STRONGER THAN LOVE
-----------------------

Yesterday, I straightened up my room
There I found a picture of you
Between some old letters
I'd like to know what you're doing now
I'd like to know if I see you again.

I didn't hear anything about you for some years
Then there was a letter in my mailbox
You were in Jail
They got you with some heroin.

Now you say you'll start a new life
Now you say you'll never go back again.

From now on I received a letter every day
I spent my nights to answer you
I said: don't be so sure.
There's nothing you can learn in jail
And it's so easy to leave the old ways.

We've been together for so long
But I know that H is stronger than love.

A new town, new friends a new job
A new love or maybe you can go back to school again
You need something to fill the emptyness
Something to fill the emptyness.

This was the last letter I received
I think you are back in the streets
Maybe one day you'll write again
Or maybe you'll die with a needle in your arm
We've been together for so long
But I know that H is stronger than love.

...

(the part from "...A new town..." up to "...emptyness..." isn't included on the
CD... I've taken over the lyrics from the magazine ORKUS...)

It wasn't easy to hear  out the lyrics  from the songs. They weren't printed in
the booklet of the CD and the voice was often a bit distorted or overlayed...
So I have decided to type in only this song, because I wouldn't write something
false...
