produced by I.N.R.I. Records / Discordia 1994

This EP was done by the guys which are standing also  for SILKE BISCHOFF and so
you surely will know what  kind of music  CRYSTAL LAKE perform... yes, its very
melancholic romantic-wave. It doesn't contain so many synthesizer-sounds as the
SILKE BISCHOFF productions  and you will  hear mainly acoustic guitars and also
electric violins. So the songs sounding like some of  the calm songs of the new
SILKE BISCHOFF EP "Waste Of Time" or older SB-stuff. At  first you  will wonder
about  the voice of  the singer which  sometimes sounds a bit like of a drunken
man. It's the voice of Peter  Field and he has also sang the  song "Flash In My
Veins" of the  mentiones SB-EP. When  you hear very  carefully to the songs you
will also  recognisize the  voice of  Felix Flaucher, the singer  of SB, in the
background....

You will find the following songs on the CD:

1. Suffer In Silence
2. Labyrinth
3. The Fight
4. Deep In The Haze
5. With You
6. Violent Vision Blue
7. Merry - Go - Round

Hum. I like nearly all songs. Only the 4th sounds a bit strange. 
All in one  it's a good  EP with very  slow songs and  if you're a fan of SILKE
BISCHOFF you should get this album of their beside-projekt CRYSTAL LAKE.
At first I have thought that this thing was also a SB-album as Eva (thanx!) has
lend me the CD, because it  sounds like them  and also the artwork of the whole
cover looks very similar.
This time I haven't the songs again, because they were not printed in the book.
Last word: just get this EP... it's a nice piece of music.
