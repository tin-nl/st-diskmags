+ 1. Introduction +
 +---------------+

   Nearly one year ago two great parties took place:

   -> Mekka'96 (29th to 31st of march):

      Mekka was held  the first time in 1996  and was a great success.  Over
      300 attenders from different countries joined the event. Before Mekka,
      there was no real  party for the german pc demo  scene in our country.

   -> Symposium'96 (5th to 8th of april):

      Symposium took place  the 9th time  and about  650 attenders  from all
      over Europe came to be part of this special event.  The multi-platform
      party got  a good reputation  cause it is a  scene party  organized by
      scene people.

   At eastern 1997 these both parties will be combined  - not competing like
   last year - to provide you even more fun, entertainment and partyfeeling.

   It does not matter what kind of computers you like  - we will support all
   platform and  most of them  will be represented by  well known and famous
   demo groups for sure.

              - PC - Amiga - C64 - Atari Falcon - Acorn RISC PCs -

   This time Symposium/Mekka'97 will be an event not to miss - and remember:

                     If you don't come... it's your fault!

   -> Visit our IRC channel  #sym97  to get the latest news and information.

      connected to the IRC.  Our equipment will hopefully provide a fast and
      save party network all 72 hours. See chapter 5 for more details.

   -> Network: we are selling network equipment like NE2000 network cards or
      ethernet cables and connectors for a fair price.

   -> We will present all compos  on a big screen of 6 * 4 squaremeters  and
      a powerfull Dolby Surround music system.

   -> 100% public voting on all compos for everybody at the partyplace.

   -> There will be a  quiet place for you to sleep  if you decide not to do
      this in front of your computer or under the table ;)

   -> Food: We will sell drinks (Coke,Water) and cold snacks like (Snickers,
      Chips, etc.) for a cheap price.  We can not provide  warm food (sorry)
      and the shops in the city have only opened on Saturday from 09:00am to
      04:00pm (that's only 7 hours during the hole party!) but you will find
      McDonald's and  some nice  restaurants in the city.  Of course you can
      bring your own food with you.

   -> Every night there will be a mind blasting laser show.

   -> Live performances  on the stage by  Noisedrift, Ronny/Teklords and the
      FX Performer and Noodles/Phantasm.

   -> Flake/TRSI, the author  of the  well known  Amiga  anti-virus  program
      VirusWorkshop  will hold  a small  conference  giving  details  on the
      latest virus techniques  which are becoming  more evil and destructive
      than ever before.

   -> The German BeBox Users Group (DeBUG) will also meet with us. We try to
      make room  for a presentation  in the  Be Demo Tour  series which took
      place also on The Party VI last X-Mas.

   -> Many  other  features of  which we are not able or not willing to tell
      you yet.

   Now that we're organizing this party, you might think that all you can do
   is  visiting  it.  This is wrong:  We give you the one and only chance to
   produce  yourself.   If you want to give a lecture on something or if you
   have  another  idea of enriching the event, you're very welcome to do so.
   We would like you to contact someone of us as soon as possible, though.

 +------------+
+  5. Network  +
 +------------+

   A LAN (Local Area Network) with several servers will be on the Party. The

   Every table gets  an own network cable  with a terminator  (BNC 10-BASE-2
   Thin-Ethernet). We will support the following frames:

   -> Ethernet IEEE 802.2 with iPX

   -> Ethernet IEEE 802.3 with iPX

   -> Ethernet Type II    with iPX & TCP/iP

   Please note, that we DO NOT SUPPORT NeuBEUI, DLC or DEC-NET!

   That's what  you need to  connect yourself  to the party  network and its
   party server:

   -> An ethernet cable  and a T-Connector (we do NOT support  Twisted Pair,
      unless you bring your own hub with you ;)

   -> A Novell NDS  (Netware Directory Services)  client OR  you can  get an
      instant client from the net-crew.

   -> For the instant client  you will need the  ODI Driver for your Network
      adapter.  This client does NOT run with Windows 95  even if Windows 95
      includes it's own ODI Driver.

   We are  selling network  equipment like  NE2000 network  cards,  ethernet
   cables and connectors for a fair price.

   If you want  to spread your releases  over the network you can  share the
   files with Windows 95/NT/WfW  or get a permission by the  net-crew to put
   them on the Party-Server.

   Our network is supported by (alphabetical order):

   -> Novell

   -> Proteon

   -> Silicon Graphics
