Yep, we're  still not  alone and this is fine... I've received more mags in the
last  days. This aren't only scene-magazines, no  there are  many other maggies
around, they're coming mostly from U.K...

            MAGGIE ISSUE 22                                                     {*f0

released in January 1997 by the Maggie Team / Reservoir Gods
the mag runs also on Falcon

This is  the latest issue of one of the oldest still alive disk-mags on the ST.
This time they haven't included an intro  but the mag itself contains many very
interesting news and articles again.
So they have included reviews of new Jaguar-games, games for ST and Falcon incl
some very cool previews (e.g. a Monkey Island clone  which looks  great!), many
shareware-things, of the new WebSpace, many demos and intros  for Falcon and ST
and the always known things like craptalk and and loads of interviews.
You can find  also new programming-tips  and a complete diskmag-encyclopedia in
this issue.
Overall there are more than 80 articles included and so you need some hourse to
read them all. As I  have said  above the mag  contains this  time no intro and
this is a bit sad after the great intro of issue 21 by Tat of Avena...
But who cares. The mag does his job to entertain the reader once more very good
and I'm waiting for the next issue which will be released in April this year.
Because there weren't any changes  on the menu (the  new one by Tat) and viewer
(the old one by the Delta Force) I will not write more bulshit here...
If you're searching for new diskmags just get this one! You  can download it in
many different  boxes, also from our own BBS (The Junction) and also every good
swapper will surely stock this mag in his collection...

released in December 1996 by Dave Hollis
runs only with Backward on the Falcon

Up to now I haven't heard about this magazine  and so I was surprised as in the
early days of January the newest issue plops into my mailbox...
I put the disk into my ST and switched the machine on and after some info-pages
I reached the intro... Erm... what's  this? Besides  some  Xmas-grafix  you can
hear a mad Xmas-module and see a scroller with senseless informations. Than the
main-menu appears  on the screen. You can see  winter-grafix and a  list of the
articles on the left side. You don't hear  any music, only some  sampled voices
by loading or leaving an article.
The viewer  is very  blind but  there are some grafix between the text. You can
take many options like font-change, color/palette-change and print-option.
The mag is controlled by a mix made of mouse and keyboard. The scrolling of the
viewer isn't the best but does his job.
The mag itself contains about 70 articles from all areas, like software-reviews
and  previews, news, entertainment, consoles and  sci-fi, also  for  everyone a
little  bit. This  mag isn't  a scene-mag. It  contains  nearly no informations
about  new demos or  news of the  scene. It is a  mag for the "ordinary" Atari-
users.
The mag  appears every  month and  this is  very seldom  on the Atari. The most
magazines  need at least two or three months from  one to the other issue. This
means also that the mag must be very actual, but it isn't
Hum, if you need every month new informations (even if they are very UK-related
and not too extended) you should get this magazine.
I for myself don't  like the menu. It is a bit too childish in my eyes but that
is my private view....
                                                                                {*f1
