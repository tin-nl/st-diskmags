   NEW COMPACT-DISX FOR YOUR ST/STE                                             {*f0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum, even if the most compact-groups have stopped there work on the ST/STE I've
got some new CD's in the last weeks. In one point I was  very surprised because
there is a old group back in the business... ANIMAL MINE! Yes, you're right!
This time  it's only a  simple SID-Sound-Compile  but I hope that there will be
more and better stuff in the next time...

                   - INDUSTRIALLY SAFE DEMO DISK # 33 -
                 ----------------------------------------

done by  : EFFECT / UK
released : 26.11.1996
system   : ST / STE
credits  : coding      - Tronic of Effect
           compiled by - Tronic of Effect
           grafix      - Blaze of Effect
           musix       - Babydee of Effect (intro STE)
                       - Tao of Cream (menu)

Yep, after long  long times (the last one was done in July '96) here is another
compact-disk made by Tronic and the other chaps of EFFECT. I was very surprised
as I had read that  Tronic is back  again, because  I had heard that he is very
busy with his PC.
Ok, the intro  is the always known scroll-thing, this time without music on the
ST, only for the STE-machines. The  intro is nice styled but doesn't  bring any
effect to mention here. The menu itself is the old one  ASCII-thing with a nice
SID-music by Tao. This time there aren't many intros included.
You can choose the two intros for  Undercover 6 (for ST/E and Falcon), a little
demo by  DEEZ of MIND DESIGN (reviewed in UCM 7) which doesn't run (4 bombs) on
my STFM and a  collection of  C64-Sidsounds (44) incl. the STE and  Falcon-SID-
player by Cream. There is also a  list of all  INDUSTRIALLY SAFE DISX included.
You can see, the stuff  isn't very new or brainblasting (esp. the intros of our
magazine 6 :-) and  so this disk is  only recommendable for collectors and also
swappers...
                                                                                {*f1

                       --------------------------------

done by  : ANIMAL MINE / Germany
released : 28.12.1996
system   : STE and Falcon only

Hum, last week I recevied a parcel by  MC Laser of TSCC and  was very surprised
as I have found a disk with the inscription AM SIDCOMPIL # 1 in it. Hum, what's
this? I slamed the disk into my good old ST and switched  the machine on... but
only the TSCC-bootsector  appears on the screen, no intro. On the desk I loaded
the readme-file and I was right... ANIMAL MINE are back on the CD-market with a
compil of C64-Sid-tunes. You can find 114 sounds on the disk including the SID-
player by Cream... but nothing more.
Ok, it's a nice idea to collect this sounds on compact-disx because so you have
all the little thingies on one separate disk. But I hope that they will include
an intro next time, because the name AM stands for state-of-the-art-compacts on
the ST/E and  so it isn't  good for the image to release CD's without any intro
or menu, at least this is my opinion...
This disk  is only  interesting  for all fans of C64-SID-sounds and collectors,
because here are many sounds included which I haven't seen on other collections
(e.g. Effect's ISDD # 33... look above) before.
                                                                                {*f1

At last I have an older compact-disk for you reviewed...

                            - ST COLLECTION # 9 -
                          -------------------------
                        
done by  : TYPHOON / France
released : 04/96 (I know, it's a "little bit" older :(
system   : ST/E and Falcon
credits  : coding      - The Beast of Typhoon
           compiled by - The Beast of Typhoon

As I  have mentioned above this compact-disk "a bit" older  but I have reviewed
it because I  think that the  compacts of this guys were not spreaded very well
over Europe and so many of you haven't heard of them up to now.
They're packing very different things to  their CD's, like PD-tools, games, and
of course demos  and intros. This time you can also look at some Falcon-screens
and the most stuff on this disk was released on the Aggressive Party 2.
The intro of this compact is coded with the DCK... erm... I will not write more
about it, but it contains a nice logo...
The menu is coded  in GFA and fully mouse-controlled. So you can read something
about the stuff on this disk before  loading it. But in the menu you don't hear
any sound and this isn't good...
But the stuff is good  selected and the best  thing on this disk is the PD-game
SNACMAN, a great Pacman-clone for ST/E...
All in one  this compacts  aren't bad. The  menu is nice but should be improved
much more. But one thing I must mention: I don't know if this compact-series is
still alive...
                                                                                {*f1
