Because  I haven't many  informations  about this  project but  I was asked for
contacting german ST-coders I have written this little advert. Its for all, not
only for the germans!

The  problem is  that the ST KNIGHTS, a little  demogroup  on the french island
REUNION, near Madagascar in the Indic, want do another megademo for the ST.

For this they're  searching guys which want do guestscreens for this demo. I've
only heard that the  mainmenu (in style of the Union Demo) is already finished.
Further I've heard that  groups like HOLOCAUST and .tSCc. will  perhaps prepare
a screen for this demo.

So, if you're interested in making a screen for this demo, so get in touch with
JACE of ST KNIGHTS. Here is his address:

Snail mail: Laurent FARGUES
            3, rue Romain Rolland - Appt 11
            Le Moufia
            97490 Sainte Clothide
            FRANCE

E-mail    : jace.stk@runnet.com

So be cool  and get in touch with him! We need a  new megademo in the old style
on the ST/E! I almost can't remember to  the times of the  big megademos on the
ST and so  it would be  very cool if  we could see a new one! The megademos are
a dying out genre and so please help to save this kind of demos!
