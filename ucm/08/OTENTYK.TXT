This demo I had  found while a Internet-session together with  m.O.d. of .tSCc.
and I was surprised, because I haven't heard of it up to now.
At  home I depacked the  files and started the demo, in hope to see some brain-
and chip-blasting things.
Hum, at first an Adrenaline-vector-logo was turning  around on the screen and a
music in style of the E.K.O. and E.X.A.-demos starts to  play. The screen turns
green and a black box opens with a little zooming presents-logo by Nytrik / HDX
and after this the title-picture, a rendered one, appears on the screen.
The name O-...-demo seems to be an attempt to remember to the good old "O-..."-
demos by several french groups on the ST some years ago. You surely remember to
the "O-Demo" (by Oxygene), "Flip-O" (by Oxygene & Diamond Design) & "Calimer-O"
(by Oxygene & MJJ Prod) and this were really great demos with neat  effects and
good design ("Flip-O" ... the best designed demo on the ST so far).
And so I was very anxious to see this demo... Hum, after  a nice transition  to
the next effect, I was very  disappointed to  see only very little line-vectors
with something like a mist-effect and a  pixeled woman-head on the screen. Also
the next screen isn't state of the art. I brings something like design and in a
little box you will see very fast shadebobs (in masses) and a zoomed plasma.
Then another picture with a mountain-motive appears on  the screen and you will
see a line of bobs with glas-effect going over the pic.
After this you will see  some 3D-objects, like  cars and  a space-ship but they
aren't very upsetting.
Then the nicest effect is coming  up, this are delayed  gouraud-shaded vectors,
but here the music stops  to play (at least  on my machine) and  after this the
music plays further and a plasma-transition the demo stops...
Hmmm... This demo is in all areas not the  best, the two musics  aren't good in
my ears (at first some irrelevant noises and  then a stupid  techno-track). The
grafix were only  mediocre and  also the  design. The code... hum... I will not
mention here...
This demo  is only interesting for swappers and collectors. If you're searching
for  brainblasting things  with tons of  effecs you should watch  out for other
things...
