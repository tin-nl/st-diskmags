produced by Strange Ways Records
released 1995

This album  is a  collection of several  unreleased tracks, mixes  and versions
taken from divers singles and  EP's and gives  you a great cross section of the
work of this cool  german electronic  wave band. Besides the singles a complete
unreleased ep called "Bruder Kosmonaut" is included here with 5 new tracks from
the year  1995. The  most of you will surely knew this band because their older
tracks "The Sparrows And  The Nightingales" and "It's Not Too Late" were played
in the most disco's all around the world when the "dark corner" opens and songs
of Depeche Mode, Sisters Of Mercy  and And One  were played. They are very cool
"ear-worms" and even if they (WOLFSHEIM) mean "You will never love us" you will
like this band and their work if you  have ever  heard and danced  to the great
synthie-sounds of this two songs...

The most  of these songs  were extreme melodical and  also very melancholic, at
least the voice of the singer sounds often very sad and if you like the work of
other  bands which  create  such a  depressive  synthie- and electro-sound like
DE/VISION or also RAVENOUS you should urgent  buy this album, and by the way is
this album also something like a best-of...
But it's a pity that only a few lyrics are printed  in the booklet. So there is
only one  text of the "Bruder Kosmonaut" Ep  included and  the  lyrics  of "The
Sparrows..." is only in a censored version printed... I have completed the last
one (many words  were overprinted in the booklet but it was easy to fill up the
gaps...).

lyrics

YOUTH AND GREED
---------------

She once was 17 but she never fell in love
Because she never felt the same
Like the other ones at school
Like all the other boys and girls around.

Misery - talk to me
Youth and greed - walk with me.

Now she's 33 but there isn't anything
That really changed in her life
Not a moment not a while
She is married, bore a child
Growing old, growing older all the time
And she cries.

A whining sound slips from her mouth
Trapped in here and no way out.

Wait a while - wait a while
Mommy's pills will bring you to the other side.

Wait a while - wait a while
Daddy's razor-blades will make you feel so fine.

THE SPARROWS AND THE NIGHTINGALES (completed words in [])
---------------------------------

How long have you been [free]
In this world of hate and greed
It is [black] or is it white
Let's find another [compromise]
And our [view] standing still
We're [dancing] in the spotlight
Where's the leader who leads me
I'm still waiting
Leaving home
And [god] is on your side
Dividing sparrows from the nightingales
Watching all the time
Dividing water from the burning fire...
[ ]
Leave a light on in the night for me
That [I can find] you
[ ] when we both where young an
Reckless and so curious
Now you're hiding from your child...
A [ ] day's dawning.
[ ] that you felt [ ] sometimes
And [god] is on your side
Dividing cruelty from [tenderness]
Watching all the time
Dividing fiction from [reality]

Move in circles walk on the lines
No [human] being in sight
Calm the winds and calm the seas
Let's try another kind of [peace]
Who fights this holy civil war
A million men in uniform
Wo ist der [FÅhrer] der mich fÅhrt
Ich warte immernoch
And [god] is on your side
Dividing presence from the [history]
Watching all the time
Dividing deaf men from the [listening ones]
[ ]
Leave a light on in the night for me
That I can find you
And [god] is on your side
Dividing soldiers from the [fishermens]
Watching all the time
Dividing warships from the [ferryboats]

REAL
----

Now that I am back out there
Once more scared
Misgivings haven't gone
Inside this human race
No touch of grace
And still no place to go
I know it's up to me
To decide if this is real
But I'm walking to and fro
Always thinking about the ways I chose
Welcome back yesterday...
Not far away...
I'll keep an eye on you
Tell me how I could forget
All these angers I once had
Should I start again...
To find the same...
That I once left behind
Then tell me why should I forget
All these dreams that I still have
Another time...
Another turn, I thought
But now I know that's wrong
This life will still remain the same
If I don't change a thing myself
I know it's up to me...

Ok, that were all the  printed songs. I hadn't the motivation to hear and write
down the other ones...
