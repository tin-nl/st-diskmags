Hello and welcome to another issue of UNDERCOVER!

Well, we're writing the year of 1997 and nothing is just like it seems...

Immediately after the release of the  Xmas-issue .tnb. slipped into the biggest
crisis up to now. I don't know if  you've found the hidden  article in issue 7,
where Drizzt  had written  that .tnb. is  probably dead  when the issue will be
released...
Because of some internal differencies mOd leaved tnb in the first days of 1997.
Also Ex/Akt had stopped his musical  work and for some days Fallen Angel and me
were the  only active members  of .tnb. because  Drizzt had stopped his coding-
work. Because I think it  isn't time for  stopping .tnb. I have asked the other
members what they're thinking about this and some days after this horrible news
we (Lot, FXL, Fallen Angel and me) had  decided to keep .tnb. alive, only  just
for fun and for the Undercover magazine...
You surely know that it's hard for a group to release something without a coder
and so I asked Drizzt if he will really stop his work. He had said "yes" but he
wanted to stay in .tnb.
And so the  group is still alive, with nearly  all members, even if they mostly
have stopped her work on the Atari-computers. I know, its very sad, but we will
save .tnb. because its something  like cult for  us. We had funny times in this
band, chaotic and braindead days and we think this time should not be over over
night. And so .tnb. is back on track...
After very depressive  January-days the  state of .tnb. changed again... Drizzt
is active again but he will not promise anything so just  forget all our single
projects we had talked about in Issue 7 and the Xmas special.
It can be  that our  demo "Lasse Reinb”ng" will be released sometimes but don't
except it in the next time. The other  projects are really  stopped and I don't
think that we will release more demos in the future, even if it's sad.
Drizzt has also problems with his  hardware. His Falcon was  broken down in the
first days of February and so  he bought a MegaST4 for  coding, because  on his
old 1MB ST he wouldn't  code anymore. The problem was that all his sources were
saved on  the Falcon-HD  and he can't  reach them. So all other things are more
delayed.
But when you thought  that .tnb. was  a big group  again you're so wrong. After
the days of  reincarnation I  haven't heard  anything of the  other members  or
haven't seen any activities from them and so only Drizzt, Flash and  me are the
only  active members  this time (13.02.1997) and  I'm a  little bit angry about
this. But who cares...
But we hadn't only problems in .tnb. itself. Around  the Xmas-Days  our BBS had
a fatal Harddisk-crash and about 2 GB are lost, incl. the whole Atari-Area.
Because of this the JUNCTION was  offline for  some days. After the box was new
installed we  had problems to copy the old Atari-stuff again to Slapshots Amiga
because I wouldn't copy 70 MB stuff to disx. So we tried to connect my Syquest-
drive to the Amiga  but because of problems which the Amiga had with my MS-DOS-
formatted medium we aren't able  to copy the  stuff. And after several attempts
we have decided to copy  only stuff which  isn't older as 11/96  to the box and
so we had copied all the stuff with disx, because there were only 20 MB...
A cruel storie... 
But now the box is running fine and I will greet all the registered users...

You see  there were  many problems in  the weeks around New Year and I must say
that I sometimes was short  before it to kick  the computer in  the next corner
and stop all activities because it was very frustrating sometimes.
At this point I must also thank to the guys  which have written  some feedback,
because it was also their merit that we will continue our magazine. 

The first sign of real life in the "new" .tnb. is this new Issue of UNDERCOVER.
You can see  that there are  some changes in the mag itself. We have  optimized
the control  and killed  some bugs. All in  one I think that this  Issue is the
best undead one we have done up to now and I hope that the follwing issues will
be much better.
We will probably release also  a special-issue  for the SILICON-party at easter
but it depends on my coming because the other members of .tnb. which will be on
the party aren't very motivated in writing  articles and so one. But .tnb. will
be present at the SILICON, this is real save!
I will not talk about any planed party-releases, read above!

At last some words about the contents of this magazine.
I had  never thought that  we can match it to collect so many stuff in only two
months. Even  if the  scene is going down much more (just read the latest news)
there are  some cool releases around. So we have again a filled  and up-to-date
scene-corner with several  interviews. We have reviewed again demos, mags, cds,
games and  tools for all  Atari's (about 30 different reviews and previews), we
have  the usual  crap-corner, book  and music-reviews and last but not least, a
new corner... the Adult Corner... harf...
Some of you might say that this shouldn't included in a scene-oriented diskmag,
but be honest, the most of you will surely read the articles in this  corner =)

Another hot theme are the big Easter-parties. You all know that we have here in
Germany two big parties at  the same weekend. The  one is the SILIconvention'97
and the other the  Mekka'97/Symposium'97. Another party  at the same weekend is
the Gathering'97 but its more an Amiga-party. The problem is, that both parties
are for all systems and you know how little the Atari-scene is. It  can be that
this little scene will split up once more...
And it's obvious that  both parties in Germany will compete... I think the only
looser in this fight are the freax. Believe me, I would also drive to the other
party (Mekka/Symp) even if the party in the last year was a bad one.
Hum. Even if both parties are for all  systems it will  be safe that the scenes
on every system will not split up to much. So the SILIcon will be more an ATARI
and ACORN-party and the  Mekka/Symp an  Amiga and  PC-party. I don't think that
the big names of the Amiga-scene  will come to  the SILIcon (the only wellknown
bands are Haujobb and Artwork) and the same I think for the Mekka and the ATARI
scene. But we will see.
Eventually we will see much more  releases for the ATARI or we will see the end
of an already knocked out ATARI-scene...
Ok, you will think that I'm writing shit  but I think we  should throw the pink
glasses into the corner and then also you will  see that the ATARI-scene, which
was some years  ago a very big  one with  hundreds of crews all over Europe, is
only a shadow today. And this shadow shrinks from month to month...
The old  fighting spirit  is gone and  it is understandable when you're looking
around and see  that every month some freax or whole groups stop their activity
on the ATARI. I know, some years ago you had surely laughed about it, but today
the scene have not the substance to bear such big losses...
I'll better stop  here and we will  see what the parties will bring. We will be
there, on the SILIconvention ofcourse and we hope to see you!

Ok, that's all for now. We wish you some funny hours with our magazine...
