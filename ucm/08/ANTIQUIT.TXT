released by Strange Ways Records / Indigo 1995
genre : synthie-pop
price : 30 DeutschMark

This album contains some unreleased tracks by De/Vision from the years 1990-92.
Here you can feel the roots of this band, the melodies and also the composition
(especially the voice of the singer) sounding  very similar to the Depeche Mode
album which  was actual at  this time ("Violator") and because I think this was
the best DeMo-album  ever you  can think  that  I like  this earlier  tracks by
De/Vision also very much.
You will find the following tracks on the album:

1 - Lost In You
2 - Circulate
3 - If We Should Ignore This
4 - Melody Of Your Face
5 - Desertland
6 - What I Feel
7 - The Gold Of The Poor
8 - A Word In Season
9 - Into Another World

The  songs are all great with  one exception. The song "Desertland" sounds very
strange in  the beginning, many cruel  synthie-sounds and samples and  only the
second  halve of this  track is in the same  style as the other songs (they are
mostly marvellous  melancholic, the right  stuff for the  cold and dark winter-
days and nights in my eyes).
I don't know why  they haven't  released this  tracks  some years  ago, because
today they're sounding a little bit oldfashioned. This album hasn't the quality
of their debut-LP or the "Unversed In Love"-album but in spite of it it is also
a  nice (but a bit  short, only 38 minutes) thing and a must  for fans  of this
band and music-style.
The CD comes in a nice  digi-pack and  so there aren't any lyrics printed. So I
haven't included  them here because  I was not very motivated to hear the songs
and write them down... Just go to your next record-shop and make a "hearing"...
