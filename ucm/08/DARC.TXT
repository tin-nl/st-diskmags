As I have  read the textfile  I was scratching my head because the  autor means
that this game will be  the first Doom-clone for simple Atari ST. What? A Doom-
clone in only  280 KB?! Hum. So I copied  the files  to a disk and  started the
game on my good old ST. The first  things I've seen were some system-font-logos
zooming around  on the screen and a (shitty) starwars-scroller tells the storie
of the game.
Then the mission-briefing begun, but I don't know what's going on on the screen
this time.
Then a DARC-logo appears and a crude chip-music starts to play. The play-screen
opens. On the bottom of the screen was the control-panel with some informations
like ammo  and life-power. There was a face of our hero, the current weapon and
men. This little guy  turns around  when you're  turning yourself -> he has the
function of a compass. Right...
Ok, I started to move and... aaaargl... This isn't a Doom-clone! At first there
is only a  block-scroll-rout included. You can turn your hero only rightangled!
Hum, I was going through the dungeons and there were some little red creatures,
they're looking a bit like a devil and they're shooting on me. Ofcourse I tried
to defend myself and so I smashed the spacebar and the whole screen flashes...
Hu! That's my shoot! But I can't aim at the enemies. They must be in the middle
of the screen to be hitted... 
Aaarf.... Because  I'm very  fast died I  was happy  about this. So the pain of
this ugly game has reached the end and I smashed the ESC-key and I was happy to
see the desktop again.
I taked the readme-file again and laughed about the very primitive ideas of the
autor. I can only say: Forget it! This game isn't worth to be copied to a disk!
The grafix  are crap (crap colors, primitive animations...), the sound also and
even the  gameplay... Save your money! Even if the autor  has written something
about "support the  Atari-scene" ... "buy  this game"... If you  want to  buy a
3D-shot'em'up for the ST take "Destruction Imminent", the only real Wolfenstein
game for the ST up to now. D.A.R.C. hasn't even a real  3D-routine. Just forget
it... Think on my words...
                                                                                {*f1
