what?   : megademo - preview
disx    : 1

After long  times also  I have received  this demo. I had seen it in some mail-
boxes and swapping-lists and I have heard  that the demo should be  amazing and
so I was very anxious to see the demo by myself...
Now I have received the demo and smashed the disk  into my good old ST and with
my trembling fingers I switched the machine on...
Hum, at first there was nothing and then  again nothing... Erm... Defect? Again
copied and another try ... and  nothing... Should the reason why it doesn't run
be my ST again? I had in former times also some problems  to run several demos,
like "Colorz" which doesn't run only one time on my machine...
I have copied the disk again, the last time, and... it runs!
At first you can see a zooming Positivity-vector-logo and a ball behind it. The
logo surrounds the ball and turns around him in different directions...
Then a strange picture and the title of the demo appears...
I must mention  that you will hear  not a little bleep because the demo doesn't
contain any little piece of music.
Ok, the following screens I will mention separatly.

main-menu

It's a real  3D-labyrinth but without any  textures on the walls. You  must now
wander around and find the single screens which  are presented by little pix in
single  corners of  the labyrinth. There  are standing also  some skeletons and
some big heads around in the passages and corners and so it isn't to booring to
wander through the dungeon without seeing anything...
But I must mention that  this all is  extremely slow! It is  one of the slowest
3D-dungeon-routines  I've seen  up to  now on the  ST! Ok, it  fills the  whole
screen (320*200) but erm... rather a smaller screen and a bit faster because so
the motivation to visit all the screens will be saved a bit more...
The grafix  aren't bad  but also not  too brainblasting, simply  OK but I think
there should be  some more  things standing  around in the passages... It looks
simply better.

rotative zoomer

The first  screen I've  discovered. At  first a one-plane-grafic appears on the
right  side  of the  screen and  after this  2 different  textures turning  and
zooming around in a very  little screen-part (200*100  or smaller). But this is
all too fast, you will  see only  some wriggling grafix. The zoomed grafix were
nothing more as OK...
Hum, this  is nothing you must see... The main-menu must be reloaded after this
screen.

glenz-vectors

Ehem... I thought  this times are over?! Glenz-vectors are completely out-dated
today, at least this is my private view. Ok, they  are fast and not too little,
but you  always seen this  effect before, in demo which are many years older as
this one...
This screen is superfluous in my eyes.

space-trip

This screen  is again very  simple. You can  surely  remember to  the screen of
LEGACY in the "Froggies..."-demo where you  can see a Legacy-logo on the ground
which  scrolls in  the old chess-board-way... Here can see the same with a PST-
logo. Above  this there are some space-grafix  and to  simple vector-spaceships
flying around on the screen, nothing more...
The grafix were again only mediocre... nothing special.

mapped cube

The name  has said all about this screen. You will see a cube  with a skull-pic
on the sides turning around on the screen, but only around one axis...
That's all for this screen... boring...

....

I don't know if I have mentioned that it's very boring to walk around in a menu
to find  the single screens? I know  that two  more screens  are included but I
haven't found them up to now... It's shit if no alternative menu is included...
The other screens  were one with sphere-mapping and a 3D-sequence but I haven't
found them. I don't think that their quality is better as of the other screens.

Ok, all in one this  demo is only a  very early preview. I have  heard that the
final version will never be released. This is a bit sad, even if the demo isn't
state-of-the-art, because the ST needs every little release.
I for  myself had  not released  this preview because it's bad for the image to
release a demo without any music, no design and unready routines...
This demo  is only  interesting  for  demo-collectors. If  you want to see only
brainblasting  stuff you should take your hands  off from this demo because you
could be a bit angry after looking at it...
