Yup, here comes the sequel to the game "HEARTLAND" which I had reviewed for the
XMAS ISSUE of Undercover. Tony Greenwood  of STOSSER SOFTWARE  had send me this
game, thanks dude!
This game is  very similar to  the predecessor. You have to jump and run around
in a big  level and  must collect  ice-blocks. Your  hero is  again the egg you
surely know  from the Dizzy-games. But  this time you  must not only run stupid
through the level, no you must  get in contact  with divers figures in the game
like little snowmans, penguins and so one. You can and must get several objects
to finish the game. This objects you must  use at the right time... so you must
also think a little bit while the game.
Again  there aren't  enemies in  the game, only  some  spikes  again which  are
decreasing your energy. When your energy is going to zero you'll die, good eh?
The game  is finished if  you were died  or if you have collected all the game-
cards... In this game you  have not only to  collect game-cards as in the first
part, no you must collect diamonds, which were encased in blocks of Diamond Ice
and you must find a way to melt them down...
Ok, I'll  go over to  the technical side of the game. Hum. The grafix are again
very nice and a bit better  as in the first  game (they have now a bigger touch
of a commercial game...). For the ST they're great, detailed and good animated.
Your egg (the hero) runs over the  screen with fast and smooth 8-way-scrolling,
even on the ST. The game features also a little, but nice styled intro.
There aren't many  musix on  the ST, only a short chip-song in the intro and in
the game itself some ship-sound-effex. You play the game in full silence if you
don't  catch an  ice-block or if  you don't contact one of the creatures in the
game and this isn't good because so the running  through the biiig  level could
be a bit boring with the time.
On STE and Falcon you will hear a Xmas-sample the whole time and also this isnt
a good solution. I  would prefer module-sound with complex melodies, not only a
short snippet.
The control  is the same  as in HEARTLANDS. But  this is  because of the tricky
level-design. The control itself is good.
You have again the save-option and also the saveable highscore, and as you know
this saves the motivation.
Yo, more things? I think no. It's a good sequel  of a good game and if you like
jump'n'run  games with  puzzles  you should get it! Because it's  free you will
have much fun for nothing...
