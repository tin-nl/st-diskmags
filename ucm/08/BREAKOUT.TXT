                           (v.1.11 for Falcon (C) 1992)

This  text  originally  appeared  in ST+ Issue 3, and  reappears  here for  the
benefit  of those people who  may not have seen ST+ Issue 3..  As a joke review
of a joke  product, I quite enjoyed doing this little article..

PREQUEL..
I've managed to avoid a close assessment of the 'goodies' that Atari plonked in
the box with the original batch of Falcons..  When I excitedly fumbled the  box
open,  all of nearly four years ago(*),  I breezed through the sparse selection
of stuff that came with the machine,  and like a trauma patient with unresolved
psychological scars, have managed to skirt around the subject of what came with
the machine since then, avoiding even looking at the offending disk which is in
a dusty corner of my collection.. 

(*)Was it that long ago? Seems it was!!

Some stuff was super-duper useful,  such as 'Speedo-GDOS',  if I ever could  be
bothered  to get it installed,  Speedo-GDOS and a RAM hungry demo freak do  not
normally mix too well,  but this was at least thoughtful of Atari.. Other stuff
such  as 'Audio Fun Machine' was of the 'enjoyable for five minutes' ilk as  it
made  use of one of the new bits of the Falcon,  the realtime audio talents  of
the Digital Signal Processing chip (DSP)..  But this gets ahead of our story as
these bits only caught up with me about six months after the initial purchase..
To start with,  we had such grim and soggy offerings as 'ATARI BREAKOUT'.. (Tah
dah!)

Atari  Breakout  had everything wrong with it..  We start with the  front  end,
which  was purest GEM in a drab wet Monday morning sense of the word..  It  did
have  coloured blocks,  it did also claim to offer enhancements in the new  and
exciting higher colour video modes,  and indeed on 256 colour mode,  you  could
play  spot the gradually changing colour blocks,  about 112 in all,  each  with
their  own  individual colour!!  It still looked as dull as a very  dull  thing
taking depressants to lower the mood a bit more.. 

Truecolour  made  a  pigs ear of it though,  with  half  the  screen  seemingly
missing, and the problem of 'invisible' blocks that turned up later.. The 'bat'
was a thick red line at the bottom of the screen,  the 'ball' was an  anonymous
blob  that juddered across the screen,  and you sent the ball up the screen  to
destroy the bricks and clear the screen,  and that was it..  The kindest  thing
that one could say about the graphics,  was that they were 'functional' to  say
the least..

The gameplay itself was a poor advertisment for Atari,  as the mouse  movements
to control the bat,  and the ball movements across the screen, were treacherous
and  jerky,  as it seemed the Falcon was running out of processor time  on  the
uphill bits..  The bat was nowhere near eyeblink smooth, and seemed to stick in
the  corners  at  crucial moments when you were trying to get  to  a  difficult
ball.. The standard of coding has been some of the worst met outside of my very
early homegrown efforts on eight-bit computers ten years ago,  and Atari surely
should have been totally ashamed of themselves when they released it..

This  game  is also a conclusive nail in the coffin of operating  system  legal
games,  as  this game,  although distributed with the  Falcon,  also  described
itself  as  ST and STe compatible..  Surely,  it is not too difficult to  do  a
decent  game within the GEM environment,  but this sorry example says to  games
programmers worthy of the name,  go on,  cut corners, push the metal, stuff the
GEM,  innovate!!  And as such, it may have provided an unintentional service to
those Falcon owners with any programming ability wishing to take things further
on their chosen machine..

On  the  plus side (yes there is one!) it does feature heavy  use  of  samples,
namely  'thud'  as the ball hits the side of the walls,  and a  higher  pitched
glassy clicking sound when it hits a brick.. The endgame sample "Game Over man,
game  over!!" from the Alien II film provides a momentary flicker of  amusement
to the very easily amused..

There  is also a hidden feature,  or 'Easter Egg' as it is known in  the  trade
(no,  not  an easter egg,  more like a Cadbury's Creme egg,) as when  the  game
window  is  moved  partially off screen and you attempt to  start  up  a  game,
another sample kicks in..

It  starts  off with someone smacking their lips and giving a  huge  intake  of
breath  for what they say in an american accented voice,  which goes  something
like  "Mu-uve  thur  Window on scru-een!" which then tails off  in  a  brutally
clipped  self conscious giggle from the unfortunate and anonymous female  Atari
employee chosen to deliver this message..

The thought "This sample is utterly shite",  or the concept "This sample  needs
doing  again"  seems not to have occurred to anyone at Atari GHQ  in  Sunnyvale
California..

 Other good points include a fully configurable game,  including the option  to
set your difficulty level midgame,  change the game to 'break-thru' which is  a
whole lot quicker,  and the thrill of a job well done when you enter your  name
on  the  hiscore  table alongside the great and good of  Atari  Corp,  who  are
probably  no longer employed by them anymore!!  I would imagine that  the  game
would happily work inside a multi-tasking operating system such as MultiTOS, if
you like that sort of thing..

Anyway, one to steer clear of..


  Powerful..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's free!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm  going  to mess  about  with the .RSC file  to provide  a minute's worth of
childish amusement for myself when I've done this review..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Er, that's it..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  Powerless..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Worst case of GEM-Blandness ever..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Appalling screen handling and thus compromised gameplay..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sound samples featured in 'How not to do sound samples' handbook..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Shows Atari lack of care and attention at it's worst..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Makes Solitaire on 'Windows' seem worthwhile..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Or you could try..

Multi-Briques  for  the  Falcon,  a very lush and  French  designed  Truecolour
Breakout/Tonic  Tile game for the Falcon..  Up to four  players  simultaneously
too!!  A  demo has been going around for ages,  but 16/32 Systems may  well  be
doing the finished thing as a commercial release in the UK shortly..

Apologies to Bryn Jones for 'borrowing' his rating style..
