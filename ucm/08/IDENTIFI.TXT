This little utility  should help you  to identify  several files. For  this the
program searches for extensions and headers in the given files and can also see
if there is a text included in the files.
Up to now the program can recognizise the following files:

  file-type                       extension

- 8SVX samples                    (IFF,...)
- AIFF samples                    (IFF,AIF,etc..)
- ANBM animations                 (IFF,..)
- Atari executables               (PRG,TTP,APP,etc..)
- Atomik packed files
- AVR samples                     (AVR)
- BMP pictures                    (BMP)
- Calamus files                   (CVG,CDK,CFN) 
  - VectorGraphic
  - Document
  - VectorFont
- GIF pictures                    (GIF)
  - 87a
  - 89a
- ICE packed files
- ILBM pictures                   (IFF,LBM,BBM,..)
- JPEG pictures                   (JPG)
- LZH archives                    (LZH)
- Mastersound samples             (SAM)
- MS-DOS executable files         (EXE)
- Spectrum512 pictures            (SPU,SPC,SPX)
- STOS bank files                 (MBK)
- TIFF pictures                   (TIF)
- WAD files                       (WAD)
- WAV samples                     (RIF,WAV)
- WordPerfect documents
- XIMG pictures                   (IMG)
- ZIP archives                    (ZIP)

As you can see there aren't many types included up to now but this tool is only
two months  and so I  think there will be  much more file-types included in the
future.
This tool is very usefull if some files don't have an extension.
I would  like to see  module-formats and  more picture-formats included in this
utility, especially ST-picture-formats.
I will not write more  shit here and so  watch out for this program if you need
something like that....
