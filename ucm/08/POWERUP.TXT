Hum. Here we have a  game from the  ex-eastern-block. It's  the first ST/E-game
which I have seen from the east and it's a nice one!
POWER UP is a clone of the Super Cars game. You see the racing-track from above
and your and the other cars ar little sprites. I hope I must not say more about
this, you have surely played such a game up to now, at least I think so.
The technical  side is again much more interesting. This  game supports all the
different Atari-machines  with their special  hardware and so you have for each
system the best results. Another  thing I  haven't  seen for long  time is that
also sound-cards are supported! The game supports also the blitter if present.
The game  features 32colors  on the screen because of rasters. The presentation
is good  and all the  grafics are  nice for  a ST-game. The sprites  aren't too
little (as in RADICAL RACE on the Falcon) and also  the whole things around the
course are very detailed and painted with love.
Between  the courses  and in the  mainmenu you will hear tracker-sound, also on
the ST! In  the game  itself you will  hear  only some effects, I don't know if
they're sampled or not, but they're ok.
On the  Falcon the blitter is  much quicker  as on the ST  but for this you can
chose several screen-sizes.
You can play this  game also with a human opponent and than the game features a
splitted screen, as in the good old days of LOTUS etc.
The control is the best with keyboard, but also the joystick does his job.
Finally I could only  say that this game  is very well  done and I'm waiting for
the  final version. I had never thought  to see a game with  so many features to
support the single machines again.
If you like racing-games with the over-head-perspective you should get this one.
Also  Falcon-users should get it, because the  control is much better  as in the
game  RADICAL RACE and so it makes more fun. The final  game will contain also a
track-editor and  tracks in  different design, and  last but not least much more
grafix and musix.
So get in touch with the authors if you're interested in this game:
