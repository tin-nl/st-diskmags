                                    ----------------
                                    
genre   : joke-demo
system  : STE or Falcon with 1 MB RAM, TV / RGB or VGA-monitor
release : STE-version 07/94, Falcon-version 07/96

Hoi! Here we have the first  educational demo, done by some  swedish guys which
will introduce their language to all the demo-watchers around the globe. So you
will never need a dictionary. Just  watch this demo  and you  can talk with the
swedish people  about fishing  and many  other things. There are  more than  60
different fishes  mentioned and  so you can go in  a swedish fish-restaurant to
eat the fanciest dishes, you can go to a swedish fish-market to buy some of the
mentioned creatures, you  can interpret the fish-conserves in the swedish super
market at the next corner  and much more... You  see, this demo is very usefull
and also very interesting.
For your  enjoyment the demo features also great  pictures and so you can see a
very realistic picture for every  fish and so  you can see what you have fished
at you hollidays at a swedish lake. The  pictures use the  full capabilities of
the STE and also the Falcon (with some enhanced features).
Further the  demo brings you  a fantastic  swedish folk song and so you can get
used to the sound of this strange language.
What should I say?! I have  never seen  such a senseful  demo! It shows that we
really get a European Union and eventually we all become a new language because
no one works so hard on to introduce the own language as the swedes...
Ok, nice thing! I wouldn't give any ratings because coding and grafix are shit.
Only the strange sound makes this demo much more funny.

                                THE NI DEMO
                               -------------
                               
genre   : joke-demo                               
system  : Falcon only, RGB or VGA
release : 1995 (?)

This demo  shows that the FISK KOMPANIET also can code because it features fast
tridi-stuff, besides  the always known strange  sample-sound and so you can see
a house  flying around  in front of a starfield. The door opens and with a dull
sample a fish  come out. Then the  door closes and the house flips again around
on the screen.
Then the demo ends and you can  chose if  you want to  violate the memory or if
you want to switch to VGA-hires (cool on RGB-monitors).
This demo  is technical much better as the first one also very strange. I would
not give any ratings again because it's a  joke-demo and so you  shouldn't look
at the coding-style, design or whatever...
if you like joke-demos  you should  get both  demos. They're much better as the
lame shit  from IPIR and  they're beating  also the strange stuff of the SENIOR
DADS...
