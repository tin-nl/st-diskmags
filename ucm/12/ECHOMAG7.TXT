Hum, after the 6th issue, released in last summer there were rumours that the
mag  was stopped  and finally  we heard  that MINDWAR INC. (the former label)
disappeared from the screen.
Anyway  with the  new label  PRESTIGE  the mag  came back to life and the 7th
issue was released in early January.
So there was  some hope  to see  something  new. As I looked at  first to the
whole thing I noticed that it was 7 times  bigger than the last issue, and so
I hopped not only for more articles...
After loading the magazine some really colourful logos appeared on the screen
telling that PRESTIGE is  presenting ECHO MAG 7. Both were  painted by VULGAR
(Confusions^Mystic Bytes^Prestige) and looking not bad.
Than the menu was  coming up and it  looks very different to the old one. You
have six buttons and by clicking one button (btw, all is keyboard controlled)
a blue box with all articles for this part listed  appeared under the button.
Remembers a bit to  the ST shell of  Maggie. You can chose an article and the
viewer was  loaded. You have  two bars  without any function up and down from
the text, only displaying  the number  of pages. In the background there is a
picture displayed (some converted GIF-picture). The displayer doesn't feature
scrolling and you can change only page by  page (as in the old Echo # 6). Ok,
it does his job but I think scrolling  should be essential  in a diskmagazine
today, but it's my private opinion.
There is surely a music included, but I  think you  can only  listen to it on
the Falcon or at least on  the STE, on a humble  STf you have only boring and
not so comfortable  silence. At  least some  chip-music would  be great and I
think there are enough great tunes around, incl. sources.
The mag itself features 6 different  themes. You have  the regular stuff with
editorial, credits and so one, there are parts about the scene and interviews
and last but not least software and several  other things. Over all there are
about 40 articles included this time.
In the  interview-corner  you can  find  a load of  interviews, all  from the
polish scene, and also the scene-corner itself  features only stuff about the
polish Atari-scene, like  group-histories  of COBRA and GEDEON, scene-reports
and so one. And so I also reached the biggest handicap: the whole magazine is
written in polish and so it's some  kind of the pendant  to the french TOXIC-
Magazine which is mainly written for the french scene. Ok, I haven't anything
against supporting the scene in the own country and I can understand that its
very easy to write many  articles in the  mothertongue  but today, as all are
depending on another it's not so  friendly. Today as we  have only a few mags
left which supporting the Atari-scene in general it's not the best to exclude
all the foreign people from a  magazine. In former  times we had  enough mags
around  and it  wasn't a  big loss  if someone  was  making  a mag in his own
language, please think we had something like a mag-overkill (Maggie, ST News,
Ledgers, DNT Paper, Toxic, Amazine, Undercover, DBA  Magazine, Pure Bollocks,
Scriba Comunis Responsi, Massive Mag and a load others), but today only a few
magazines are left in general and so the most users want to read them all!
So please think about this opinion. We don't laugh  about bad  english, we're
only happy if we can read something different! Our english isn't the best too
but we're able to  inform the whole world  about the things going on. So give
it a try! The same also for the Toxic Mag makers! Because I got some articles
made  by ST Survivor  I know  that they're  able to  write  good  articles in
english too... and I'm sure the most people will understand english!
Ok, enough about this point. I can't give any  information about the contents
because I don't understand even a single line.
Hum, there are some goodies included (also polish productions) and all in one
it could be that they will come in the high society  of the diskmags, but for
this they must change the  language, no  question! Some little changes at the
menu itself (music, perhaps  scrolling) and  the mag  could go in competition
with the leading  magazines (Maggie and UCM). In  Poland they are surely No.1
but again, to  get some flower  pots in the  whole Atari-world the time isn't
right yet. So you ECHO-makers: get an  english dictionary  and inform  us all
about the things going on in Poland!
