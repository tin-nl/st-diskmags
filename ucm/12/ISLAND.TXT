ISLAND STRIKE is some kind of earlier work of TONY GREENWOODS - STOSSER TEAM.
He should be well known  for his latest  cool jump'n'run  games on ST, all of
them reached semi professional quality.
I found this game on a compact disk  by STAX and because  I never heard of it
up to now I thought: why not  make a review  of the game for  the UCM? And so
here it comes.
ISLAND STRIKE is some clone of games like "JUNGLE STRIKE" on PC and Amiga and
at least JUNGLE STRIKE on PC makes  a lot of fun. I  had played it many times
and so I was happy to get a similar game for my  ST and because  I know about
the skills  of TONY and his  team in making  ST-games I was  hopping for cool
game.
The plot of the game very simple. You have to fly around with your helicopter
and blow away enemies, or  at least their tanks, cannons, bridges and so one.
Besides this you can save some soldiers behind the enemy lines, get some fuel
and ammo, just the usual items. And you have a load of missions to finish.
The whole game plays on several islands (like  the name says) with  only very
small vegetation  and so you don't have problems to check out all the enemies
and items.
Before starting the  game you can chose one of four different co-pilots. They
have different  skills - and  if you  chose a medic  you will  get some extra
armour. And so you  can chose between  medic (extra armour), navigator (map),
engineer (fuel) and gunner (extra ammo).
Ok, I started a first  round of playing  and after I left  the main menu with
several  options (like save/load  game, view  highscores and so  one) I found
myself on the playfield. Hum, I will  not write  any word about the  technix,
this will follow a  bit later. I tried to fly  around and I must say that the
control with the joystick  isn't the best. Meanwhile the PC-game is some kind
of isometric you  have here just a  2D-perspective. Anyway I  think a control
via keyboard  would be a lot  better. Anyway, if you  train a while  you will
check out the control a bit better and can start to fight against the enemies
and this isn't as easy as in the  big PC original. Because of  the bit tricky
control you need several  tries to destroy the tanks and  cannons and because
they seem to damage you with every shot you'll be gone within some minutes.
It's nearly impossible  to destroy the  enemies without being damaged. To get
the soldiers and the items you must  fly above them  and pull the stick back,
now you can  see a little  animation with the  item you got. All the specials
will fill up the ammo etc, with about 25%.
Anyway  the game is  a bit hard. I was  destroyed everytime  only after a few
minutes and I miss the special weapons from the PC (missiles and so one) very
much. On the  PC you could  destroy many  stuff and  it wasn't  impossible to
destroy the enemy without being damaged.
But this isn't the only  point of critcism. Even  if the game is freeware the
grafix are a bit cruel. All the  stuff on the  playfield was only  very small
and you have to take your glasses to check out the single items. But also the
style of the grafix and  animations isn't the  best. It remembers me a bit to
old public domain  games from the  late 80ies  and especially  because I know
about the skills of the team behind STOSSER SOFT I'm a bit disappointed.
I don't want to write much  about the sound. In  the intro and  menu you have
some nice chipmusic but in the game itself only some chip noises. Hurr...
More? Better no. The motivation lacks a  bit of the hard and unfair gameplay,
the only thing which saves the motivation is the possibility to save the game
and to save the  highscores. So you  can start from  the last point and don't
must fight your way through all the levels again.
Conclusion: hum... I was all  other as  impressed. After  about ten  tries to
            play the game I finally  gave up and  I think I  will dig out the
            original game on PC if I want to fly some rounds with a heli. The
            game is only for some freaks who don't are too much interested in
            the style of a game, with a  light kick of  masochism... The only
            positive point is that it's freeware  and you can  check out it's
            limits without paying any fee...
