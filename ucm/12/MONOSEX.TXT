                          DE/VISION - "MONOSEX"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by WEA 1998

2 years  after "Fairyland?" the german Synthpop-heroes striked back, with the
first release under  the Major label WEA. And as you  know, not all bands can
hold their style and quality after leaving the Independent scene.
Ok, a Major label  has surely more money  and so the new releases can be much
more pushed, enter the  charts and also the music TV. Hum, I saw the Video to
their track "We Fly...Tonight" sometimes on VIVA and VIVA 2 (german Music TV)
but they didn't matched  it to reach the final breakthrough in the german top
1oo charts. The album  was a very few  weeks on the latest places and then it
disappeared again, meanwhile  the band  was still  on tour... Also  the first
single "We Fly...Tonight" doesn't matched it to enter at least the Top 2o...
This isn't the best sign, because  DE/VISION were  some kind  of spearhead of
the german synthpop-scene and  even under  their old  label STRANGE WAYS they
matched it to enter the charts... So what happened?!
More later... as first as always the contents of the album...

Hum... twelfe songs in nearly 5o minutes, so it's the same as the older stuff
(seems to be some kind of standard in the german synth/electro pop scene).
After a first listen to the whole album I thought: "Hu, sounds sometimes like
the new album from Depeche Mode!"... Ok... it was just a first impression.
But after a second and third try I thought: "Shit! What happened to them?!".
Yep, even the last album doesn't reached the both first fulltime releases but
it had some nice songs, no  question. But this  time the whole sound was more
and more changed, not  typical De/Vision anymore. Someone might say that it's
some kind of important to go on, not to stand still on the same place, but it
was some kind of a feature, the melancholic  voice of the  singer and all the
kewl synth-stuff. Now you can hear  sometimes real euro-dance-beats, bleurgh!
The guitar-stuff (also some kind of  the new features) are nice but always it
seems as they have listened to much to "Ultra" by DeMo, even if they say that
"Monosex" was already finished before DeMo... Here the same as for the compi-
scene... not who coded or composed at first something is the man, the one who
released the new stuff is the man!
Ok, some words to the single songs...

o1. What?! Hard beats, stretched voices?! What happened?! Anyway not bad...
o2. Horr... I don't  understand why they have chosen this song for release on
    a maxi-single! It's just boring, features nothing special  and so it's no
    question that it doesn't hitted the lines of the charts!
o3. A slower song, not  bad but without  bigger highs, but  even without very
    deep points...
o4. De/Vision goes Depeche Mode/Ultra! Sounds like clone of "Barrel Of A Gun"
    only a bit softer... softer? Yep, the  singing... therefore  you have the
    similar beats, stretched voices and nice synth-stuff too. A good song and
    the next single-release too.
o5. Also a nice song, slow, soft and something to lay back and dream...
o6. Huar! Sounds  like shit-euro-dance-pop! Bleurgh! What  the  hell?! Ok, it
    might be that the lyrics aren't very happy but it sounds  like a just for
    fun song...
o7. This is just an instrumental, remembering  to the  new releases  of DeMo,
    esp. "Barell Of A Gun"...
o8. What's this?! It's slower than the 6th track but also some kind of boring
    and uninteresting, with fucking ugly basslines...
o9. This remembers a bit to the old times, even if there are again those ugly
    Euro-dance-lines  are  included... Hum, don't  know... some  passages are
    really nice.
1o. Yep! Finally a new typical  De/Vision-song! Slow, very  emotional, and so
    horrible melancholic, sniff... just  nice... this  time  they  also  have
    included some sad violins  and piano! Without  any doubt one  of the best
    songs on this album!
11. A bit  faster again, but  this time  with nice  stretched  voices  in the
    refrain and for sure a  song for the dancefloors. One of the better ones,
    because the kind of singing has the touch of the old stuff...
12. Without any doubt the best song on this album! Pure De/Vision sound, just
    in the style of "I Regret"... just great!

Erm... What the  hell happened  to them?! I really don't know what's up. It's
no question for me  that the change of  the label is also responsible for the
change of the sound. Ok, I've lost the connection to all  the synth-pop-stuff
but anyway I like De/Vision  because of the heavy  melancholic sound and so I
was very disturbed that they left their old  way... I only hope that the next
album will be a bit better, that they  will notice that  they will loose many
old fans if they will not change their mind and come back to the roots!
