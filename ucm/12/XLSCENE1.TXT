            HISTORY OF THE POLISH 8-BIT ATARI SCENE - PART ONE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can  read about the history of the polish 8-bit Atari scene. nothing
more to say... just read it and we wish you nice reading :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The beginnings of the  Atari XE/XL scene in Poland we can date on turn of the
years 1988/89. At  that time some  computer  clubs and unions started to make
productions  what they called - demos. But this weren't real demos. There was
only one picture, under it a scroller and the musics were ripped from games.
Later appeared  computer exchanges, where you could get software from Germany
and Holland but it were only the pirate copies, 'cause at this time in Poland
we hadn't any copyrights law protection. Pirates started to get in touch with
others. So, in this way came into being informal net of the exchange pirates.
Then they  created informal crews. 1st they cracked games but quickly started
make demos. There  were effects  like: 16 sprites, 128 colours on the screen,
scrolls and  stars. And of  course ripped  msx. The best demos from years ago
were 'Equation of Time' by OUR SOFT, 'Duksap' by USSR and 'Revenge of Magnus'
by WFMH.
In 1990 took place  something like a turning-point. Magnus, main coder of the
WFMH crew, made  the first  professional  tracker called  Future Composer. It
caused that in demos the first orginal musics came up.
TL, musician  and coder from  USSR crew, made his own msx software too, where
you could compose music with samples.
And consequently the demos changed. In 'The Top 1' demo by WFMH crew we could
see the first vector objects, like: cubes, pyramids, floppies, x-wings and...
forks :) ! At the same time the crew OUR SOFT made 'Stop' demo where the same
effects were included but with perspective.
In 1991 we had a real boom on the  commercial market. The most  famous polish
games  were  released  this  time, like:  'Lasermania', 'Mission', 'Operation
Blood', 'Fred' and much more.
The following  crews made  many commercial  productions this  time: USSR, OUR
SOFT, ASF, MIRAGE and  SCS, but they  made many cool  demos too, for example:
'The Top 3', 'Garfield Demo' by  MIRAGE  and 'Laser Demo' - a curiosity, this
demo was made by AVALON, a commercial software firm.
But the real  explosion we had in 1992/93. In 1991 on the market appeared one
maybe two new  productions per  month but in 1992 we had about 5 new products
weekly!!! Former  pirates started  up own  firms: MIRAGE, ASF, AVALON, SONIX,
SPECTRA, DOMAIN SOFT, KRYSTAL, etc. And of course demos gained new quality.
OUR SOFT crew  made 'Intel Outside' demo  where  you  could  see things  like
filled, lightsourced  and glenz  solids. Besides commercial  products (mainly
games) appeared  a new trend - making  MOD players. At  first they were using
standard  memory  only - 64kB and could replay MODs with real low frequency -
5kHz, 4bits/channel. After  some time we had better players, which used extra
memory (4 example 512 kB) and could play with 11kHz frequency!!!
But in 1993/94 we  had another  breakthrough and  it brought some changes but
changes for the worse :(  Came into force the law about copyrights protection
but piracy was still in good condition. Many firms crashed.
But the  scene was alive. In  the end  of 1993  ZELAX crew made their 'Ray Of
Hope' demo where you can see effects like in Amiga demos: shadebobs, plasmas,
trackscrolls, raytracings, etc. But nobody knew how big the scene was.
Just in June 1994 was the first  polish XE/XL copy party in Mirowo. Legendary
crew - SHADOWS - was the organizer. On this party were only 30 people but the
scene was  much bigger. Main  attraction  on this  party was  the demo-compo,
where were  showed two  shocking demos: 'Bitter Reality' by  SLIGHT crew  and
'Sweet Illusions' by SHADOWS.
