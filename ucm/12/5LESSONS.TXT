...there were a lot of fake-demos in the past, but we missed a long time some
real ideas. Till  we got this one. We  had a pretty good laugh when we looked
at it at InterJam party ever and ever again.

5 EASY LESSONS IN SWEDISH  is 251 kB in  size and  comes as one TOS-file. The
reviewers are not too sure about the question of who coded this demo. Rumours
in IRC told us that it was mainly done by TAM/TOYS and Evil/DHS.

After starting it, you  can firstly select your favourite screen mode, VGA or
RGB. (a sign of Evil's code?) Then the screen is set to black and some truely
ugly graphics  are displayed, showing a  clock on the upper right side of the
screen that  switches from 12:00 to 13:00 all  the time. On the bottom of the
screen, some  Swedish stuff  I do not understand is written. Surely I have to
take  a deeper  look into this demo  to  learn  what  it means... After that,
another  screen  with the  name of  the demo (really fine  drawn! ;) and  the
teacher saying "Teach yourself Swedish in five easy lessons".

Lektion 1: one humanoid  body in  two colors. It  surely  is a woman with red
           hair or so. The  teacher says: "You are a _very_ beautiful woman".
           But the editor of this article thinks it means something like "I'd
           like to fuck you" (the word "popopanna" or  whatever  sounds  like
           this...). Hehe.

Lektion 2: two green bottles of beer  and the teacher  saying: "What kinds of
           beers  do you  serve at  this  establishment?" (the one the editor
           likes most!) Surely means: "C'mon, dumbass, gimme'beer!"

Lektion 3: a negro  with  fat lips  and blue  hair. (hey, you  guys have real
           talent! I  like this  picture!). The  teacher  saying: "Excuse me,
           Sir, are  you  a  foreigner?" LOL! I  won't  say what  I think the
           Swedish translation means... ;)

Lektion 4: a guy standing  next to his orange  house and the  teacher saying:
           "Hi! Do you come here often?"

Lektion 5: another bottle of  beer. Teacher: "Hey mate, let's go for a beer".
           I really don't know what the Swedish translation could be.


In the end there are tree  guys shown, jumping up and down whilst our teacher
says good bye...

5 EASY LESSONS IN SWEDISH  is a good fake demo with a brilliant idea. Well, I
am sure it doesn't make much sense for a guy from Sweden, but it is even more
funny for  the people in  other contries. Not at least because of that moose-
language  called Swedish. ;) Maybe  there will be another party or maybe even
some  demos of  this kind in  German, Polish, Dutch  or  French? I am looking
forward to this.

...so after this review, here is the rating, better  called "fun factor" this
time.
