The Volcanic Party gets more and more famous each year. At the first Volcanic
Party (in 1995), there  were only  80 persons, then 200 during the Volcanic 2
and about  250 for the Volcanic 3. This year, more than 450 computer addicted
persons were present in a big room (1700qm) in Cournon, near the geographical
center of the France. The party started on friday, february 27th and ended on
monday, March 2nd in the morning.

This time, the  organizers wanted  to attract  the maximum of participants: a
big room, a huge free car park, 500  tables, 1000 chairs, 200 KW of  electric
power, Internet access, 384 RJ45 ports in the whole room, a giant screen (6 x
4.5 meters) and two very impressive Barco 3D video-projectors with THX sound!
3D glasses were distributed  at the entrance in order to see a short 3D movie
called "Mad Racers". This  professional movie dealt with a futurist car race,
and the  3D allowed nice relief  effects. It was really great !! On the other
hand, I was  disappointed because, unlike  during the other Volcanic parties,
the organizers didn't show us an intro made with synthesis pictures...

The party  organization seemed to be OK: bar opened  all the days and all the
nights, low prices and varied food (but... where were the pizzas???). A login
and a  password were  distributed  to every participant  in order to vote for
each competition. Like the last  Volcanic parties, the giant screen  was also
used  to  show  numerous movies: The Fifth Element, The Professional, Twister
and so on. The organizers  had also the  great idea to present us the Silicon
Graphics' abilities on the giant screen and its great software called "Maya".
"Maya" looks like "NeoN 3D" or "Chloe" on Atari, but more powerful because it
can calculate realtime morphings and animations: wow!!

Most of  the participants  brought their  PC, but  the atarists and amigaists
were numerous  enough to show  there is still  an alternative. We'll note the
marginal  presence  of some  Risc PC, Oric Atmos, C-64... For  the video game
computers, there  were some  Playstations, 1 Neo Geo CD, 1 Super Nintendo and
an authentic Vectrex console with its build-in monitor !

What  about  the  Atari  section? Surprisingly, there  were more ST's in this
party  than in  the  Volcanic Party 1  in 1995! The  Falcons  were  the  most
numerous, and we  could see an Hades 40 and a TT. So, in the whole room, I've
seen 7 ST's (6 STE  and 1  Mega STE) and  about  14  Falcons. Some crews were
present: Sector One (all  the  members  came!), Popsy  Team, LouD!, Idemline,
Typhoon, Supremacy, Trisomic Development and Atrocity.

Does "lots  of  atarists" means "lots  of  productions"? Well... nice  things
were presented but  don't wait for "Sonolumineszenz" or "Lost Blubb" quality!
Two intros and  one demo were presented but only 1 intro was diffused. Why? I
don't know! The  organizers didn't  succeed in plugging an ST on their video-
projectors (what a shame!) so they just filmed the intro!!! The only ST intro
presented, though, runs on ST and Falcon. It was coded by Ptif, a young coder
from Typhoon and Supremacy crews. As  the intro competition was opened to all
the computers, this ST intro was presented with 2 PC and 1 Amiga intros.
Guess what? The ST  intro won!! You  know, a good intro isn't necessarily the
most technical  one, it's  often the  most  original  one! This intro, called
"Marto", laughs  at IBM France's  shitty TV  advertisements, so if you're not
French, you can't  understand the first part of the intro ("It doesn't print?
It's Henry, he  has bring  back to us  some virus from Internet!"). The other
intro, called "Volcano IV", which  also runs  on ST and  Falcon, was coded in
GFA by Sine/Idemline. You  can  find  nice  effects (don't  forget it's GFA):
wired 3D, sinus  waves, draughtboard... So bad  the organizers didn't show us
this intro for the competition!  8-(

The productions were quite rare, but the projects are far more numerous:
- STGhost/Sector One (author of the DBE Tracker and of AVI players for Falcon
  and Hades) presented  a soundtrack  player in  accessory. He  would like to
  code an MP3 player (audio MP3's) for Falcon... wow!
- Exyl/Sector One, author  of "Mr Boomer" (shareware game), was  finishing at
  the party his intro for the Toxic Mag #15 (ST and Falcon).
- David Carrere was working on a new FlaySID version (C-64 music player).
- BouB/Popsy Team is  still  working  on  his "Command and Conquer" clone for
  Falcon and Hades.
- The Typhoon crew started at the party their next "ST Collection" compil and
  was preparing the next Toxic Mag (btw. it will be ready for May or June).
  Ptif and Telsud  were debugging  their  game  called "The Trace", a sort of
  "Tron" game with several players simultaneously (8 players, I think).
  Razaac and Senser  have finished their "Atari ST Anthology" CD-Rom, full of
  demos and intros for ST/STE.
- ST Survivor/LouD! (formerly in No Limit Coding) couldn't present their GFA-
  megademo "Back in France" because of a bug: the demo doesn't work with less
  than 2 MBytes of memory!!

What about the ambience? Not as good as Volcanic III, as said Zerkman (author
of Videl Inside), but it's far more  better than Saturn Party 97!! As for me,
I didn't like  the bag full of  advertisements which was distributed to every
participant  at the entrance, it  sounds like "commercial party"... And where
was the mythical realtime article???

To conclude, the  Volcanic Party VI was a good party, but I hope its "spirit"
won't die through  the years... Of course, I  will be  there for the Volcanic
Party 5 in 1999, with all the ST freaks. And what about you???
