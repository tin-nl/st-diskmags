=============================================================================

This is (more or less) an article that is aiming at clearify all the problems
and troubles, we  have had in  the last months, with our beloved IRC-channel,
simply called #atari.

So if you have been confused by the happenings on IRC in the past months, you
should read this text.

For getting  facts instead  of rumours  and for giving the facts on a serious
background, I (Q) will  involve Evil (EVIL) of DHS in this article. I decided
to ask Evil, just because he is a kind of #atari-dad, I believe.

Since my first  visit on IRC, there  were almost always those 3 letters "evl"
somewhere in the /who #atari list.
BTW, at my first  visit there (I suppose in 1996), I asked him if he was "The
Evil" (I meant the famous Evil from DHS). He answered "Evil enough for 10".
Ha! I will  never forget that. I  couldn't really believe to talk to the guy,
I read about in several demos.

However, let's skip this little trip in the past, and come to the topic.

My last  visits on  IRC (#atari, of course) were  a bit confusing  to me. The
always official #atari was set "invite only". That means, you cannot get in.

Q:
Evil, why aren't we allowed to get in and who is reponsible for that?

EVIL:
Called a  takeover. Some evil (hehe) person  has taken to his life-assignment
to fuck  up #atari. It's very  tricky to figure  out who is in charge for the
takeovers, as he "spoofs" his identity.

Q:
Afterwards  you  and  some  others  have  opened  their  own  channel, called
#atariscne. Why did you do that and what is this channel about?

EVIL:
Because  we were  sick of  the recent  happenings at #atari (takeovers, porno
ads, "fuck atari" floods  etc..) and  lately there has come a few regulars to
#atari  we  really  didn't  like. So, opening  a  new  channel  that  we  can
administrate  as we  wish and  inviting  the people we want there felt like a
good idea. And it turned out that it was as well..
It's mainly  for those  who does  demos, games, or general atari development.
Eg, not for those  who mainly are there to speak how great his voodoo2 is for
his pc. Those will be kicked ;)

Q:
In the  last days, #atari was  visitable again, but  there were a lot of guys
that are  unknown to  me. Further they  did not speak and the only thing they
seemed  to do  is joining  and leaving #atari. Do  you know what is happening
there?

EVIL:
Takeover, as I spoke about above..

Q:
Finally, do you have any advices for irritated users?

EVIL:
Yep, if  you like atari, and  development of atari software (any type..) join
#atariscne  instead! :-) Otherwise..  well, use  #atari  as  well  as  it  is
possible or create a new chan like we did..

Q:
If you want to add anything, that doesn't fit to the questions do it:

EVIL:
Uhm.. not  really, except  that you can  see a whole lot of ugly irc faces at
our homepage ;)  http://wombat.ludvika.se/dhs/

Q:
Thank you for the deep scientific talk :)
