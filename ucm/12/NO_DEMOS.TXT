
                         As a sleeper  in metropolis
                           You are  insignificance
                    Dreams become entangled in the system

                     Enviroment moves  over the sleeper:
                               conditioned air
                        conditions sedated  breathing
              The sensation of viscose  sheets on naked flesh -
                                soft and warm
                but lonesome in the  blackened ocean of night

            confined in the helpless safety of desires and dreams
                         we fight our insignificance
                             the harder we fight
                             the higher the wall

                          Outside the  city spreads
                               like an illness
                                It's symptoms
               In cars that cruise to  inevitable destinations
                       tailed by the silent spotlights
                         of society created paranoia

                          No alternative could grow
                         where love cannot take root
                           No shadows will replace
                         the warmth of  your contact

                         Love is dead  in metropolis
                   all contact through  glove or partition
                                what  a waste
                                 the  city -
                              a wasting disease

                                                         ROUGH TRADE (C) 1983

                    Demos that never saw the light of day
                    -------------------------------------

                                 -PART ONE!-


Lotsa  announcements about  upcoming demos  were made  during the last years.
Many of  those groups  never kept  their promises  and so  lotsa long awaited
demos  were lost  on some harddrive. This  article was  written to remind you
what we all have missed because of various reasons like lazyness.


o DELTA FORCE - SHOCK THERAPY (ST)

Announced in  Maggie 10 in 1992, but  they decided  to give  a shit about the
scene  and left silently  in 1993. Delta Force  got a nice  music taste but a
sucker attitude!


o DUNE - ILLUSION (3 DISKS) (ST)

We all were  waiting for it for so long. According to ST Survivor, Evil Metal
of Dune has a working preview version but he won't spread it.
He told  ST Survivor  to mind  his own  business. Hey  Evil Metal: "You are a
sucker if you  already know that  there will never be a final version and you
still won't spread the preview."


o EQUINOX - VIRTUAL ESCAPE (ST)

I saw a first  preview at the Fried Bits 3 party in 1995. Latest rumours told
that Keops want to finish the demo using PacisfiST!


o AGGRESSION - MOTION BLUR (FALCON)

This is a  pure mystery to me. We've been told that Xenit has sold his Falcon
and so it's not clear if anyone else will finish this demo.


o T.S.C.C. - MOSTLY HARMLESS (ST)

This demo  is released... naaah  but not in the way we wanted to do it first.
In 1994 MJJ prod made a Falcon demo with the same title and that took all our
motivation  to finish  it. We have  released  all the  screen seperately, for
example the FLIGHT OVER SIRIUS dentro.


o ALIEN CRACKING FORMATION - JACKTRO (ST)

Jacky has only  to do some finishing touches and need some gfx, but he is too
lazy... :-)


o OXYGENE - FLIPO 2 (ST)

I don't  know if this  really was planned but I have already seen FLIPO 2 and
FLIPO 3 logos. Anyway Leonard is doing a new demo and that's what count.


o THE LOST BOYS - OH CRICKEY EXTENSION DISKS (ST)

They never really promised an extension but they also never denied it.


o ANIMAL MINE - GREAT STUFF COMPILATION 66
              - FUTURE COMPOSER EDITOR

In 1996/7  it was definitely  clear that  their will  never be a  GSC 66 or a
Future Composer Editor  on ST. Those guys are  so lazy. The last thing that I
have heard was that Stratagem wants to release a 'Making of GSC 66' including
all sources etc. on several  disks, but up to now we have seen nothing of the
above mentioned.


I hope you  have enjoyed  our little timewarp. I  hope to continue  with this
article series  next time. If you remember any demos that were also lost then
do not hesitate to contact me: mc_laser@usa.net

Alright that's all.
