                 VOICES AND FEEDBACK TO UNDERCOVER # 11
               ------------------------------------------

We got many different notes, good and of course some bad  ones too. Anyway we
know about  the big error  with the font  in the last issue and as you see we
chanhed it. But it was mOd's  idea to  include a "stylish" font, do  you know
about his "design-paranoia"?! Ok, here are a few messages, letters and voices
to the last issue...

Hi there!

I just browsed through (=read everything but the articles in german, those
take a bit longer for me to read). It's sad that the shell isn't working
100%. If I have understood things correctly you let the intro set the
resolution and then you return to that one that the intro left with?
Anyways it works enough to be able to read the articles, no bugs found
there. I have two suggestions to make though :-)
1. When using alt-arrows to move the mouse with the keyboard I would like
   to see something like shift-alt-arrows for slow moving.
2. Pressing spacebar takes you back where you last where in the main text

The hanging of the system after a save seems to have something to do with
stealing and restoring system vectors? (as the music seems to be the thing
that crashes)

But it works with accelerated falcons, and for that I'm happy :-)
The content is also very good, much scene news :-)
(...)
Thanks for a good mag, keep the good work up!


TAM / T.O.Y.S.

...editors note... Hi TAM! Thanx for your  critics! As you  can see  a lot of
                   things were  changed again, perhaps  you like it much more
                   now, eh?! Anyway EARX did  a horrible  job with  debugging
                   the shell again and again. With every new feature about 10
                   new bugs were  included but we hope that the mag runs more
                   stable now. Just send us your meaning about  the twelve so
                   that we can see that we're on the right way, or not?
                   Btw, which accelerator you're using?
                   Be sure, we will go on: NO RETREAT AND NO SURRENDER!
                   .moondog.

Hi Eric!

I've just received the new issue of UCM and as usual it's very
captivating, the necessary link between the survivors. I know how long
it takes to release such a zine but don't give it up!

                   like hell... hope the same from you! Hehe! .moondog.

Yo man!

VERY short letter this time!!  :)
I've received the UCM 11 some days ago and I've very
happy to read it ! The articles are very numerous and
interesting !

BUT, what's this shitty font you have used in the mag
???
It seems to be ST Low resolution ! Moreover the font
doesn't
display ALL the characters ! Please tell to the shell
coder
that he should run his shell in ST LOW instead !

...editors note... Hi Stephane! Eh, about the font, just  kick mOd's ass! But
                   now it's changed (thanx  to Evil!). And  you're right! The
                   whole mag  runs in LowRes! But now you should have checked
                   out why, it depends on the new features which were already
                   planned at the 11 but not included... .moondog.

Hi Moondog,

I've been reading UCM11...liked the intro & with a lot of work the
shell should be great...reminds me a little of some Amiga mags I saw
when I used to have one of those uninteresting machines...
(...)
Looking forward to UCM 12 (with a fully working shell!)...

Kevin / sh3 - Reservoir Gods

...editors note... Hi! Hope  the  shell runs  now  a bit  better, even  on UK
                   machines, eh?! And you're right, we're Amiga oriented with
                   the style, looks better than the usual Atari diskmag style
                   don't  you think?! Esp. because  you always  have to fight
                   on Atari against  the shoutings that you're ripping of the
                   other magazines... now it's over, because  we're the first
                   ones who created a mag in this style on ST... .moondog.

Hi Moondog!

(...)
Yeah, great issue! Good interviews and its brilliant to see
the demos section so packed with cool new stuff!
(...)
Enjoyed the checkpoint intro - nice sense of humouor in the scroller!
How come sierpinski triangles have come into fashion all of a sudden?
Is it all my fault??!!
(...)
They aren't major bugs really, as long as the magazine runs stably
when you are reading articles - which it does now. Congrats!
(...)
Hope you enjoyed Maggie 25 (and didn't find too many bugs!)

See you,


 Mr Pink / RG

...editors note... Hi Mr. Pink! Hehe... it seems  as we're on the best way to
                   beat you, don't you  think?! Anyway  the current  shell is
                   again  debugged  and  contains more  features. Therefore I
                   found some shit in Maggie 25... you know what  I mean?! No
                   music and shit colours in the ST version... what happened?
                   Do you  really think you  can beat  the UCM whit  included
                   bugs, eh?! Just  kidding... Yeah, the  Checkpoint intro is
                   cool, no  question. But wait  for their  coming demo... it
                   will beat nearly everything on ST so far!
                   Ok, have a nice  read and check Maggie ST next time before
                   releasing it. Don't want to read it in monochrome again...
                   .moondog.

Die "11" ist wieder  mal cool, ebenso  die Goodies. Wenn die Szene noch lebt,
dann in diesem Mag.
(...)

...editors note... Thanx! Das geht runter wie ôl! Vor allem bin ich froh, daû
                   das  Durcheinander mit den Sounds  in der  11 Dir nicht so
                   auf den Magen geschlagen war  und somit hoffe  ich auf ein
                   paar weitere coole Sounds fÅr die kommenden Ausgaben! Btw,
                   wie wÑr's mal mit einem CREAM-intro fÅr's UCM?!  .moondog.

Moondog  send me  UCM #11. The  intro  was  good but a bit "old-fashionned" I
think. Errr... I've  told Moondog that I didn't  like the UCM #11's interface
very much: WHY is it in ST Low? The font is so ugly! And I hope the bugs will
disappear the next time...  8-)
(...)

...editors note... Hi again! Yep... the font  was changed  but the shell runs
                   still completely in STlow. I think you already checked out
                   why? Just try to display  pictures in  medres... looks  so
                   horrible ugly... but also the problems with the res-switch
                   in the former shell were kicked  out with it... so the mag
                   runs more stable  on Falcon too. And the bug-hunt goes on,
                   no question! .moondog.

Offiziell note from Dream:

We was  a little  bit iritated  about the  last Undercover, someone  used our
name! Dream  wants to say, that the Members of Dream are: Aldi of Dream, Lidl
of Dream  and The niveauless  Tengelmann of Dream, so nobody  else should use
our synonymes. If someone wants to join us, he could use the synonym Edeka of
Dream.
End of the offiziell Note from Dream.

...editors note... The article was written just for fun... perhaps you should
                   release  something to  show us  that your band  isn't just
                   fake or a bunch of lamers too, don't you think?! .moondog.

Hallo Eric!

(...)
Danke fÅr UCM #11. Ich hatte nicht  viel Zeit zum lesen, aber was ich gelesen
habe, hat mir gefallen. Mein Favorit: die  wahre  Falcon Szene II... (das sag
ich als Mike of Stax...)
Running Test war auch ok - Dein Kaufaufruf sprach mir aus dem Herzen.
(...)
Machs gut!

Michael / Mike of Stax

...editors note... Hi Mike! Schîn das Dir die Falcon  Szene gefÑllt, da  sind
                   nicht alle Leute so scharf drauf... weiû auch nicht so ge-
                   nau  warum, scheinbar kommt  der eine oder andere nicht so
                   damit zurecht fÅr eine  Parodie herhalten zu  mÅssen. Weiû
                   nicht, ob das fÅr oder gegen ihn spricht...
                   Running... wie gesagt, sobald  ich wieder  einen laufenden
                   Falcon habe, kommt auch von mir eine Bestellung.
