Ok, today  I got 2 new packs  by the last  german compact  disx makers, STAX.
It's long time ago that I saw the last STAX packs and so I was very surprised
to get new menues from them. Both were released on the 7th of March, ofcourse
by MATT, the guy behind the STAX menues. Those are  no 148 and 149 now and so
they're very close to the high numbers of other compact bands.
But therefore the  stuff on the disx and the intros itself aren't mindmelting
or brainblasting. Both menues  containing the same intro as the 4 disx before
and I must say it again... NEVER use an intro two times, esp. if it's not the
best one. The  style of the  intro remembers  me to the old times on ST, it's
just shit...
And also the stuff on the disx  doesn't feature any stuff  you must get... On
menu 148 you will find several games, and it's all fucking old stuff.
Ok, here are the contents of menu 148:
1. FATEMASTER, a nice  RPG in  style of  the old  japanese  games like "Final
   Fantasy" or so, made by the dutch guys of Animal Soft back in 1992... It's
   without any doubt the best game on the disk...
2. ENTOMBED is another game, this  time from 1991, and remembers a bit to the
   old "Rick Dangerous" stuff. It's a jump'n'run, playing in Egypt.
3. SPACEWAR - THE NEXT GENERATION is some  kind of gravity/asteroids game for
   two players, also from 1992. It's not so funny and very simple.
4. TILES OSMOSIS, is a game by the french band CEREBRAL VORTEX  and up to now
   I didn't matched it to  understand the  meaning of this  puzzle game... It
   was released back in 1994 and is still a big mystery for me...
5. NEUTRON is a dull GEM game, I don't understand too... was made in 1995 and
   is the latest stuff on this disk. No worth a look.
6. Last but not least you will find an intro by SYNC, containing some adverts
   for their old AUDIO SCULPTURE tracker. Do you remember this thingie?! Ohh!
   It's from the good old times on ST...
All in one disk 148 doesn't  feature any needful stuff. Perhaps the games are
interesting for the one  or other, but  they were  released  hundred times on
other disx, ages ago... If I'm right "Entombed" was  also released on a .tnb.
games disk back in 1993 or 1994... and even this time it wasn't hot anymore.
Ok, next disk... the same  intro as mentioned  above. This disk features only
demostuff again. You will find on it the following stuff...
1. CINDY CRAWFORD EXPERIENCE by SUBLIME - it's just a fucking  lame slideshow
   by the band  consisting of SENSER/Vex^Sup^Thn and TRONIC/Effect... I still
   don't understand the meaning of this  slideshow. For what I should watch a
   demo with pictures in just 8 colours of a woman which isn't anyones fave?!
   I don't like  this stuff. It's  just senseless, even  if the first part of
   this demo features some  kind of style  too and I  like esp. the  music by
   ANTICHRIST of Sector One. Erm, and it's the best part of this demo. Ok, if
   you want to see that also in  1996 slideshows  don't  got more sense as in
   further years, get this demo.
2. SWEDISH NEW YEAR DEMO 3... because it's  a STE demo  I can't  say anything
   about it... but it's old too, be sure.

Conclusion: The STAX disx  are only  for collectors, not  for people  who are
            searching for the latest  stuffs. But  even if you make disk just
            to put  some things  together try  to make stylish  intros... The
            intros on this disx just tormenting  your eyes  and ears and will
            perhaps  activate your  vomit center. Hey Matt! Versuch mal etwas
            aktuelleren Stuff ranzukriegen! Es gibt weiž Gott noch genug! Und
            macht mal neue Intros! Ich kann sie nicht mehr sehen... Sorry...
