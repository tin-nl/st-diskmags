Hello pals and folx... it's moondog again, destroying some softwares.

Today I want to damage  the self-confidence of some british mag makers again,
hehe... I got  the latest  issue (the ST  version) of  MAGGIE and  after some
hours in front of my monitor I want to write some stuff about it.
At first some words about  my private  challenge to release  the UCM -BEFORE-
the new MAGGIE and let me say that I have managed it with only 2 days before!
Gronsch... a lot of hard work... esp. because  I already had  the information
when MAGGIE 25 will hit the lines...
Ok, now it's appeared, of course without leaving some words to our new shell,
'coz of the brill UCM-spreading-system it reached all the people the same day
or just a few days after the release.
Erm... and I'm really sad, because  I have to  make some  critizism again, on
the ST-shell this time! After I depacked the file and loaded the mag (without
an intro this time, at least on ST) I had to blink with my eyes because I was
not able to find out what was going on on the screen... a blue font on a blue
background... forget it! Even as I changed all the contrast and colours of my
TV-set to  the best it was  only a pain  for my eyes to read the stuff on the
screen. Esp. as I wanted  to see some screenshots  I was very disturbed about
this point. After  a few minutes  I restarted  the mag on my  good old SM 124
again and only on the good old monochrome  monitor I was able to read the mag
in a, let me say, very silent  way. Silent? Hum, the music  at the ST version
contained only one single bleep this time and then there was silence and even
if you're trying to restart the "music" nothing happened.
I hope that it isn't the  latest tick to release  the ST-versions of the mags
without music (just remember ECHO 7 and TOXIC 14...). Anyway we from the UCM-
posse will not let you die in silence, hehe...
Ok, the mag  itself features  the same  mixture of  articles of  all kinds as
every time. Besides the  usual news-corner  with special  propaganda part for
the RESERVOIR GODS (grin) and party-info you have also the known parts.
There are the latest  demos tested, for Falcon and ST of course, like the new
smashers "LIQUID SUNSHINE" and "DREAM DIMENSION" from DHS and "AMOK" from the
CONFUSIONS.
Very interesting  for me  was the  games-part  because there  were some games
re/previewed I had  never heard  of before. Besides the  wellknown stuff from
Sweden, "CORSAIR" by  IMPULSE  and "LOTUS" from  NATURE, there  was  an early
preview from a Falcon-jump'n'run  called "BLUM", another jump'n'run  for ST/E
called  "MOLE MAYHEM!" by  CROFT SOFT  and "TETRIS 2" for  STE and  higher by
BEAST SOFTWARE (?!) reviewed. At this point I want  to congratulate the mates
of the MAGGIE because they match it again and again to dig out stuff we never
have seen or heard from! Kewl! It shows that also gaming on Falcon/ST is also
possible today, even in a unspectacular way.
More software was reviewed with CAB v2.5, FLAYSiD v2.o (Hey mOd! Where is the
review of this utility you wanted to write for UCM 11, eh?!) and the UVK v8.o
(Wow! I have  still  version 3.1 in use...) and  last but  not least  several
commercial CD-ROMs were tested too.
Besides a very big fun and crap-corner you can find  several interviews, some
reports of different  ATARI shows (Atari Salon Paris  and so one), an updated
history of MAGGIE, music-reviews, a short diskmag corner with the latest news
from the mag-front, a  nice coding-corner  where you  can find the secrets of
coding 128byte intros.
Last but not least  there were some articles about the Internet (Websites and
funny IRC-clips), feedback and advertsincluded.
Not to forget the hidden article, esp. on the ST very easy to find. This time
the so serious MAGGIE informs us about cooking humans! Very interesting, eh?!
You can find informations how to carve a human body and so one... very crude!
But I like it, hehe... perhaps we try it sometimes =)
Besides all those things there are some goodies on the disk, like the PLAYSID
from CREAM including several  songs from the  last years ASSEMBLY, a horrible
old game (JETSET WILLY) for ST and other little stuff.
All in one  an usual issue of  MAGGIE, no  very special things, without a big
highlight (but it seems as they will have it for MAGGIE 26, because they will
be present on  the ALTERNATIVE PARTY, we  not... =( ...) but without weakness
in the contents, it's just nice to read...
Therefore the LowRes Menu  sucks this  time. Sorry, but on a TV SET it's only
tormenting my eyes and I'm happy that the mag will run on monochrome too.
Even if the grafix are on b/w not the best looking, it's better to read. Hum,
you can read  the articles  on LowRes  without  problems  too, 'coz the Delta
Force viewer features  several palettes, but the colours in the menu are only
unbecoming chosen. Perhaps  with real RGB-monitor  it's better  to read but a
load  of  people  still  using  just  a  simple TV set and  for  those little
differences in the palette  they aren't sharp enough. I hope for a better pic
in the background next time!
Final words: the MAGGIE  family has got  a new child and you should get it if
             you want to check out the latest informations from the big Atari
             world! It's  nice to  read, features several news, not only from
             the scene and also a load  of other interesting stuff! But check
             it out on monochrome!!!
