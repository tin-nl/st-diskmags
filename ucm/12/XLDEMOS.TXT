                      ATARI 8-BIT DEMOS - PART ONE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all. As Moondog asked  us, we bring you  now a short description of polish
8-bit atari demos. We start our story in 1993 and the 1st part ends in August
1996 when 'AssKicker' was showed - a real revolution.

So, let's start...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    INTEL OUTSIDE by OUR SOFT - 1993
                   ----------------------------------

code : Prix, Bulatronic
msx  : Daxey

At first we can see an intro and there is a funny 'Intel Outside' logo :)
After a while the picture dissapears and we hear wellknown music (it's one of
J.M. Jarre's Oxygene ). At this  moment appearing texts, something like films
captions :) and then the 1st part is loading...
When loading is  finished we can  see some sinus-scrolls. Then we have a part
where you can see a dithered plasma, it looks quite nice. Another effect is a
carpet of over 1500 dots, wow! It's really hard to do this on Atari XL ;)
And finally follows the most interesting part of this demo - vectors!!! First
we see a filled cube in fullscreen, which moves quite fast and very fluently.
Then there is a prism  with eight-angles in base, it can  be said that we are
in shock. After  that another  cube is jumping  around but.... this time it's
lightsourced!!!
As next we see some pseudo-textured solids and glence-vectors!....
Then we  can see  another cube. For a  while we  thought that the effects are
looped... wrong! ... And  suddenly the walls of this cube start to go away...
Now appears a new object on the screen, something  like a flying  bird??? But
that is not all... After  while we can admire other objects - 3D Atari (Fuji)
logo :), and then flies a brainblasting object into our screen - a helicopter
(with gyrateing screws) - it's  very impressive. At  the end  we see the last
object - a filled torus (36 poligons), and it's very nice, too :)
And this is all...

Grades:

code:    88% - good effects (as for theses times)
msx :    85% - excellent sounds by Daxey
gfx :    25% - nearly complete lack :(
design:  10% - totaly lack :((
------------
overall: 52%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     SWEET ILLUSIONS by SHADOWS - 1993/94
                    --------------------------------------

code : Konop, Jordan, Bartman
msx  : Bartman
gfx  : Dave

1st we see an intro, which invites us for watching the demo :)
I must say that music and graphics are very good. We can see some credits and
Shadows' members  introduction (there  are some  scanned pictures  and  short
descriptions). Next there are some effects like: shadebobs and sinus-plotters
(sic!). Another effect  is a part with very nice raytracing, but it's only an
animation converted from "Enigma" - amiga demo :(
Another part is quite interesting (and strange :)). On the screen is a vision
of mega-assembler?!? It's  something like  new tool presentation. The  source
files are loaded, next we see the compilation and another part is coming :)
There are some  vectors (wires, sic!), but  they are  very fast. You  can see
objects like: cubes, houses, pencils and oscyloscopes.
Another part is coming up - a nice plasma.
Next we have a screen with scrolls, stretched pictures and unlimited bobs.
Then are zoomers, track-scroll, morphings and a star-wars scroll.
And now it's  time for  the last part. Here  we see  filled, lightsourced and
glenzed vectors: cubes, prisms, pyramids and other solids.
Oh, there is a hiden part :) where you can see a roto-zoom!

Grades:

code:    80% - fast & nice effects
msx :    84% - very nice soundtrack
gfx :    70% - good refined, nice logos
design:  30% - whole is not synchronized with msx :(
------------
overall: 66%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        BITTER REALITY by SLIGHT - 1994
                       ---------------------------------

code : Seban, Rzog, Soused
msx  : Soused, Miker
gfx  : P.W.

Demo starts with a small crew introdution.
Then we have the 1st part, where a square is moving on sinus and other moves.
Next is time for  greetings. In top of the screen we see the same raytracing,
like in "Enigma". Another part and  another sinus-scroller (bee!) and picture
of Wrigley Spearmint gum :)
Next effect is  a plasma. But it's very impressive, it has 4352 colours! This
effect can reallyy shock.
And another part: we see some fullscreen and hi-res scrolls and kefren-bars.
Next part brings us some filled vectors. And then there are lightsources (one
solid is really brainblasting - there is something like metalic shading).
Next we see a  monochrome plasma, but  it's nice, too. Then we have unlimited
bobs, time for credits and that's all :)

Grades:

code:    75% - quite good level
msx :    85% - nice musics but 50% are converted
gfx :    80% - high number of colours, nice logos
design:  50% - all synchronized with msx
------------
overall: 73%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      BACK TO LIFE by TAQUART - 1995
                     --------------------------------

code : Jaskier, Electron
msx  : Greg
gfx  : Slaves

This demo  starts quite  interesting - on  the screen appears an oscyloscope,
where you can see the msx oscylogram. On the whole are added text introducing
the crew and demo.
Next we have  effects: fire and  blur. Then we see zoom-rotator with the crew
logo. Another effect - morphing: a  pen is  changing into  a plane, the plane
into a rocket, etc.
Next we see a  chessboard, which consist of a few levels. Then is time for...
track-scroll and plot-tunnel. And the last effects are vectors (only wires).
After all we have credits and greetings.

Grades:

code:    80% - orginal effects
msx :    85% - beautiful
gfx :    50% - primitive logos
design:  90% - real trackmo, all synchronized with msx
------------
overall: 76%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        OVER MIND by SLIGHT - 1995
                       ----------------------------

code : Seban, Rzog, Soused
msx  : X-Ray, Miker
gfx  : P.W.

At 1st we can see the title logo, on the backgroung we see lightnings, and we
hear sampled  sound of a storm. At next on  the screen  appears  a Sierpinski
triangle  and it's  realtime generated. After  a while we  see a track-scroll
with 1792 plots. After that comes a wiggle scroll.
Next we  see a generating  plasma, line  morphing and  Bezier curves. Another
effect - blured sinus-plotters, kefren bars, and time for greetings.
After that we see blured vectors: cubes, prisms, and pyramids. Next effect is
a fire, fractal counted and it looks very impressive and realistic.
Another part is Maltenbrott's fractals generator!
Next we see magnifying glass moved on the picture. After while we have shaded
bobs and a zoom-rotator. Then we see some sinus-plotters and great plot-ball.
At next appears a plasma and after that there is... real commanche.
Other effects are vectors and rotating textures, around x, y, z axis.
Then coming up a  vector dice and  zoomer (texture - woman  face) followed by
something  like vector film  about Stick-Man's adventures :) Our hero drinks,
walks and is dancing. Another effect is a fountain.
The demo ends with credits and technical info.

Grades:

code:    75% - better old effects, some new
msx :    90% - excellent soundtrack
gfx :    60% - nice pictures, but ugly logos
design:  95% - super synchronized with msx, no breaks
------------
overall: 80%

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                       ASSKICKER by SHADOWS - 1996
                      -----------------------------

code : Konop
msx  : Cedyn
gfx  : Titus

At 1st we can see a modest menu... it foretells nothing special...
But the  following appearance confuses :) On the begining you see a roto-zoom
with shocking speed and precision. After a while we see gouraud shading cube!
Wow!!! Then there is the same cube but... on his walls is generated a plasma!
#?$%&! Flash, and instead of plasma we have textures! But after a while these
textures are zoomed... and you can doubt that Atari XE/XL has 8-bit processor
and only 1.77 MHz!!! But if you think you are in shock, you are wrong!!!
Then we have a maze in Wolfenstain 3D style! Yes, a maze with textured walls!
Next effect - there is Konop's (main coder) face and it's blured and moving.
The last effect - vector but this time we see torus with Phong shading!!! But
it's too slow (about 1 fps, but you know 8-bit and 1.77 MHz).
Time for credits... and this is the end. An unforgettable experience!!!

Grades:

code:   100% - new cool effects (from 32-bit comps)
msx :    85% - to primitive, but fits to the whole
gfx :    85% - quite nice pictures
design:  98% - very well synchronized with msx
------------
overall: 92%
