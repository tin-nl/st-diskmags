Errr... what?! A preview of a demo?! Yep! A preview of a demo!
This time I decided to  wake up your  interest for a forthcoming new megademo
for the ST from France! Years ago the first rumours about  this demo appeared
but nothing happened. I heard something about it, but never saw a screen.
Finally I got a preview of this  longawaited demo last  year... and up to now
it isn't released, because of several bugs (the demo runs only on 2mb STs)...
Because of this and other problems (on every machine another problem occured)
I can't make a test... I don't saw the final and 100 % working version so far
just the latest preview at the InterJam'98.
But let me tell you something about it  and I think if you're still ST freak,
you will be anxious  to get this  demo! It's coded in  GFX basic and could be
the best GFA demo ever, if it will be released of course. The demo cotains an
intro, the  usual main-menu, a mainscreen, and two other screens  and you can
see a lot of different  effects. Some are  boring and  others not seen so far
coded in  GFA basic. And  so you have raster scrolling stuff, some kind of 1-
plane  texture  mapping, many  dots  stuff (spheres,  splines...), bitbending
scrollers, jelly  balls, unlimited bobs stuff  in fullscreen, the usual stuff
like chessboards, starfields and  so on, and last but not least a nice design
and a lot of  new and nice  grafics by  a very talented  newcomer  grafician,
STsurvivor... Ok, all in one  this demo doesn't feature any very new stuff or
extremely  extraordinary  effects, but  it leaves  a good  impression  of the
things you can do with  GFA basic if you're working also on the design, becoz
this demo features a lot of this design thingies like fading and rasterstuff.
Hum, only  the musics  aren't very original. Anyway  I can't  await the final
version, which will  hopefully run on my ST too... I will  not write too much
about the demo, because  it's just  a preview  and I think  they will perhaps
work out  the one  or other thing  up to the final  release and so I will not
give  any ratings too. Just  one paragraph: if  you like  ST demos (also with
old fashioned effects), get hold of this demo if you know that it is released
(and I really hope to see it this year!)...

ok... last but not least informations  about demos for your ST which will hit
your ST perhaps this year...

"Back In France" by Loud!/No Limit Coding
"...Do Things" by Cream
"Immortalize" by Wildfire
"Resurrection" by St Knights and .tSCc.
"Nostalgic-O Demo" by Oxygene, DHS, Cream, Checkpoint and others
and maybe some hot stuff by Checkpoint and Mystic Bytes

As you can  see after  years of  silence we have  on the ST demo scene really
some kind of resurrection, I've never  thought that  it will happen after all
the  horrible years. And  perhaps some others  are motivated  too, to release
something, as  you can remember  groups like  Stax, Dune (or at least the ex-
Dune people) or  Equinox have stuff nearly  ready to  release, complete demos
and screens  too somewhere on their disx... So new  releases can surely force
them to bring out there stuff for our pleasure!
