                                TAO of CREAM

=============================================================================

Hello TAO!

Because of the  fact that you are active like hell at the moment and you also
have  done the chipmusics  for UCM 11 and UCM 12 I have  decided  to make  an
interview with you. Let's begin.



UCM:       First tell  us a  little bit  of your  history. How did  you start
           computing and what groups you were in.

TAO:       My first machine  was a 600XL, which i got in late 1984. I used to
           play  games, code some  BASIC-stuff and converted C64-Musix to the
           XL, using "Softsynth", a damn good editor. Then, I guess it was in
           1987 when i  met a guy called "The Last Bit", who  owned an ST and
           showed me this game called "Ninja Mission" with this cool music by
           David Whittaker. I  bought a 512STm with a  single-sided drive and
           consumed masses of games until we met "Candyman" who showed us his
           Amiga-demos. I will  never forget this moment, when he said to us:
           "What are you doing with your computer? Playing games only?". That
           was really embarrasing, becoz he was right. On this day we decided
           to  learn 68000-code  and founded  a  group  called "The Technical
           Knock  Out". From  this famous  TEX-article i  learned  about  the
           structure  a music-player. After playing around with this article-
           player for a while, i coded my own one and an editor.
           In these days i did my only  game-musics for "Magic Marble", which
           unfortunately was canceled shortly before the release and for "Lin
           Wu's Challenge", written  by  Candyman. The  only  TKO-Demo, which
           could be  known was "Songs That Make You Go Mmhh", a collection of
           Hubbard-conversions  using  buzzers  and  digi-drums (Now  you now
           about the "II" in "STMYGM II").
           Short  after  this  release "Jacky" invited  me  to join the "ACF-
           Design-Team" and suggested me to change my name. I agreed to that,
           because my old name, which i used in my old gambling days, playing
           "The Great...Race" was  really  crap. The  rest should be known, i
           guess.....


UCM:       Have you other jobs apart from doing chipmusic in CREAM?

TAO:       After quitting  my studies  i'm looking  for a new direction in my
           professional life. Beside that i'm doing different jobs.


UCM:       The crowd may be bored of this one but who cares? How old are you?

TAO:       I'm around for about 29 years now.


UCM:       What is your current equipment?

TAO:       Totally  old-skool: 1040 STE  with 4 MB  ripped  from an old PC, a
           second disk  drive and a Pilips CM8833 Monitor with a damaged I/O-
           switch. The  only tools  i use  are "Turboass", "Neochrome", "Gfa-
           Basic" and of  course my own Music-Editors. For my web-stuff i use
           an old 486DX2, which i didn't have to pay for.....


UCM:       What is your fave game for the ST/FALCON?

TAO:       I  played "Wings Of  Death" "Speedball" and "Arkanoid" like hell.
           The last  good game i  played was "Obsession", although  i usually
           don't like pinball-simulations on a computer.


UCM:       What is your fave demo for ST/FALCON?

TAO:       Although  antiquated  today,  it's  still "The  Union  Demo",  the
           mother of all  ST-demos. And because of their originality in style
           and code "Oh Crickey..." and "The Cuddly Demos" are great.
           I haven't seen many Falcon demos  yet, but the best  one to me was
           Avena's "Sonolumineszenz". Tommy's soundtrack for it is great.


UCM:       What interests do you have apart from computing?

TAO:       Sports. Active as well as passive. If i have more  than three days
           without getting out of breath or  having wobbling legs, i get mad.
           I really  love  cycling. I'm  going  by bike  nearly everwhere. On
           holidays I get my cycling-bags and my tent together and go on tour
           preferably  in scandinavia, especially  norway. In my lame hours i
           relax by reading  a book or  just listening to music. Sometimes we
           get some  friends together  for just  hanging  around, enjoy  some
           groovy music and shoot some darts...


UCM:       Do you have any fave chip/Sid/FutureComposer music?

TAO:       I love Scavenger's tune for the "DBA-Mag 6" - intro. In my opinion
           it is  the best  chipmusic  ever  done  on an  ST until  now. Also
           outstanding   to  me   are  Mad  Max's  "Crickey"-menu  music  and
           "Beatnick" using his special arpeggio-technique. Somewhere I still
           have got  his FutureComposer-versions  of "Chambers of Shaolin" on
           tape, which  really impressed me when i heard them first. From the
           masses of  songs i had  to listen to while working on "PlaySid", i
           still prefer  Jeroen Tel's "Stormlord" and "That's The Way It Is",
           Hubbard's "Knuckle  Buster". My  absolute  favourite  SID-song  is
           "Task III" by an unfortunately unknown author.


UCM:       As long  as I can remember  I have never  heard any module by you?
           Have you ever tracked something?

TAO:       In my early days i tried, but it was  really crap. I stopped doing
           tracker  music, because  i got  tired  of  searching  for  fitting
           samples. I wanted  to be able  to have full control on the details
           and the effects. If  i have a special  sound on my mind, i want to
           be able to  change it immediately and in real-time. And i like the
           sport. That's  what the demo-scene  is based on. Trying to get the
           best out of this f...ing machine.


UCM:       Are you also  producing music  with synthesizers and what are your
           fave music styles?

TAO:       I  don't  do  anything  with  synthesizers. Sometimes  i  play  my
           acoustic-guitar  just to  relax myself. But i  won't tease anybody
           with it, because then i'd be the only one who relaxes... ;-)
           When i listen  to music, i'm  not fixed to a special style. I only
           get mad  when i  have to  listen  to these  german pseudo-american
           productions  like "Pappa Bear", etc. And  i'm really  bored by the
           actual "covermania" we have to suffer from.
           I prefer  Pink  Floyd, Genesis, U2, Van  Morrison, Steve  Winwood,
           Paul Simon as well  as Bjoerk, Depeche Mode ("Ultra" is great) and
           the so called "Gangsta Rap" with Dr.Dre, Snoop, 2Pac etc.


UCM:       Can you tell us  something about  your further productions? We are
           all waiting for your next demo which should include only SID-tunes
           on a simple STF. Any comments or is this a secret?

TAO:       That's  true. I wrote  a music player, which  is based on the SID-
           soundemulation of "PlaySid" so that i can use all of its features.
           The player will run on STF at 12 KHz as well as on STE and Falcon,
           maybe together with some kind of slide-show like in STMYGM II. The
           demo will be called "...do things." and is planned  to be finished
           this summer. Maybe  i'm going  to release  the new editor when the
           demo is released. And when this issue of UCM is out, you should be
           able to load "PlaySid ST" from  our newly styled website. Actually
           i'm supporting Leonard in his nostalgic-demo with some mostly pure
           chipsongs and a Union-Demo-tribute-screen.


UCM:       How did you discover the new technique called 'Syncbuzzer' that is
           used in your latest musics? (Something for the codeheadz!)

TAO:       I got  the idea, when  i was  working  on  the  soundemulation  of
           "PlaySid". 'Sync' is  a  Sid-effect, which  causes  some  kind  of
           harmonic  distortion of a wave. This  happends by  restarting  the
           wave of a  channel by  a second voice's frequency. That's what i'm
           doing  with  the "buzzer"-waveform-register (PSG $0D). A  timer is
           prepared  just like  for the SID-technique and instead of toggling
           the volume of a channel, i'm writing to the PSG-"buzzer"-waveform-
           register ($0D). You  can  create  really  strange distorted sounds
           with it. Syncbuzzer  is maybe  the most  important reason, why i'm
           going on making chipmusics.


UCM:       Do you see yourself as a living legend? (We do so :-)

TAO:       Of course not. Rob Hubbard is a living legend, nobody else.


UCM:       I've heard that you have coded also on SNES. Is this true and what
           have you done? Demos? Emulating your chipmusics?

TAO:       My  SNES-activities were  really funny, but  no big deal. Together
           with a  friend, who got a  hardware-manual, we played  around with
           the registers and  checked out its  capabilities. Although we have
           never "officially"  released  anything, I  recently heard  about a
           Freeware-CD containing the first little (lame) screen we did.


UCM:       Please tell us your  point of  view about the future of the Atari-
           scene.

TAO:       I'm really happy about the little revival of the scene, but we all
           have to face  the  fact, that it is still fading. We cannot expect
           the good times  to last forever. I  guess the  future will bring a
           scene  consisting  of a  few hardcorers  like on  XL or  C64, held
           together by the internet.


UCM:       BRAINSTORMING! Please give us a short comment on following topics.

ATARI         - No words left to say...

FALCON        - Born dead.

AMIGA         - The better machine, but somehow i did't like it.

PC & MS       - Useful.

DEMOS         - Could ruin your health. I'm still handicaped in walking after
                reading the 42K of the B.I.G.-Demo-scroller.  ;-)

SCENE         - The place 2 be.

CRACKING      - Better be creative.

INTERNET      - Rulez.

JAGUAR        - Impressive, but see -> "Falcon".

PLAYSTATION   - "Fifa Soccer" and "Tekken 3" rule!

NINTENDO 64   - Mario, Mario, Mario ....

VECTRONIX     - I get their newsletters.

ELITE         - Is there anything left to crack?

DISKMAGS      - Keep the scene alive, as far as possible...



UCM:       Have you any last words for the Atari-public?

TAO:       Yes,  keep going on and ...do things.


Many thanx for spending your time for us. Ceeeyaa!
