         - We are looking for attendees who would be interested in
   participating in a World of Atari Golf Tournament at the new Calloway
    Golf Center that will be opening in August. In addition, a Gran Prix
      Racing Tournament may be staged if there is sufficient interest.
       Please fill out our survey form, and please make a note in the
     "comments" section as to your interest (or lack thereof) regarding
    these two events so that we can figure out whether either of these
                          activities are feasible.

   - We need user groups and exhibitors (not vendors that want to exhibit
   at the show to contact us.  We are planning to provide a area for them
    to exhibit at a greatly reduced charge. In addition, we need to find
   out how many individual collectors would like to sell and trade their
    collections, etc.  We will be setting up a special room for them to
     exhibit and sell/trade their items. HOWEVER, they must sign up to
   sell/trade/exhibit -- there will be no walk-in sales allowed.  Anyone
     not signed up to sell/trade/exhibit and attempting to do so on the
    exhibit floor will be removed from the premises and banned from the
    floor. It is important to maintain the integrity of the show as well
   as making it fair to those who do pay for exhibit space and those who
    sign up to sell. Information for licensed businesses and vendors to
    purchase show booths can be found on the Vendor Booth Purchase Info
                                   Page.

     - Several legendary industry figures who were associated with the
      early era of Atari videogames and computers have expressed their
   intentions to attend the show. A list, along with brief biographies of
            the guests, can be found in the Special Guests page.
