This little ST demo made the second place at the INTERJAM'98 demo competition
and cames from the  youngsters SYNTAX, a crew which was born only some months
ago. YOYO, their coder, impressed  the people already  with his screens shown
on the ORNETA party last year and you can see his beloved effects, vectors!
The demo starts with a mediocre and strange looking SYNTAX logo. On ST a chip
music (an old one) from MAD MAX starts to play. On STE you can choose between
chip or tracker music, and this because of the cpu time needed to display all
the objects in an acceptable speed.
Ok, after the logo  of the band follows a "Reanimation" logo, very old styled
and in  horrible colours. (Just  a joke  from the INTERJAM'98... "So, it's an
old styled demo?! Yes, it's just a 'dream' in red and blue...")
It shows a twitching vector line.
Short after this  the main part of the demo starts. On the right side you can
see some kind of Electrocardiogram, a  red wave on a blue raster. On the left
side several vector objects coming up. At first some kind of a flying saucer,
as filled vector  with horrible much sides! After  this a texture mapped cube
is coming up, with  4 bitplane textures in 2*2 pixels  and after a short time
the textures began to zoom! Wow! Looks  really nice and I can't remember that
I have seen this so far on ST.
After that more texture mapped objects coming up, just  like geometric stuff,
an earth (really cool!) and a playing  figure from the chess game, again with
many textured sides.
Now a peace-logo was displayed on the  left side (again in the  polish design
colours blue and red =)  ...) and you can see this logo mapped on a torrus!
Cool too, but  horrible slow! And  after this  another torrus  cames up, also
with textures.
The last object is a pyramid with polish traffic signs and the main part ends
and after this another strange picture appeared on the left side meanwhile on
the right side the credits and greetings were shown.
End...
Conclusion: Hum... YOYO seems to be a good coder on ST. But it's not the best
            to say that  you need 16Mhz and  Cache to make  the demo run much
            more smooth. Just try to optimise the routines! Only a few people
            own a ST with "tuned" hardware  or a MegaSTE... And again, try to
            design your stuff! Perhaps its somekind  of the personal style of
            KLOCEK to use this  horrible colours, but they only tormenting my
            eyes! And what do you want with cool effects  when the demo isn't
            able to present them in the best way? The MAD MAX music isn't the
            best choice too, there  are a lot other musix around (and I don't
            mean SID stuff). The module is ok, but nothing special too...
            Because of this points this demo is just  mediocre! Sorry, but it
            seems as the word "design" don't  has penetrated the polish demo-
            scene so far... But this is the only real thing! Anyway, go on!
