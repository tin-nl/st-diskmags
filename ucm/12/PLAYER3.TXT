In the last days of April  another magazine reached  my mailbox and this time
it's again from Poland! With this magazine the polish scene brings 3 mags for
Atari alone (at  least of my knowledge). But the  problem is that they aren't
of any interest for the international Atari scene.
You ask  me why? It's  easy to  say. As the other  magazines, FILLER and ECHO
also the PLAYER MAG is  written in polish  only! I don't know why and I think
just one mag in their mother tongue is enough, because  even the polish scene
isn't big enough to support and save three different mags for a longer time.
Ok, in comparison with the other national scenes the polish one seems to have
the most people and members, but as the mags show they have a lack of writers
too and no foreign writer would join a completely polish oriented mag posse!
Anyway it's nice to have some new mags around, because with TOXIC, MAGGIE and
our own mag the scene has not too much of this stuff anymore. When I remember
the times we had about 10 interesting  mags at the same time the one or other
tear is rolling down my face. bla bla
Ok, what about some words about this mag?! It  comes with a little utility to
show the polish letters right  on every machine (I don't think that there was
a special  polish one =) ...). The mag comes with two versions for STF/Falcon
and STE (?), don't ask me why. Anyway it seems as  the STE and Falcon version
are coming with module music instead of the old chipsounds on a humble ST.
After starting the mag you will see a box where you can chose a sound for the
time you're reading the mag.
The shell design  isn't brainblasting, looks just like some motherboard or so
one and the chips containing the articles. The grafix aren't very stylish and
on my shit tv set at least the menu isn't easy to read.
The mag is fully keyboard controlled and it's easy to select and load the few
articles. Yes, a few... there are only 16 (!) articles included and this is a
bit too little. And as said  above, all are written in  polish only. So I did
not understand  just a single line. There were some news (especially from the
polish scene), some hints and tips and of course game reviews, ONLY! There is
nothing written about tools or demos! Just games, and not the latest...
In this point the  mag could have some kind of existance legitimation because
it's the difference to the other two mags which feature many other topics too
but as we all know the Atari machines aren't THE gamers  machines anymore and
so it's no wonder that all the reviewed games are some years old.
Another point in the menu is the possibility to load an old demo (from 1995),
coded  by YOYO  and his  former band -ZOKATHRA-, called "ALIVE". It  does not
feature any brainblasting effects, just  Mad Max musix, some flickering stars
and un proportional line vectors and several filled light sourced vectors too
at the end, filled up with some unspectacular grafix and logos.
Hum. Last but not least I want to mention that the viewer doesn't feature any
interesting  things, not even  a scrolling. You're  reading the articles just
page by page.
Final words: The  PLAYER MAG is all  other than  a high end  production and I
             can't understand the move  to go commercial (!) with this thing.
             I would say that  they will rip off  the users if they want some
             money for the mag! The shell and viewer  aren't state of the art
             and the polish language makes the  mag uninteresting for all the
             other Atarians outside  of Poland! For me the best polish mag at
             this time is ECHO and the PM is light  years away from them, not
             only because of the very limited topics.
