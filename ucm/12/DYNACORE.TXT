Hello Dynacore!

You are one  of the coders  of that overhyped  german  democrew. Hmm, now I'm
searching a good way from the introduction to the first question.


UCM:   First the usual stuff. How old are you?

DYNA:  Old enough to get some hard drink...


UCM:   What is your current equipment?

DYNA:  An old  STE is  still running  sometimes, but  I prefer  my Falcon for
       anything concerning Atari. Anyhow, I'm mainly  doing our homepage with
       my PC nowadays, so both machines became dust collectors (more or less)


UCM:   What is your fave game for the ST/FALCON?

DYNA:  Still I love Lethal Xcess the most...


UCM:   What is your fave demo for ST/FALCON?

DYNA:  Hard  to  name  that. I  like  Braindamage, The  Cuddly-Demos, as well as
       the  Ooh Crickey  or others  of that  great ST-Demos (yeah, there  are
       really a lot of them...)
       For the Falcon  it's obviously "Terrorize Your Soul", just  because of
       the great Number-of-Effects/Size-Ratio.


UCM:   What interests do you have apart from computing?
       Fave music for example.

DYNA:  Well, Comics like  Hardboiled, Sin City or just some of those american
       superhero-shit  like  Lobo (frag!). Then  I have  a special liking for
       hard and bloody movies, like Bad Taste, Braindead or recently Doberman
       For the Musik-Style: It  has to be  hard too: Sepultura, Machine Head,
       Pantera... But  then again  I like some good old Rock-Music too, as to
       say The Doors, Led Zep, or  The Alex  Harvey Band (BTW: Have  you ever
       recognized, that  the girls you  find  at rock-events  are a  lot more
       interresting  than those  stupid Techno-Girly-Pussies?). But if I'm in
       the mood I also listen to Primus (really some cool music - but nothing
       to hear all day long) or Techno, sometimes I really like that Electro-
       Stuffs Laser  is so in  love with... Hum, if I  had to choose the best
       Band I would vote "Marilyn Manson" at the moment, Antichrist Superstar
       Oh, and  not to  forget  Scooter, which  is really  the most beautiful
       music!


UCM:   You have  recently  coded a  nice intro  for the  latest .tSCc. module
       compilation, which  is Nr. 15  to be  precise. Have  you been paid for
       this, 'coz I know that you did not want to code anymore on Atari?

DYNA:  Well, if I  have to  prove if  some Ideas  could be  a great  and fast
       solution to any  kind of problem, I will do it. But if I have to write
       "something", because "there  is  once again  a  module-compile"... No,
       that's really no  motivation and makes me sick. There is no "happiness
       in slavery"...


UCM:   As you are a famous collector of things... I ask you... How many porn-
       pictures  are lying on  your harddisc? I want exact Megabyte-sizes and
       information on the motives you know???

DYNA:  What do you think? Harddisksspace is quite cheap these days and my aim
       is to get a CD full of data. And guess what? There are so many motives
       you find anything you like (or to get abused for)!


UCM:   How expensive was the plastic doll lying under your bed? You remember?
       'Smells like a real woman'... (don't deny it, we have prove!!!!)

DYNA:  Yeah man, one sniff of pussy and I'm lost...


UCM:   Warst Du das eigentlich  nicht, der da 20 Minuten in dem einen Kreisel
       rumgefahren ist, nur weil da eine Frau im Gras saû die sich Ihre Votze
       rasiert hat?

DYNA:  Der Duft war  einfach ÅberwÑltigend, was  sofort meine  Aufmerksamkeit
       erregte (und nicht  nur die  Aufmerksamkeit...) Aber hey, was sind das
       denn fÅr blîde Fragen?


UCM:   Back to  english. I apologise  to our  english  readers  for the nasty
       german shit above. Now  please can you give us a list where to get the
       best SadoMaso pictures on the net?

DYNA:  Hum, how about www.peitsch-mich.net or www.pleasure-slave.org?!


UCM:   How many times  have you offered  blowjobs to  the secretaries in your
       firm? ...be honest...

DYNA:  I offered to her?! Licking that old sore pussy? No way...


UCM:   Did the secretaries a good JOB?

DYNA:  Secretaries? There is just one.


UCM:   Can you give me their adresses?

DYNA:  You really don't want it.


UCM:   BRAINSTORMING! Please give us a short comment on following topics.

DYNA:  ATARI         -     Was the greatest for a long time

       FALCON        -     Was never that good as it could have been.

       AMIGA         -     Just another machine...

       PC & MS       -     The dominating technology/monopole

       DEMOS         -     Too boring these days.

       SCENE         -     Sick of all the hype

       CRACKING      -     Any computer need it, any softwarefirm hate it

       INTERNET      -     The real World

       JAGUAR        -     died to quick

       PLAYSTATION   -     Copiers delight

       NINTENDO 64   -     for games

       VECTRONIX     -     crackers

       ELITE         -     too

       DISKMAGS      -     have to live with it ;)

       TITTEN        -     "Titten-Tat" ;)

       MPEG          -     Animals!


UCM:   Have you any last words for the Atari-public?

DYNA:  Don't take things too serious...


Many thanx for spending your time for us. Ceeeyaa!
