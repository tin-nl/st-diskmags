
                       Atari Trackerscene Report
=============================================================================

As you will have  recognized, this kind of report is new. I believe it is not
that important  to update  this one all  the time. It  should just give you a
little impression, what  the "trackermusic-scene" (if we can call it that) in
Europe looks  like. (Furthermore, I had  really no  idea, what  else to write
about :)

The report will only include Atarifreaks. I think that's quite understandable
regarding the crowds of PC-musicans around.

"Trackers" are  here  people  composing  with  a tracker, both  soundchip and
musics  in mod-style or  people programming  trackerprograms  and other stuff
that refers to samples.

Although  this  report  is for  Atari, it  is not  too easy  to write it 100%
completed and right. Sorry for any mistakes.

If you can propose anything to add or to change, just tell me what.


Let's go!

SWEDEN:
=======

TOODELOO OF DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY / YESCREW

Well, here is the home of one of the most talented musicans, called Toodeloo.
He is very  very active. The  quantity of  DHS-music-releases can lead to the
picture of an always composing freak.
In the last weeks  he tries successfully to discover his "softer side", as he
tells. So you may hear some more funky and groovy tunes by him in the future.
I suppose his next pieces will be released in the game Capy by Yescrew.
You can download his latest tunes (around 2 per week) on his homepage.
Beside  the "regular" DHS-music-compilations, a  compile  under  the YesCrew-
label is planned as well.

THOMAS / NEW BEAT DEVELOPEMENT

If you know the  game "Willies Adventures", you will also now the funny music
in the background. This  masterpiece  in Jamaica-style  is one of the modules
composed by Thomas.
I am sure, somebody who did this tune, cannot simply stop composing.

STATUS: I would call him ACTIVE

MR.FUTURE

Well, this Swedish tracker presents his tunes on his homepage. He mostly uses
Octalyser to  compose his musics. Now, he  is quite busy with studies, but he
will not stop his work.
You should be concentrated  while downloading his mods, just because they are
zipped  and the  zipfiles have  passwords. I  don't know why. Just write them
down and type them in, as soon as there is need to do so.

STATUS: ACTIVE
URL:    Shit, I always forget it.. so better ask him on IRC (MRF)..

FINLAND
=======

CUBE OF AGGRESSION

I have  to admit, I  don't know, if  he still  composes  on Atari. He is just
sometimes  on IRC and  as a rumour  says, he has  composed  the music for the
Amok demo.

STATUS: Don't know.

now, he told me, he finished exactly 1 piece :)

You can contact him on IRC.

PERKELE

This  is the pseudo  of a single  finish coder  and musican, I don't know too
much about.

FRANCE
======

DMA SC OF SECTOR ONE

This froggy  accompagnies us  with his high-qualtiy  melodies through all the
different  productions of Sector 1. You  can listen to  some of it's tunes in
"MR.BOOMER", their new  game. Or try  the MOD in  the Demoversion of the DBE-
tracker. Yeah! This  crew wrote another tracker, that allows you to listen to
32 channel modules on a STe!

gone. You can download his musics on his homepage.

LAURENT DE SORAS

still works  on his Graoumf-Tracker  for Falcon. In  my eyes, it includes the
best compatibility regarding non-atari module formats, as S3M or XM.
Graoumf is shareware, registering can be done for only 30 DM.

SOFTJEE

are busy with  their Digital Home Studio, as  I hope, the best trackerprogram
for the Atari Falcon, so  far. Further, they released  some other soundtools,
as a Midiplayer or their great Digital Tracker.

Sorry, I haven't  the URL right here, but  you can find a link to them on the
DHS-site (http://wombat.ludvika.se)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POLAND
======

The rebirth-country of the Atariscene also presents us some good trackers:

RASTER OF CONFUSIONS

is the leader of this  group. Beside  his graphic-talent shown in Amok, he is
a good composer as well. He composes everything, from  hardcore-techno-tracks
to relaxed pianosongs.
If i am not too wrong here, he also ranked 3rd in the Orneta 4-channel compo.

STATUS: definately ACTIVE

TOOVEY OF CONFUSIONS

Listen to some of his nice modules in the Confusions-slideshow AMBLERY.

Well, was it "XTD" OF MYSTIC BYTES?

However, Mystic bytes have a new member, responsible for MODs. You can listen
to one of his first released tunes in their intro for Maggie 25.

Let's hope for another source of Modulecompilations, hehe..

STATUS: surely ACTIVE

CEDYN OF FREEZERS

A great  composer, recognizable  at his  strange and  cool  style  in all the
different Shadows-demos.

LEGWAN OF COBRA TEAM

Beside his graphics-activities  he also some funky modules. You can listen to
one of his pieces in the 3rd issue of the PLAYER MAG #3.

PRODIZ OF LUZAK TEAM

A composer :)

STATUS: I read they are always lazy... but ACTIVE

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SLOVENIA
========

VIDO OF YESCREW

composed  modules on its Atari. That is at least, what his homepage says. You
can have a look at: www2.arnes.si/~suduvido/index.html
But now, he has too little time for that.

STATUS: INACTIVE right now

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GREAT BRITAIN
=============

MSG OF THE RESERVOIR GODS

This crazy  vegetarian is, as  I suppose, the  most active  composer from the
island, where the cars drive on the wrong side :)
Some of his  best pieces (in my  opinion) are used in some of the millions of
RG-games, as "Static" or "SMB".

But  that's  not all  from this  productive  band. Their  other  musican (and
graphican) is called...

SH3 OF THE RESERVOIR GODS.

I don't  exactly remember  what this  letters meant. Either  "Sparehead 3" or
something like that. Sorry for that.
He is  no Protrackerfetishist as  MSG, he  rather  uses  the Graoumf-(fucking
name!)tracker. Listen  to his chilled modules e.g. in Maggie 25 (Falconvers.)
or listen to his great Frogers-theme conversation in "Bugger".

An interesting  thing about those 2 guys is their strong irregulary delivered
"Mod of the Month". But they seem to be too busy or whatever to be consequent
in keeping this "project" alive.
The last "Mod of the Month" was the  March-issue and it was  not even done in
1998 :(
But that  shouldn't be  underlined too  much here.. Both  musicans are simply
responsible   for  the  acoustic  part  in  the  nowadays  exemplary-numerous
Reservoir Gods releases.

THE NETHERLANDS
===============

Between cheese, grass and football, this country offers us some nice tracker-
musicans as well :)

THE BASSMENT

is a group of several musicans, that like the Atari. Their homepage says some
more about them. I don't really know what they are doing exactly, but they do
something.

MEISJE23 OF SENTRY

Their musican  and coder is  not only a  module composer. The 303-emulator he
programs wasn't finished at the Interjam, caused by some fat bugs, he luckely
found. However, excpect it to be released soon (or later:).

THE MATCH OF FUN

Yep, a  little update  by me (moondog)... This BOCKWURST =) is composing mods
and chipsounds (with ANIMAL MINEs SID SOUND DESIGNER) too on his Falcon. Just
check his works out in his productions, just like the game "SNATCH"...

LUEBKE OF PARANOIA

...is an excellent  musican as well. He primarily  does Soundchip stuff, that
should be hearable in the forthcoming productions of Paranoia.
You can also  listen to some modules by a member of Paranoia, who is inactive
today in the preview of their soon to be released game "STEtris".

THE CARDASSIAN SPY,

years ago, as NO/Escape convinced him of buying one and selling his PC. :)

MC LASER OF TSCC,

who gives its crew  some pressure to  release something, uses  Protracker for
his  very ambient  or electro-tunes. You  surely remember  those experimental
sounds in the recent UCMs.
He is also tormenting the AM SID SOUND DESIGNER since a few weeks...
He and SCY OF TSCC released  lots of  musics in their popular Modulecompiles.
Number 15 will be out at Interjam.
Both will surely release an entry for the Interjam music competition.

STATUS: MC LASER forever active, I suppose..
        SCY released a tune for the INTERJAM'98... but not real active, eh?!

TAO OF CREAM

The soundchip-wizard  is shocking all  listeners with his new technique, that
gives the old Yamaha-soundchip a kind of Sono-kick.
Listen to the song "Birth" in the intro  for the Module compile #14 by .tSCc.
and wait till the song has looped once.
Wow! I have no clue what or how he did that, but it's great to hear such cool
effects out of our simple soundchip.

STATUS: recently, he was ACTIVE, and he surely still is

He released a module again under this nick/label at the MEKKA/SYMPOSIUM'98.

STATUS: seems to be ACTIVE...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, as  you may have  thought, there  are not  masses of trackers on Atari.
However, I think, there is  no need  to call the Atari-trackers dead. I count
far more than 25! And those 25 are just people I know something about.
Surely, there  are a lot  of other  musicians, as  Stax/Lazer, Tyan aka Sirch
Retork etc. but I haven't heard anything about them since Siliconvention 97.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally, some  thanks have to go to Evil/DHS, for searching the Email and URL
-addresses for me. And  thanks have  to go  to GREY/MB for  telling  me a lot
about the Polish trackerscene at Interjam.
