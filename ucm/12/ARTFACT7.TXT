Welcome back to the seventh volume of 'aRt fACtORy', the article in which you
can  find ways  to improve  your  drawing  techniques  and get a lot of other
information  about computer-graphics in general. This time I am very proud to
inform  you that  from  now on  it is  possible  to use  pictures and unusual
characters  within the text, which makes understanding the explained issues a
better, esp. for you, the readers.

So what happened since the last 'aRt fACtORy' was released in UnderCover XI?

Firstly I have  to thank all the  people out there who voted me as No. 1 gfx-
man in MAGGIE charts. When I saw this result first, I couldn't believe it and
even  today I still  doubt about  this result. ...because  when the votes for
MAGGIE's charts  were collected, none  of the graphics released by me in some
productions  from .tSCc. or  POD were  in a  quality for  first  place. But I
truely hope this has changed now. ;)

Okay, eGO-tRiPPAz-part is over.

Secondly I can tell anyone who  is painting with  CRACKART V1.3o TT, which is
the last available version with  full use of functions, that the last version
of CRACKART, V1.36 TT, isn't  so good that  you really  must have it. I got a
non spreadable version  from a high qualified French graphician (you know who
you are, but I  don't want to  mention your name here because you would drown
in mails from people who also want to have it; but again: thanks!), but after
I tested it  a bit, I was kind  of disappointed. The only cool thing about it
is a new function  in the FILL-options  and a new  game in MINESWEEPER-stlye.
The improved  fill option allows  you to fill defined areas with color-ranges
in very  special degrees and  very different  dithering-styles. When you play
around a bit with it, you  can get really  nice results. But it is truely not
too necessary.

Finally, there's  a gallery  of some of  my pictures  in cyberspace now. Just
check  out  www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uno4/modart.htm,  which is, as  you  surely
already recognized, part of the .tSCc. homepage. In this gallery you can even
check out some unreleased graphics, such as some of the RESURRECTION demo.
The gallery will grow  constantly. After  I painting new  graphics I will put
them  in there. (okay, to  be honest, there  will be  some gfx  that won't be
shown  there before  the release  of the production  they were made for!) The
latest pictures added can be found on the top of the picture-list.

So now let's start with the serious themes of the article, beginning with...


I. Competition!
---------------

YES, you are  right! This time's  special bonus in the aRt fACtORy is winning
a logo of  your crew, done  for YOU  by mOd of .tSCc. (hehe, I  know  this is
really lame.
But after so  much groups asked me to do gfx for their productions, I thought
this would  be the  best way...) Things  to do are really easy this time. You
just  have to  send an  email or  a postcard  to me  with the  answer  to the
following question:

.---------------------------------------------------------------------------.
| -  - Where have I found the saying  you can see on the right part of -  - |
|     - the LOADER-screen and what  are the nexts lines of this text? -     |
'---------------------------------------------------------------------------'


Write the right answer to...

                  jur96mct@studserv.uni-leipzig.de

                                                   ...or via snail-mail to:

               Torsten Keltsch - Kreuzdornstr. 20 - 04329 Leipzig - Germany


From  all right  answers that  are sent  in till  the release  of  UnderCover
Issue 13, ONE answer  will be raffled from  a box where all the right answers
lay in. After  that the winner  will be informed by me PERSONALLY. Then it is
_his_ job to tell  me the style of which the logo should be! I oblige to draw
it within two weeks.

SO C'MON DUDES, LET'S TAKE PART IN THIS COMPETITION! IT'S REALLY WORTH IT!

People that  CANNOT take part in the competition: members of .tSCc., Poets of
Decay, Earx of FUN and PC-groups in general. (hard rules, ehh? ;)

And here's even  a small hint for all of you interested in logo-stuffs by me:
the answer to the question is really _not_ "the first line" of aRt fACtORy 6"
where I've  also mentioned  this  saying. It  has more  something  to do with
music, done by an old and honourable British band...


II. Some words about the lousiest LOADER-picture of UCM ever!
-------------------------------------------------------------

mOd says: "It is shit and I really DOUBT that anyone will like it."


III. Some more words about the same thing.
------------------------------------------

Besides that it was the hardest work I ever had while painting a picture. The
whole story  began in December 1997 when  I checked  out Germany's maybe most
known mail-order catalogue by OTTO, in which the girls are pretty nice. ;)
In the section for Lady's Underwear I saw this gal and well, I said to myself
that she's  the one  if I paint  another  picture. In the beginning I did not
know for what production I should paint it.
RESURRECTION? InterJam Competition? Or UCM?

You know how I decided.

Strangly enough, I did not began to paint till April 98, although I had a lot
of time  to do it. But  within these month I had a lot of time to think about
the style of the picture and how it should look like in its final state.

My inspirations came from:  a) an "old and honourable British band" ;))
                            b) advertisments in some magazines
                            c) grafix by Haplo/Orange
                            d) musics by 5o5/Checkpoint
                            e) cycling in my hometown's parks and nature

All in  all it took  me 9 days of  painting to finish the picture completely.
(This means from  the very first  line of the face's outline to the very last
point in the mOd-logo.)

I guess it would  be a quite informative  to write the next aRt fACtORy about
the way  I painted the whole  pic. I will try  to describe you every step and
will also include some pictures of these steps. What do you think about that?


IV. Workshop: Wild-dithering explained!
---------------------------------------

And now for something completely different: the practical bit! Yes, it's time
to get some more knowledge in pixel-drawing...

In this issue of aRt fACtORy, I'd like to teach you a way how to increase the
quality of you pictures a lot: DITHERING. You surely played a bit around with
your favourite  painting-software before and you may have recognized that the
egdes  between two  color-areas are  looking  quite weird, esp. when you've a
white next  to a black area. The bad thing about it - mainly on machines with
a low  amount of  colors, such  as the ST - is  that you  haven't  got enough
colors to make a color range via grey colors.

The situation may look like this:

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 6 0 59}

Not very  cool, hmm? Well, and  for this  situation, some smart dude invented
DITHERING. This means to make a more or less smooth tone for one color to the
other by setting pixels in a special method.

Maybe ten years ago, dithering looked like this:

{*i artfact.pi1 m 13 19 59 118}

Not very cool you say? Well, you are damn right.
But  after  some time  graficians  began to  use new  techniques  to make the
dithering look  a bit better. Examples  for good  dithering  in the old times
were  SPAZ/TLB, JMS/AM or NIKO/MJJ. The  last mentioned  had a  very  special
dithering-style  that  looked  a bit  like  Floyd-Steinberg - it  was  really
astonishing!

Then, one  day in 1994, I thought  of some kind  of an "own" dithering-method
and I  began testing  on one  picture. This method improved a lot till today,
but the  first structures  are still the same. And  I want to descibe you how
this works - so YOU can dither your pictures in a good style, too!

A) You have  part in  your picture  where two colors run into each other. Now
   paint  a chessboard-line  of at least 2 pixels height all around the edges
   of the one color-area. The bigger the space you have to dither, the higher
   these chessboard-lines must be. You will soon find it out by yourself!

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 6 59 118}

B) Now paint some pixels within the same chessboard-style in the lower color-
   area. You  may set  the pixels  in every  way you  want, but please always
   paint  them within the  chessboard-offset! Never  set one  pixel  right to
   another.  Always  paint  the  pixels  diagonal  to  the  other! It's  very
   important, so please keep it in mind!!!

{*i artfact.pi1 m 0 6 118 177}

C) As next, do  the same steps explained under B), but this time in the other
   color-area (here: above). Pay  attention  to the fact you should dither in
   this step very varied. Try several forms!

{*i artfact.pi1 m 6 12 0 59}

D) Now a step with only some very little  changes. If you check out again the
   picture  shown  under C), you  may recognize  that there are still the two
   chessboard-lines from our first painted step. And this looks not too cool.
   So  let's remove  the pixels  that may  remember us of the "old" two pixel
   high chessboard-line!!

E) Set pixels in  every way you want in the one color-area! The don't have to
   bet set in the chessboard-offset, but shouldn't be set one to another. The
   farer  you are  from the "borderline" of  the colors, the  less pixels you
   should set! It's the creativity bit, so play a bit around!

{*i artfact.pi1 m 6 13 59 118}

F) The same in the other direction.

{*i artfact.pi1 m 6 13 118 177}

And ready is a fine dithering done by hand, looking like Floyd-Steinberg!
Have fun testing and improving your dithering-capabilities!

V. Franz Kafka: "Die Abweisung"
-------------------------------

Wenn ich einem schînen MÑdchen begegne und sie bitte: "Sei so gut, kommt  mit
mir" und sie stumm vorÅbergeht, so meint sie damit: "Du  bist kein Herzog mit
fliegendem Namen,  kein  breiter  Amerikaner  mit   indianischem  Wuchs,  mit
wagrecht ruhenden Augen, mit einer von  der Luft der RasenplÑtze  und der sie
durchstrîmenden FlÅsse massierten Haut, Du hast  keine  Reisen gemacht zu den
groûen Seen und auf ihnen,  die ich  weiû nicht wo  zu finden sind.  Also ich
bitte, warum soll ich, ein schînes MÑdchen, mit Dir gehn?"

"Du vergiût, Dich trÑgt kein Automobil in langen Stîûen schaukelnd durch  die
Gasse; ich sehe nicht die in ihre Kleider gepreûten  herren Deines  Gefolges,
die SegensprÅche fÅr Dich  murmelnd in  genauem Halbkreis  hinter   Dir gehn;
Deine BrÅste sind  im Mieder  gut geordnet,  aber Deine  Schenkel  und HÅften
entschÑdigen sich fÅr  jene Enthaltsamkeit;  Du  trÑst ein  Taffetkleid   mit
plissierten Falten, wie  es  im  vorigen Herbste  uns  durchaus allen  Freude
machte, und doch lÑchelst  Du  -  diese  Lebensgefahr  auf  dem  Leibe - bis-
weilen."

"Ja, wir haben beide recht und, um uns dessen nicht unwiderleglich bewuût  zu
werden, wollen wir, nicht wahr, lieber jeder allein nach Hause gehn."



Okay, that's it for this time. In the end I like to send fat chicks to:
- Agent -t- of CREAM
- ST Survivor of Loud! (Keep on  painting, pal! The scene  really needs  your
  good work! You really motivate me!)
- SH3 of RG (for not sending me any email anymore)
- The Paranoid (never judge a book by it's cover!)
- The Match/FUN (funniest conversations at InterJam!)
- and last not least to Meisje23 and XTC1 from SENTRY (for surely not reading
  this article and not releasing TB 3o3-emulator before January 2o14).
