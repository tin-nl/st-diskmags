                        PREJUDICES AND THEIR TRUTHS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am pretty motivated  to write this text. Probably  because the issue I will
write about is something, I experienced some minutes ago.

It was aimed  to be one of those  funny IRC-sessions in the evening. Today we
have the 2nd of June, by the way.
It was like often  before in  the last time. #ATARI was invite only..(who are
these lamers?)
Of course I  visited #ATARISCNE  aswell, but  there was  nobody, except these
"partycycle",  and  "somebody"-guys. Well, I  wanted  to  chat, so  I  joined
#AMIGASCNE, a channel I was told about somedays before.

Hmm... many guys here.
The first thing  I asked was, if there were any 4-channel musician around. So
well, as expected, since  the Amiga-scene is the origin of 4-channel modules,
there was one.
He asked me, what for I want such a module. Strange question - for listening,
I told him. He finally  asked for my email, and told me that he will send one
module to me. I was quite surprised, about the nice guys there, in #AMIGASCNE
Ok, I didn't expect  a channel full of  lamers, but most I heard about Amiga-
freaks up to now, was similar to PC-users.

The Amiga-musician  told me, the  email  would arrive  me soon, and  left the
channel. Yeah. A nice guy, I thought. And indeed, an email arrived me.

But as soon  I started to  download, I had to read, that I have to download a
13 Megabyte big (mod)file! Big mails like those are very problematic for some
servers, also  for my one. I immediately thought, this guy sends me a fucking
big crap-file just  to fool me. In my  eyes, he wanted to "destroy" my email-
thing purposely.

So I began to  curse this damn  Amiga-lamer. In my  eyes, he represented, the
whole  lameness  of the  Amigascene.. trying to  fool everybody  as often  as
possible. I  really wanted  to write an  article, to show everybody about the
Amiga-lameness. I got a kind of aggressive.

Aggressive, until  I recieved  the mail very  fast, not  being 13 MB, but 400
kilobytes. It was a fault in the email program (Netscape mail btw :) ..

The Amiga-musician just  sent me a modfile  as promised, beside a little nice
text..

I was so  lame! I am  sure, I don't  have to  tell anybody  how bad  or wrong
prejudices  can be. You  all know  that, I suppose. But  I was sure, I'd know
that, too. I  was wrong. I condemned  a whole scene, caused  by such a little
shit. Embarassing somehow.

Somehow, I am  wondering, what  my  brain  did to  me, causing  that  extreme
feelings and reactions about such a small issue.. maybe I am a bit sick in my
head (very probable, as I am in the demoscene :)

I am not even  sure now, why  I am writing  this text. I am  not sure. I just
wanted to, as much as you wanted to read it.

Of c ourse, this  story is  nothing that  makes you  say "boaaaahh!!". I just
wanted to write it.

By the way, any prejudices growing in your head about me now?   :)
