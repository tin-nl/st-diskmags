
                  The art of conversation  is sadly no more
              So he talks to himself  as he passes closed doors

                    Now no one walks, a lonely pedestrian
                 Greys, blacks and greys is only reflections

                            Stranger than fiction

                   His nightly stroll,  a policecar patrol
             Caught in it's beams  sweet explodes from his pores
                    No listed excuse to be out after dark
                The car door springs open then silently shuts

Subject :  The purpose maker (Falcondemo)
Producer:  DJedi (France)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only Falcon  demo that was released  on the last Volcanic party in France
comes from  an unkown coder  called DJEDI (don't know how to spell it :-) and
it's quite promising  for the first  demo. The purpose maker is a music label
from  Jeff Mills  from Chicago  and I  guess it's some  track from Jeff Mills
himself that starts playing. Old school Chicago house music!
On a green  background a  purpose maker logo  appears. It's in the same style
like the Jeff Mills logo.
After that  some sort of  tunnel comes up. Lotsa  colours. It looks like some
kind of  rainbow. The next  effect is  some glass marble  rolling over a nice
picture in 'Giger-Style'.
Right after that  a melting effect comes up like TAT did it on the ST for the
last Maggie intro he  did. This one was already featured in some other Falcon
demos like Geranium.
In the  right bottom of  the screen a little 'Don't cry' logo  appears and in
the  middle of  the screen  a tree created  out of  dots begins  to grow  and
becomes bigger and  bigger. After a little while the tree shrinks again and a
little vertical endscroller comes up.
