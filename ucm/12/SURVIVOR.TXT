
                   ein kalter blitz durchbricht das dunkel,
                   ich hîr das klopfen deines herzens.
                   die nacht ist eine sinfonie,
                   aus vogelschrei und kaltem wind.

                   der todesengel schleicht vorÅber,
                   von hÑusertÅren rinnt das blut.
                   die stille, sie ist fast vollkommen,
                   nur in der ferne weint ein kind.

                   ich wollte singen von der grausamkeit,
                   als sei sie nur ein wiegenlied,
                   wollte singen wie ein minnesÑnger,
                   der klÑglich unterm fenster steht.

                   in der einen hand halte ich die laute,
                   trÑnen rinnen Åber augen
                   in der andern hand da blitzt die klinge
                   ich zîger noch doch ich zeig risse...

Because I didn't matched  it to test those  screens for the last issue I have
started a second try now.
This little band, consisting  of PTIF and  TELSUD appeared  last year  on the
french  ST-scene and as  fast as they appeared  they're gone  again. But they
don't left the scene, they just joined TYPHOON. And since this date they also
did some more screens, mostly of better quality. You should know that they're
some kind of nostalgia fans. Their  old screens looking like screens from the
beginning of the ST scene. They have released  three screens  under the label
"SURVIVORS" and I got them already in January.

The first one  is  called "CARPET". It starts  with a black  screen. A little
blue scroll says "Music" and a  chip sound by  MAD MAX starts to play. And so
it goes on. The scroller always says that the  current stuff on the screen is
boring and so one effect follows after the other.
And so you can see  a double  chessboard scroller  in red/white, a  starfield
with  distorting  Motorola and Atari  logo, a mirrored  starfield, a blinking
TSV-logo and a swinging scroller.
Oooh gorsch... all looks so fucking old fashioned! The used colours are dull,
always plain black background, old music and boring effects, sorry guys! Even
for a group of beginners it's not the best release!

The second screen is  called "FIRE AND ICE" and brings beside a TSV logo (not
anialiased... hurrr...), the  contact adds with distorting one-plane-logos in
the background, an bending glass-scroller and a music by MAD MAX again.
Hum... not special and not worth to be mentioned here.

The third and last screen is called "THE X-FILES". Hum. There is a more plane
starfiled in the  background, a big  Xfiles-logo, a blinking  TSV-logo on the
left side and a jumping barcode and a distorting alien on the right side.
Below all there is  a small scroller  and last  but not least  there is again
only MAD MAX music. There is a little joke included. If you're pressing space
the music  stops and an  earth appeared on the screen and besides a big "THEY
ARRIVE!" you can see a load of green blinking flying saucers.
Hum. The style of this screen is all in one the same as the others.

Conclusion: these screens are only for nostalgic freax and collectors. Sorry,
            but in the year 1997 you  have to show  much more to  impress all
            the surviving  Atarians. Ok, it's  nice to  have  some newcomers,
            but it seems that they lived on a small island without contact to
            the real life and  they didn't noticed  that at least some design
            is needed today. Plain black  backgrounds are outdated  since the
            first design  demos made by  DIAMOND DESIGN and  OXYGENE. MAD MAX
            music doesn't impress anyone today. And last but not least the fx
            are not worth to be  mentioned. 10 years  ago all  had said "Wow!
            Cool screen!" but  today it's only  boring. Sorry! Anyway  I wish
            you all the best under the TYPHOON-label! I  hope I don't destroy
            your activities with my critics.
