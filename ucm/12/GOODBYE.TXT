This little demo was released by the Swedish ultra-productive team ñDHSð on 1st
of april in 1998.
After  selecting  your favourite  screen-mode in the well known selector, the
screen  is  set in  black color, a sad  piano-tune  by ñToodelooð is played and
several texts are written to the screen, using a white font.

But WHAT THE HELL are ñDHSð writing there?


      ñLEAVING SCENE?
                                         óSTOPPING DEMOCODING?

                  òIT WAS A NICE TIME ON ATARI?

                                         ñFINAL GREETINGS?
          óSELLING THEIR ATARIS?ð


Well, ñDHSð are telling us that this  is their  last production  and  they stop
coding. And  according  to ñEVIL/DHSð, more  than ó10ð guys  wrote  mails  to ñDHSð,
wondering  if this is  really true.  Hehehe. What a great  joke. These people
must have  been  from countries  where they never heard anything about april-
fools... Or maybe they take their whole life a bit too serious. ;)

But don't worry, guys! ñDHSð are still on the track and there's more to come!

Thank you ñDHSð for such a nice april-fool demo. (In fact, you don't fooled me,
'cause ñEvilð already told me two weeks before the release...)


I guess a  rating is not  needed for this production. It  fulfilled its sense
- fooling people - quite good and this is the best rating it can get!
