Huuuuursch... BUGS ALWAYS INCLUDED...

As you surely have recognized  there were a load of bugs in the last issue of
the UCM!
- At first I'm so sorry  that you don't had  module sound on Falcon! I really
  don't  know  why. The file  is included (called "IRRLICHT" and  composed by
  MC LASER) but it seems that the mag doesn't load it. Erm... don't know.
- But therefore you have TAO's music (!). I also don't know why. And you will
  miss 5o5's  music. Chaos! I thought that EARX had not managed it to include
  TAO's music and  thought it's 5o5's (without  checking the  file which EARX
  had sent to me...). So I don't gave TAO the credits... I'm so fucking sorry
  for this. 5o5's music is so included in this issue too...
- BONUS' article about acronyms was  included but can't be loaded. Don't know
  why. We have included it again.
- More bugs: errors by clipping out the big font (only the half of "W" and no
  "!") and also some errors by the little font (the "[" was missed even if it
  was included). Hopefully removed...

So also several features from the old magazine were missed and I hope they'll
be included again sometimes:

- raster bar for chose the articles
- status and title bar in the lower and upper border
- music selector on ST (and theoretical on Falcon... files mostly too big)
- fading routines
- remove the jump to the top of the main menu
- perhaps some other little features...

Anyway it can be that the current issue could run on the PaCifiST too, we had
no possibility to check it out...

We're so sorry for all these errors and wish you a better read in the current
issue...
