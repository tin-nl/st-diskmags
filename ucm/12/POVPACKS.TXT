                   NEW -PERSISTENCE OF VISION- COMPACTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a very long break the oldest still active compilation band striked back
in autumn last  year. Hum, I think it's  better to speak of the master behind
the  band, MAC SYS DATA, because he's the  last active  member and since long
time alone responsible for all the releases under this label.

The band started  back in 1989 and  that they're still  here seems to be some
kind of wonder. But the  things changed  and so also  the P.O.V. menus lost a
lot of the old style. Today you  can find mostly old, very old stuff on them.
Ok, I must admit that sometimes also screens or demos are included which I've
never seen so far, but I miss the actuality very much...

I got now two of the new packs, volume 150 and 160. The strange thing is that
No 150 was  released  later than No 160. But MSD isn't  the only  one who has
problems to release the packs in continuous numbers.

...pack 150..................................................................

Anyway the pack 150  seems to a special  birthday pack. All screens on it are
done by MSD himself. You can find the following stuff on the CD:

GRODEN      - it's STE demo for 1mb machines, haven't seen it so far...
RAVE        - it's a techno-screen with the  tune "Hardcore Vibes" from 1995,
              features nothing  more than  this module, several  infos  and a
              strange logo...
SHADED BOBS - another very simple screen, you have big shadebobs, a logo at
              the beginning and some quartett or tracker sound
UNLIMITED BOBS - another screen, with unlimited bobs ofcourse, some chip-mod,
                 logo and scroller...

Other stuff is the usual POV disk copier coded by BORIS of P.O.V. and an info
screen with all  the contents  of the  several  menus up to  volume 149. This
screen features also tracker music and is horrible colourful.

The intro/menu of this pack was coded by Spaceman Spiff and features a little
soundchip music, a starfield, again a strange POV-logo and the usual scroller
and rasterstuff. There must  be a second intro on the disk but it doesn't run
on my STFM.

...pack 160..................................................................

This pack was released  one month before 150 and brings several old demos and
screens. The intro of the pack is the same old  stylish stuff as always, with
scroller, rasterstuff, sound analyzers and logo and remembers to the good old
time of Atari compact makers...

The disk contains the following stuff.

NECROMUNDA - a very strange  designed music  demo by  PARANOIA from  the year
             1994, reviewed in an older issue of the UCM. This  demo features
             a very strange design, several  quartett music  stuff and only a
             few effects worth to be mentioned.
FAREWELL   - this is the ast demo by PASSION for ST, released back in 1993. I
             haven't seen this demo so far. It features some nice grafics and
             several  effects  like  shadebobs and line  vectors. Not bad but
             even back in 1993 it was already outdated.
FUTURE MINDS COMPIL 25 intro - a nice plasma intro  with some dots-stuff too,
             also made by band who died years ago.

On the disk you'll find the usual disk copier program too. That's all.

...final words...............................................................

The PERSISTENCE OF VISION compacts are only  thought for  collectors, who are
searching also for some old and rare stuff. The whole collections remembering
very hard to the  early days of compacts on Atari ST. For people who are only
interested in the latest screens and so one should take the ST COLLECTIONS by
TYPHOON.
Anyway it's nice to see one of the oldest compact-series on ST back on track,
always with oooould  styled but  original menus  and not  only thousand times
used intros again.
Keep up your good work man!
