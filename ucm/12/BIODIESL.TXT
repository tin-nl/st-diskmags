=============================================================================

Well, maybe you have already heard about this source of energy. It is a great
alternative to the ordinary Diesel fuel.
If you  are using  a Diesel engine  in your  car, this  may or  better should
interest you.
Biodiesel is produced out of rape. The oil you get out of rape is, after some
more or less interesting  chemical procedures, 100% usable as fuel for almost
any cars, driven with Diesel engines.

It offers lots of advantages towards other fuel, as:

- Biodiesel  supplies the  agriculture, it  can  make unexploited fields used
  again -> so Biodiesel offers new jobs and income sources as well!
- Biodiesel can be used mixed with ordinary Diesel or just single
- you can always  choose, wether you want to use Diesel or Biodiesel, because
  both kinds of fuel can use the same engine
- Biodiesel cares the engine, it has a higher "smear-ability" (or whatever it
  is called in English) than normal Dieselfuel
- further it removes unusable dirt (from the normal Diesel)
- Biodiesel is biodegradable! -> pollution of water or soil is impossible
- Biodiesel (rape) can grow anywhere in Europe without any problems
- Biodiesel is a regeneratable source of energy!
- Biodiesel releases  less CO2 than other fuel => the rape reuses most of the
  released CO2
- Biodiesel produces very little pollutants in general!
- Biodiesel is cheaper  than any other fuel (for Biodiesel there is no tax on
  oil, as on normal fuel), at least this is claimed by everybody...(today one
  litre Biodiesel costs circa 1,10 DM)

You can say without any doubt: Biodiesel links economy with ecology.

So, if you  have a Diesel  engine in  your car, why don't you try it then? As
far as I know, nothing bad can happen, while trying it.
Only  some  few cars  use some  plastic stuff  in the  engine, that  could be
destroyed. So better first ask the workers at the petrol station. They should
be able to help you.
If you own  one of the  following cars, there  will be 100% no problem, while
using Biodiesel.

Since you surely won't own that new cars, I propose you to ask the workers at
the next petrol station offering Biodiesel again.
The power of your engine will not be less than before, in contrary, Biodiesel
cleans your engine.

I found a list of petrol-stations, that offer Biodiesel. Unfortunalty it  was
in Germany only :(
Further, the list is to long to include it here (the list would take 200 kilo
bytes) so I skipped it.
I just  mention, that  there are  more than  one Biodiesel-stations  in every
bigger town and at least one in every smaller town.
If you have any questions, ask me (fiveofive_cp@hotmail.com) or look for some
sites in the Web (there are a lot).

I hope there is no need to explain, what I want to achieve with this article.

                                                   Just TRY it..
