
               The summer sun is fading  as the year grows old
                      and darker days  are drawing near
                     The winter winds will be much older
                            Now you're  not here.

              I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
                       and one by one  they disappear.
                        I wish I was flying with them
                             Now you're not here

             Like the sun through the  trees you came to love me
                    like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

            Through autumn's golden grown we used to kick our way
                     You always loved  this time of year
                   those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here

             Like the sun through  the trees you came to love me
                    like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

                 a gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
                         as if to hide a lonely tear
                       My life will  be forever autumn
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here

             Like the sun through  the trees you came to love me
                    like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

            Through autumn's golden grown we used to kick our way
                     you always loved  this time of year
                   those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here
                           'cause you're  not here

It is a fucked  up day and I'm  listening to  the soundtrack from 'war of the
worlds'. Some  days ago I  surfed the  web and  found a  nice link on the DHS
guestbook never seen before. I came to the page from KEVIN CALLAHAN who coded
a new clone of the famous Dynablaster called BOMBAMAN!
As an old  Dynabusters... blaster... Bomber... Žhm... fan  I did not hesitate
to download the Shareware version.


THE FASTEST, MOST FUN MULTIPLAYER BATTLE GAME AVAILABLE FOR THE STE is one of
the first sentences to can be read on the textfile. Naaaaahh... most fun!?!?
;-) I hate such declarations. Let us see if the author keep his promises.

The authour says that the game is coded in 100% Assembler and (everybody know
that) this is a bonus for a review ;-). The game features: Blittered sprites,
DMA (Pre-Emptive-Prioritised) Sound, Palette  Switching, Lower Border removed
for extra playarea, 50 Frames Per Sec and chip music (not much impressive but
looks like it's selfmade).

In the Shareware  version only 2 players can battle against each other but in
the final version up to 4 players should have that possibility.
The graphics look very similar to Dynablaster but they are anyway quite good.
The  gameplay is very  simple (for  those who don't know it yet). You can lay
bombs  and you  have to  defeat all the  other players on the screen. He also
included  samples and you  can kick bombs... I have to say that he has nearly
the same things included like our coders in Dynabusters+!
The items can cause various effects:

Extra bomb (GreyBomb)
   Increase layable bombs.

Explosion range (YellowSun)
   Explosion spread increase.

Kickability (Hand)
   Ability to kick/throw bombs.

Molotov* (Bottle)
   All thrown bombs  are molotov cocktails.. Try it, but don't be nearby when
   it hits a wall or the ground (1 square spread)!

Speedup* (RollerSkate)
   Double your Bombaman's speed.

Flakjacket* (Jacket)
   Immunity from explosions.

Extend Coin (XCoin)
   Extend the time you have a temporary powerup.

Timeout Clock (Clock)
   End your current powerup.

Wild Star* (Asterisk)
   Global effect on all players.

Detonator (Plunger)
   Detonate all bombs on-screen.

Ghost Bombs* (SmallBlackBomb)
   Lay a bomb, it vanishes and reappears just before exploding. "Surprise!"
   Try kicking and throwing these!

Yinyang Effects* (YinYang)
   Random  selection  including: Short / Long  fuses, Mega / Mini Explosions,
   Speedup / Slowdown / Reverse, Immunity, Invisibility, Autolay, Nobombs


I'm very  sorry for  copying this  part out  of the  textfile  but  I'm under
pressure of time and it's much faster this way. The players can be controlled
using  normal joysticks, jagpads (like DB+!), printer  port joysticks and the
keyboard.

The registration fee is 5 POUND STERLING. Feel free to write to:

This game  is really worth  the price and everyone who like such games should
register. This  guy seem some  sort of multitalent 'coz everything is done by
himself and that should be appreciated!

In the textfile he announces more games if enough registrations are made. All
in  all it's  a nice  game and  it's  good to see that someone is still doing
something for the STE in 1998.

... don't blame me... I'm not good in testing games...
