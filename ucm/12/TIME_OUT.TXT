...the  people in  the scene  already waited  a long time  for the  first big
Falcon-demo by  the new Polish  dreamteam "MYSTIC BYTES" that  was founded by
former  members of  CONFUSIONS  and legendary  SHADOWS. But  now, the time of
waiting is over, or to say it in the words of Mystic Bytes, it's "TIME OUT"!

When Grey/MB  appeared at  German InterJam '98-party, it wasn't too sure that
he has a demo from his crew on one of his disks. But then he told me, more or
less as  a secret, that MYSTIC BYTES  are going to present a big demo for the
Falcon there and its name would be "TIME OUT". Hehe, you surely could imagine
what jokes I made  about this name. I told  Grey that the demo is called this
way 'cause  they had no  time to  design  the whole production  in the end or
because  it's the "timeout" for  the atARi-scene. ...one  fact made me really
anxious to see the  demo. I heard that A -t-/cream has  done the graphics for
it, and due to the fact A -t- did not tell me about his work for MB's demo, I
was quite confused about this.

Well, you  surely read some  lines about the  demo's presentation in an other
article of this mag, so let's go straight to the review of it.

TIME OUT has a size of 2.6 MB on harddisk and it comes with nine files or so.
It can  be started  from any  resolution, but  I realized you should start it
after having  booted your computer with CONTROL-key held down. Else there can
be some nasty graphics-errors.

In the beginning, the screen  is set to high resolution and an ascii-art logo
is shown, telling the name of the production. After pressing SPACE, there are
several information  like depacking of  music and  so on. The cracks of scene
might  call  this "initialisation time", but  due  the  fact  we  are  not  a
professional diskmag as some British are, we only call it "several info". ;)

Then the screen is set to black and a growling  music in a really strange but
nice style  can be listend  to. Timed to the  beat of  the music, a raytraced
logo saying "mystic bytes" is faded to the screen. It looks  quite nice, even
if it's raytraced. ;) The logo - as  all other  shown gfx - are  not shown in
the  same  color-palette, but  they fade  all the  time to darker or brighter
versions of the original palette. This looks nice and produces some tension.

Next  effect  is a  snake  tunnel, shown  in  lowres  using  cinemascope  and
doublescan. It is moving downwards all the time and uses colorful textures.
Very nice. Another  tunnel-texture-effect  that is  hard  to  describe. It is
accompanied by  the credits that  come in from the  left and the  right side.
Even nicer! Next, timed to  the hi-hat of the music, some kind of white stars
on black  background appear to the  screen, using lensflares. This  effect is
only two seconds shown, but it is just outstanding cool!
Very good presentation idea, Mystic Bytes!
This one is  followed by a colorful texturemapped vector which is bigger than
your screen. It moves upwards and then behind it we see another undescribable
tunnel-effect. Colorful, heavy white lights, lense-flares.
Fucking hard stuff.
It fades away and a raytraced TIME OUT logo appears on the screen. It's shown
in brown  color and the  O of "OUT" is a pocket-watch. It looks okay, but you
could do better with  pixel-graphics. And  another tunnel, again snake-style.
But this time the exit of the tunnel rotates in anti-clockwise direction.
Well  done. A  raytraced picture  by  agent -t- is  displayed, showing  a man
standing in his cold room, looking out of the window. Not bad for a raytrace-
picture. ;) (I  have to  admit that  the uninterrupted  fading  of the colors
sucks a bit at this point.)
The last effect is another tunnel, this time with a very  bright light at the
end of  the tunnel  that drives  away nearly the whole colorful textures. The
shown _unfortunately not variable_ lensflares  really kick butt! I never seen
such cool stuff on Falcon before. After that the weird techno-styled music is
over and the screen is black. TIME OUT is over.

Man, what can I say about this demo? It is just a truely outstanding piece of
art with a  very fine presentation and design. Yes, that's what I call I demo
and I don't like to hear the critizism of  some guys at InterJam, saying only
one  effect - a  tunnel - is  shown. Well, that  may be  true, but HOW Mystic
Bytes did that - they coded lensflares as first group on atARi - is just good
enough  to call TIME OUT one of the best demos for Falcon so far. Agent -t-'s
raytracing  graphics are  quite good (gosh, this is his job!!) and the design
is surprisingly excellent for a Polish production. (you know what I mean...)

I also  want to  send my best  wishes to Squard, who  finally stepped  in the
Olymp of  best atARi-coders. Hopefully  he won't get a  brainwash just as the
coder of the  old SHADOWS, who is on PC and AMiGA these days... Well, I doubt
that SQUARD reads this  some times, but hey, how about some variable (moving)
lensflares in the next demo? Keep on going, pal!
