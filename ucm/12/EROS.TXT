                        an interview with Eros / Cobra
                            by Grey / Mystic Bytes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grey    Hi Eros!

Eros    Hje Grey ! Nice to see ya :) So, what do u want from me...?


Grey    Well, your destination  finally  got ya! I am  gonna to  give ya some
        weird questions :))

Eros    Oki, but only  weird questions, I hope  you won't asking me questions
        about my private life or any immoral questions :))


Grey    First of all tell us something about yourself (how old are you and so
        on...)

Eros    Well, my real  name sounds - Lukasz Piotr Thomas Koplinski. I'm about
        20 years old... Hm, let me think...
        I was born on 10th of November 1978...so, I'm a Scorpion!!!
        ble, ble...
        Now I'm biology student, too.
        My blood is: red, hot (B Rh+)
        My hair are dark blond and now they're very short cutted
        Bed habits: idle & cigarettes
        What do I  like? RPG (Ad&d, KC, Warhammer, CyberPunk, etc.) football,
        cycling, SF &  Fantasy  stories  and novels, biology, astronomy, good
        parties, food, music & nice girls
        AnD Of CoUrSe - ATARI - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        ENOUGH???


Grey    How begun your history with Atari computers?

Eros    If my memory is good ... it was about  10 years  ago , when I touched
        an Atari Computer for the 1st time. Oh, sorry many years ago I'd seen
        Atari game consoles but it wasn't a very impresive experience :)
        So, in the late '80 many of my friends bought  8-bit Atari Computers,
        XE, XL series (64kB RAM, tape and so on). Mainly, we  played  on cool
        games  like: River Raid, Spy vs. Spy, etc. Atari was everywhere, so I
        said: 'I must get my own Atari' :)  But I  had to  wait  for my Atari
        until 1991. 1st I wanted to buy 130XE with tape, but one acquaintance
        showed me  the ST  series. I  felt in  love with ST :) and I bought a
        1040STfm with  mono monitor  very quickly, too  quickly. I was in the
        dark about STe series, there wasn't a difference for me: ST or STe :(
        NeXT stage was  1996. After  QuaST Party 4, I  bought Atari 65XE with
        floppy disk drive, I was so randy :)) by XE/XL demos.
        Now I want to buy F030 but... I don't know if there is a sense :(
        People  must  think  about  turbo  cards  for  Falcon with 040 or 060
        processors, not  only 030, 16MHz  today  this  configuration  is just
        funny.


Grey    What computers you do you own?

Eros    Now I have 4 computers:
        > Atari 1040 STfm
        > Atari 65 XE (0.5 MB RAM, stereo, etc.)
          soon, Macgyver hurry up with this!:)
        > C-LAB Falcon MK I - borrowed from Winio
        > Amiga 1230/50MHz  - borrowed from BFA (thanks!!!)


Grey    What do you think about ST scene?

Eros    Is there something  like ST scene? :)   Now, seriously. In Poland you
        can count  ppl from ST  scene on  fingers, there  are no more than 10
        active people :(( and there's  no hope  on  improvement. So, ST is as
        dead as the death  itself. Maybe somewhere in Europe the situation is
        better but... how long? However, I  think that ST is not so bad comp.
        and if someone  makes stuff for ST he's great!!! Did u hear that? Try
        to be great!


Grey    What's your favourite ST demo and why?

Eros    STe demo - of coz 'Braindamage' (nice  soundtrack, poor  effects  but
                   well designed)
        STfm     - there are 2 demos:
                   'Flip-O' - good chip msx, nice effects, well designed
                   'Synergy mega demo' - great Scavenger msx!!!
        But all  this  demos  are  very  old  and  I  hope  to  see  some new
        brainblasting ST demos...


Grey    Rumours say  that you are  busy working on your first multi-part demo
        for ST. Could  you tell  us something  more about  this project? What
        effects can we expect?

Eros    Wait a moment. I'll make a phone to Mayonez (our main ST coder)...
        ...sorry but he said: 'Shut up!!! Don't  say  anything! our demo will
        be a great surprise'
        so, I can't tell u about effects :(( just wait and you'll see...


Grey    You are  co-organizers  of the  recent  QuaST  party. Now  you have a
        chance to invite our readers!

Eros    Oh, big thanks! :) You are so good :))
        'ARe YOu  an  Atari  FaNAtiC??? yOu  MUST <oMe t0  tH!ž pArTy - QuaST
        Party'98!!!'
