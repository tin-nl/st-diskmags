                      "RELATIONSHIT" by DANCE OR DIE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Polydor 1997

After the death of the  Machinery Label it was only a  question of time up to
the  signing under  a major label  by those  german dark electro heroes. This
maxi single saw  the light in autumn last year and says only one thing: Dance
Or Die are back, heavier than expected...
On this maxi you will find five tracks with a playlenght of overall 25 mins:

o1. relationshit (original mix)
o2. relationshit (extended mix)
o3. relationshit (terranova mix part one)
o4. relationshit (terranova mix part two)
o5. relationshit (seperation mix)

At first, the song is a pure electro smasher, with stretched voices, fast and
hard rhythms, a bit technoing too and with a little touch of industrial...
It gives a real strange view of the relattion between man and woman, seems to
be some memory to bad experiences.
It will fill up the dance floors for sure. Very good are the first two mixes,
both  done by  Dance Or Die itself, but I  prefer the  second one, it's a bit
harder and faster (aahhh... deeper =)).
The  two Terranova  mixes are  more  trance like  with breaks  and much  more
instrumental, it's really soft but I don't like it very much. A special minus
point  for the very  small differences  between the two mixes has to be added
too... They're sounding too similar.
Nice again  is the last mix, made  by Guido le Fric (produced Oomph! and some
others). It's the heaviest track with many e-guitars and, tata, 3o3 sounds, a
very strange crossover of technoing beats and sounds and sawing guitars, kewl
stuff!
The album, "Dehumanizer" is  delayed  much more (will  perhaps be released in
autumn) will be filled with much more crackers like "Relationshit". Meanwhile
another single, "Teenagemakeup" was released, in the same style...
Ok, what I have  to say? Final words: The  song is a  real smash hit, without
any doubt it will  fill the dancefloors  of the clubs. 3 mixes  are very nice
but the Terranova-ones are totally  superfluous, at least for  me. The single
has a long  playtime and  for the dumping  price of 4,99 DM  it was extremely
inexpensive. Negative is that  there are no  bonus tracks included, just only
one song in different mixes. That makes the single a bit boring with the time
and after a while you will not play  it again... Anyway, if you like hard and
fast  electro music crossed over with a little  bit industrial you should get
this single, esp. because  it will took  a long time up to the street date of
the final album... this single is made to feed the hype...
