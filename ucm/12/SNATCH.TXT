Yep. I got a copy of this game  right on the INTERJAM'98 party and I was very
happy about it! Ok, I still  don't have a Falcon, but  I hope to got some new
machine in  the next time. Anyway  I was able to play this  game for a longer
time on THE MATCH's machine live at the party and was very surprised, because
this guy don't wanted to release it at first and I don't understand this.
Ok, it still seems to have some bugs, but a first and horrible bug was killed
right at the  party too and so a version is out  which runs without bit probs
now, and this is what the Falcon-users need!
I don't know if you know the game "HEXXAGON" from the PC. If I remember right
DODGER of THERAPY wrote a conversion of it, called "HEXXOGAN" for Falcon some
years ago but it was a two-player-game only and  contained a lot of bugs too.
I don't know if there was a new release after the vo.6 in 1996.
Anyway, the  aim of the  game is very  simple. You have  to play  against the
computer or a human opponent. So  you have playfield  with 49 places and very
different start-options. You play it in this  way: at first you have 2 stones
or more, just  like your  choice in  the options. You  can set  a stone right
beside your current stone and wow! You have now two  stones! But you can move
also while jumping over one field and so you still have only one stone.
If you now  match it to  jump besides  the enemie  stones all  stones of your
opponent which border on your stone will get  your colour! And so it goes on,
move by move up to the  playfield is  fullfilled with stones or if someone is
not able to move again. The player  who has the most  stones on the field has
won and perhaps he can match it to reach the highscore.
I think it's  very easy  to understand. I will  go over to  the technics. The
game is presented in svga resolution  only, even the intro. There you can see
some painted  and rendered pictures. The game  itself is  nice presented too,
the grafix looking good (all hand pixeled). Ok, they don't use the full Fo3o-
palette but so it's not overstyled. They're doing their job good enough.
You can hear nice trackermusix too and in the game also some cool samples are
included if you're moving on the playfield.
After the game is over  you got also  some statistics about all the moves you
made  meanwhile  the game  and as I  already said  perhaps you  can enter the
highscore which will be saved too.
The game itself is mouse controlled and very easy  to understand... And becoz
of the  many different  start-options you  can play  again and  again without
being bored  to fast. Therefore  the computer-opponent  seems not  to be very
clever  and alone  it can  be that you're  after some  hours are bored of his
sometimes very strange moves. I've lost not only one game meanwhile my tests.
But if you have  a friend or  so you can  play against  him and so the fun is
much more saved.
Conclusion: All in one it's a nice little (erm, just 1,5 MB...) game for your
            Falcon and the first usefull version of this kind on this machine
            I think. If you like strategic boardgame get  it now! Furthermore
            it's very nice to have  a game, which  isn't created in the style
            of the RESERVOIR GODS. Even if they're the most productive people
            on the  Falcon they  didn't matched  it for long time to create a
            game which fascinates you longer than for 5 minutes... just think
            about it... Anyway! Start to snatch! Bockwurst!
