                      an interview with MacGyver / Cobra
                            by Grey / Mystic Bytes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grey      Yo, Mac! =)

MacGyver  Hello Grey. Nice to see you again!


Grey      Are you ready to spend some minutes with answering silly questions?

MacGyver  If I am ready? Hmmm.... let's say I do :))


Grey      Now I will ask you about a thing which nobody cares too much ;))
          Please tell us your real name, age and so on...

MacGyver  My real name is  Marcin Dubicki, I'm 21 years old. I am 192 cm tall
          (it's about 75 inches, hehe), 92 kg  mass, I  have long  blond hair
          (yet..), I was a student of mathematic, but I broke studies.....


Grey      How begun your history with aTARi computers?

MacGyver  Grey, come on! Give me some vodka, stop asking! :))


Grey      But after an interview, okay? :))

MacGyver  yeah, cool! =))
          It begun in 1992 year  or so, when I  bought Atari 65 XE. I started
          with easy  things in Basic  language, later in 1994 year I tried my
          powers in Assembler.
          At the beginning of 1995 year I created with 2 mates 'Sharks team'.
          We did a few lame demos and after a half year our group died :((
          Some time  later I  went on my  first  copy party - QuaST'95. I met
          there a  lot of ppl  from the  Atari XL/XE demo scene and I saw the
          Falcon the first time.
          Later I met  Winio who had a Falcon. He  showed me some demos like:
          Enraged, Eko-System, Lost Blubb, Obnoxious etc.
          Some time later  together with my friends from 'Best Quality' group
          we decided  to create a new XL/XE demo-team called 'Cobra'. After a
          couple of months Winio and Eros joined us.
          In the 1997 year  on June I bought a Falcon and at the same time we
          decided create  the ST and Falcon  section. The official sign of it
          was our first 96ktro for the Falcon at QuaST'97.


Grey      What computers are you own?

MacGyver  Atari 65 XE, 1 MB RAM, MIDI, Stereo, Freezer
          PC 486DX4 120 MHz, 20 MB RAM, 540 MB HDD, VGA mono
          Atari Falcon 030, 4 MB RAM, 120 MB HDD, CD ROM *8 (IDE), TV Color


Grey      Have you been in other demo-group before Cobra?

MacGyver  At the begin it was 'Sharks team' (I.95 - VI.95), later 'Pentagram'
          (VIII.95 - IX.95), and (from IX.1995) it is a 'Cobra'.


Grey      Cobra is a wellknown 8-bit Atari group in Poland. What was the main
          reason why you decided  you to create a 16/32-bit section of Cobra?
          Have you decided to follow the suit of 'Shadows'? =))

MacGyver  The main  reason was the fact that some guys in 'Cobra' had already
          ST and Falcon  machines and  because  of this fact I decided that I
          bought a Falcon. So as you can see it wasn't dependent of Shadows.


Grey      Except "Cobra" some  other  polish  8-bit Atari  groups  decided to
          create a 32-bit  section, like  Shadows, Excellent  and Pandemonium
          (ex High Voltage). It's a great solution, isn't it?

MacGyver  A part of XL/XE guys bought Falcons because they had an Atari logo,
          it's  some kind  of sentiment. Last  time the  same  did Monsoft of
          Banklan. It's only sad that the Falcon isn't such developped as the
          Amiga is.


Grey      What 'Cobra' is actually working on?

MacGyver  Actually my  Falcon is broken.. Mayonez is still making new effects
          on the ST, Eros  gets in touch  with new people, Winio bought a PC,
          Chris isn't  working on  anything because he spend most of the time
          with  his wife.. It's hard  to say  anything  about  other  members
          because they live far away from us...


Grey      What do you think about a Falcon demo scene?

MacGyver  People are cool, but they have to change their mind. Now we have to
          think about Turbo-cards (with 040 or 060 chip). I ever laugh when I
          see  the  rules  in the  invitation  when  somebody  writes 'Falcon
          competition - 030 chip  and  16 Mhz'. Somebody who writes shit like
          this must be fucking crazy.


Grey      What's your favourite Falcon demo?

MacGyver  Dream Dimension (cool gfx) - only 3D effects are missed...
          Demolition (nice soundtrack)
          Sonolumineszenz - right effects, but it's possible to make them
          faster!
          Eko System - cool, a  lot of 3D  stuff, only  sad that they haven't
          any textures, only filled vectors.


Grey      Have you heard about new Atari clones like Phenix or Milan? What do
          you think  about them? Is  it possible  to  create  a demo-scene on
          Phenix for example?

MacGyver  It's shit - it isn't  compatible with a Falcon, DSP isn't included.
          I have a  proposal to  firms which make it - do better a good turbo
          card with 040 or 060 chips for the Falcon!


Grey      What's your favourite music-band?

MacGyver  I like: Jean Michel Jarre - nice music
                  Big Cyc - cool texts
                  Prodigy


Grey      ... and a film? I guess it should be 'MacGyver' ;))

MacGyver  All comedies where  I can see  the following  actors: Jerry Zucker,
          Leslie Nielsen, Mell  Brooks, Monty  Python, also "Star Wars", "Die
          Hard 1,2,3" and parodies of well known films.


Grey      okay, at the end  please show  us your opinion about the followings
          things:

MacGyver  Atari         - maybe it won't be too  orginal, but they   wouldn't
                          be even able to give the gold for free! marketing 0

          Falcon        - excellent machine, but with Atari marketing - SUX!

          Jaguar        - look above

          Amiga         - great demos!!!

          PC            - shit but with marketing! only advantage: nice demos

          demo-scene    - it depends of the platform:
                          Amiga (friendship: 50%, demos: 100%)
                          Atari ST/Falcon (friendship: 100%, demos: 20%)
                          Atari XL/XE (friendship: 100%, demos:95%)
                          C-64 (friendship: 75%, demos: 70%)
                          PC (friendship: 20%, demos: 90%)

          Orneta '97    - Orneta '96 & Opalenica '97 were better....

          Maggie        - nice shell, but included info are bullshit.
                          they're based on rumours not on the facts..

          Undercover =) - The level  of articles  is really  great! sometimes
                          they do some mistakes as well like unreadable fonts
                          in the last issue and they include some lame intros


Grey      okay, thanx for your answers! let's drink that vodka! =))
