Here it  comes, the ONLY demo  release for Atari  from the  VOLCANIC PARTY 4,
held on the last weekend in February in France.
Anyway it has  won the competition against PC and Amiga-stuff (not seen these
things... the quality seems  to be very shitty, if an Atari-screen has beated
them up!).
Ok, this is just an intro of  about 50 kb, not much, I know, but at least one
little piece of food for our machines.
It's some kind of a joke demo.
The first screens are filled up with some jokes about PC, especially Windooze
95 and you can see some error boxes accompanied  with several french sayings.
Don't know what and haven't the motivation to dig out my dictionary.
Anyway nothing  special, just a plain  green background (some kind of design,
eh?! =) and the wellknown boxes, also filled with french messages.
After several boxes and some seconds  of silence you see at first some little
animations, like an  burning IBM-logo and a turning Intel-logo and after this
a big flickering NON (no! for the english people, hehe) on the screen.
Now the real screen  starts. After  the logo  some Scavenger musix  starts to
play (with dididrums), a big  Atari-logo  scrolls from  down to the middle of
the screen. On top of the  screen you can see a Volcanic logo, turning around
a raster  bar and low down  there is swinging  simple  one-plane-logo, saying
"MARTO". All in one it looks very nostalgic... not the style of the 90ies!
After this some dots in  several sprite curves  appearing on the screen and a
flickering Typhoon-logo in very technical outfit you can see in the middle of
the  screen. Hum, also  nothing  special. Other parts  are looking  much more
boring and so there is a very small picture with some hands (looks real nice)
and  4 (huurrr....) dots  circling  around, you  have a  small greetings  and
credits-screen and last but not  least a screen  with very  simple flickering
geometric symbols in front of  background, flickering  like a stroboscope too
(something like an old style  techno-screen). After  this the music stops and
another  joke-screen appears. You can  see a naked  woman and a little sprite
(erm, it  seems to be  Bob or so from Bubble  Bobble) is  trying to  bite the
woman in the right tit... hum... that's all.
Ok, as you know is PTIF on from  the ex-SURVIVORS who  had produced some very
old styled screens  for ST too and so it isn't a big surprise that he has not
changed this style. Hopefully they  will work out  more design  sometimes and
try to code more interesting effects as again and again out dated stuff (just
check out the review of the SURVIVORS screens in  this UCM! Ok, with the help
of STsurvivor from LOud! and Artek some nice pictures  are included this time
and this gives some bonus points (esp. the  first one seems  to be one of the
most skilled painters on ST today), but all in one the whole things suffers a
bit under the un-originality of the  effects and even if  the Scavenger-tunes
are really nice  it's time to use sounds from other people  because it can be
that we now have something like a  Scavy-overkill after  the Mad Max overkill
in the late eighties and early  nineties. Anyway the screen is ok and if they
can include a bit more design  it's possible for them to reach the front line
of the leading ST teams today.

last words: Sorry, but some  old effects and  small jokes about windows don't
            impress me in the way I like it...
