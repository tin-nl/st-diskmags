                                GOD BOY CORNER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first I had  thought that we  will never see  games for this  great Gameboy-
emulation for the Falcon, because of the rumours about the reaction of NINTENDO
and their request to stop all the God Boy stuff to the RESERVOIR GODS.
But new games  appeared and I wonder why and today I think more that  the whole
Nintendo-thing  was only  a strange but  cool promotion-gag  for  the  God Boy,
produced by the RESERVOIR GODS  self, if not, please  get in  touch with me and
tell me the truth, my Email add should be somewhere in this magazine.
Anyway I will take a short look to the latest God Boy releases for you...

done by : RESERVOIR GODS / UK
genre   : jump'n'run
system  : Falcon only of course, RGB & VGA, Nemesis support (!), Joypad support

This is the fourth GOD BOY release and again we have a typical japanese jump'n'
run here on  the Falcon. You know these strange comic-stuff like all those dumb
tv-series. In this game  you can chose one  of four different  enemies to fight
against  by your  own in  a fantastic  world. These  four baddies  are Elecman,
Fireman, Cutman and  Iceman and everyone  rules in a special styled world. It's
all the same, everytime and everywhere... you have to  run around, kill tons of
monsters and you have to jump and  climb around in  strange world, collect some
items and weapons... that's all...
The game features again the trainer-option and also the possibility to save the
game at any point. It's the biggest  GOD BOY game so far with  over 1 MB... you
have  the usual new  sound-track  via DSP, masses  of sampled  FX and the known
grafix in 8 colours... But this game is on  a not accelerated  Falcon very slow
and you will stop to play it after some minutes because it makes no fun...
Sorry, this  is my  personal view, it's  nice that  the Nemesis-board  will  be
supported, but who has such a thing?!
But another good point  is that you  can quit the  game without any problems to
come back to the desk... But for  me is one  point save... SUPER MARIO LAND was
the best GOD BOY game so far... Let us wait for the next releases...
