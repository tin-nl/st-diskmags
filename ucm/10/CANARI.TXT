                   "alright ma'" I replied and walked away.

Name     : Canari
Group    : MJJ productions
           3rd demo of that group on Falcon
successes: 1st place on Place 2 be V party
size     : 725 kB, ATOMIC-packed


After one  year silence, French  scene-pioneers "MJJ Productions" (which  means
AFAIK "Michal Jackson and  John Productions" -studpid  name, eh?!) released the
successor of their '96 production "Bound 42" at Place to be Party IV.
But, is it better than their smash demo from '94 called "Mostly Harmless"? Keep
on reading and you will get an answer....To be honest, my expectations were not
that  high after  their last  year's demo. I thought  that MJJ did  their final
demo, with  only one or two  members of the old  crew left, and that it will be
the end of MJJ. Today I have to admit that I was damn wrong.

The ~750 kB sized demo starts with a small orange MJJ-logo in the middle of the
screen. It  is in 16 colors  and I guess  I've seen  it before in  some old MJJ
releases. At  the top of  the two "J" appear  some more  or less  light-shining
effects, but in the age of lensflares, those look a bit poor. After only two or
three seconds four faces  of Joker/MJJ are shown, all in orange color. There is
a  bumpmap-effect on  these faces. Looks  nice, especially  because it  is only
shown for  a short  time. The  next effect  are some  objects, let's  call them
"suns", moving  into a  maybe 160x100 pixel  box in  the middle  of the screen,
joining together  and tearing apart again. This is really good. (I haven't seen
good  non-doublescan-FX for  a long time) A fine  looking 384x240 plasma-effect
that I  really cannot  describe (even  in German words  it would  be hard ;) is
followed by a textured cube. This cube is in  orange color, showing the face of
Joker on  all sides. The amazing  thing about it is the bumpmapping on it. Fine
effect, even  if there should  have been  some other  colors than  black in the
background. Next  effect are some  truely nice  interferences, again shown in a
160x100 box. Okay. The  last effect  of the demo  is a big  grey photo of Joker
which is distorted  in some strange ways. Then  its time to say good bye with a
scrolltext, a huge ball in the back on which a "MJJ productions"-logo is mapped
on, and a bumpmapper on the scroller and the ball. Looks fine.

The whole  demo goes  hand in  hand with  a fast  techno-tune  by Zigo/EXA. The
replay rout sounds a bit rough and the key-click isn't enabled.

Result: "Canari" is a good demo. I really like the fast changes of the effects,
        the demo is held in nearly the same color: orange. The best effects are
        IMHO the "sun"-effect and the interferences. It isn't very stylish like
        Avena-productions, but we  shouldn't forget, Joker  has done  the whole
        demo without any help from graphicians. So I like to tell my respect to
        Joker. (Maybe he  will never  read that (are the froggies from southern
        France reading this mag?!) If you will, I would like to get a mail from
        you, Joker! jur96mct@studerv.uni-leipzig.de)


        code: not a lot of new effects, but everything done nice and fast
              75%

         gfx: nearly no graphics  in this demo. Joker's face  is used a bit too
              often, so you might think MJJ is a crew of egocenticians. ;)
              40%

         msx: sounds too rough
              65%

      design: the demo is  fast, the effects  are only shown  for a short time,
              whole demo used the same  color, you won't get  bored; maybe some
              "crossings" between the effects are needed.
              70%


     allover: a MJJ  demo, not  as good  as "Mostly  Harmless", but  still good
              enough to call it the best French  production  since a long time.
              special bonus for making the demo alone.
              70%
