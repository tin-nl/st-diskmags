Q - Hi ST Survivor! I think it's time to make also an interview with you and so
    let us  start with  some informations  about yourself. How old are  you and
    what are  you doing  in your real life when you're  not sitting in front of
    your computer?

A - Hi everibody ! Hum, I'm 23 and I'm supposed to be - soon ? - a really great
    English teacher 8-) But this national exam is  so fucking hard that nothing
    is sure about  my destiny 8-( I spend  most of my time having... FUN either
    with my STe (love ya till the end !), my Playstation or listening to louuud
    music, some call it Death Metal and Trash, wonder why... Oh I  have friends
    too 8-)

Q - When you got in touch  with computers and what was your first machine? What
    is your current equipment?

A - Well my first  computer was an Apple 2C. It's still  here... sleeping in my
    attic. I used it to play games and code some programs but last time I tried
    to read one I just couldn't understand a single instruction. I also have an
    old SABA console (remember Pong ?). Of course my last and favourite machine
    is my 520 STe (upgraded to 4Mb) with a printer, external drive... the usual
    stuff you know.

Q - I'd like to know a little bit  about your background  in the scene. How did
    you get  into  the demoscene? Is NO LIMIT CODING  the first band you were a
    member of?

A - Well yes NLC (really stupid name btw) is my first band. Actually it took me
    long years to find out that the ones who made the ST live were these freaks
    called  demomakers. Finally, after  watching  the great Teckno Drugs demo I
    tried to get my chance contacting Thyrex and here I am ! I deeply regret my
    interest and involvment in the ST scene came so late. By 1992 the Scene was
    already dying, sigh ! Before joigning  NLC I belonged to an  ST association
    named CONTACT'ST (hi dudes !) which was  closely working  with the band The
    Cybernetics at that time.

Q - Can you tell me why you have chosen ST-SURVIVOR as pseudonym?

A - Quite simply... In 1992  already the  number  of ST freaks  was dangerously
    decreasing, so you could already been considered as a Survivor and  there's
    no way I'll give up my ST ! Even today I don't think about buying a Falcon,
    an Apple and surely not a PC ! Sometimes I wonder if I'm not an extremist !
    Anyway my motto remains : INTEL OUTSIDE.

Q - What's your  job in your  band and what  was the first  production you have
    taken part in?

A - My job in  the  band  consist(ed) in  gathering all  the suff, articles and
    previews among others, for the ToXiC Mag. Frankly our  diskmag was having a
    crappy time and I  believe I  came  when  someone like  me was  needed. I'm
    really proud of the  increasing number  of people involved in  the mag now,
    even though we're still having lots of problems. Oh btw I'm also a graphist
    but so far only a few  pictures by me can be found in old ToXiC MaG intros,
    St Collection 10 and  A l'aube du Matin  Du Soir 2. Let's hope  our Back In
    France will show you I'm not so bad an artist 8-)

Q - Can you  tell me something  about NO LIMIT CODING  itself? How many members
    are left and what are they doing? Are any new productions in  the pipeline?
    What about future plans?

A - Erm delicate stuff... Actually NLC's been deeply inactive for years ! After
    their Tekno Drugs a sequel (Virtual Teckno) was seriously planned and I was
    responsible for the gfx. I had a lot  of ideas though I  lacked experience.
    Anyway this project never went further than being a nice dream... Strangely
    NLC welcomed new members shortly after. What for ?? Then they all gradually
    lost interest  in the scene or  moved to the PC (mostly for  their studies)
    and so quickly only Thyrex (code), BB Fuck (music) and  me remained active.
    Thyrex and I have been working on a gfa  megademo called Back In France but
    once again we - mainly Thyrex should I say - lacked  motivation... So far I
    don't know for sure whether this  demo will be released or not. but I won't
    let it die in a hard drive !

Q - You're one of the little ToXiC Mag team and as it seems you've big problems
    to release the issues in a regular way. Can you tell us why?

A - Yes you can say that we have problems with  the mag... Only ONE problem but
    it's messing  up with the whole  thing I'm  afraid. Actually when  you read
    these lines, you  can be sure  that about  60 articles are  already ok. But
    Thyrex doesn't care anymore and so it often takes him weeks (or  months) to
    code the mag. It's really stupid, some much work wasted like this.

Q - As the most people should know, the ToXiC Mag  is mainly a french magazine,
    why you have chosen your mothertongue? Ok, it's surely easier to write some
    articles, but the spreading isn't the best because of this... Are there any
    changes planned?

A - When I first came to business with the mag it was already limited to French
    readers and I must say that I  didn't see  anything wrong with it. But when
    the scene started to  shrink we didn't react and  now it's far too late. Of
    course I'd like to bring  you a nice English issue of the mag  but you know
    how bad French are when it comes to write/speak English !! I can't spend my
    spare time translating  40 articles or  more... Today, as the  spreading is
    limited we also offer people an HTLM version of the diskmag (all issues are
    available) so that even  Mac or PC (beurk)  owners can read it. It's easier
    than having an  international version of the mag. Besides  we don't want to
    compete with the UCM 8-)

Q - Another  question to  another project... you  surely know  what I mean: the
    BACK IN FRANCE GFA demo from your team. Will it see the light sometimes?
    Are other bands invited in this demo-project or is it only a NLC-production
    (up to now =) ...)

A - First I must set one thing : this demo is very old ! The project started in
    1994 and back  then Arsenic, Atrocity and someone else (Sector One ? I have
    forgotten) were to participate. But nothing came from  them because most of
    them simply left the St scene. Thyrex  then lost motivation. But he went on
    improving his code and I can tell you that now it's  really great ! Between
    you and me we only  have to fix some bugs (the  main loader is tricky), add
    my piccies and change some texts and that's it ! But Thyrex is lazy.

    Personnally I would rather release it "as-is" than never. So you can expect
    it before the end of the  year. I have a preview  version I could spread on
    my own if Thyrex doesn't move his ass.

Q - Up to now your band was only a ST-group. Do you thinking  about changing to
    the Falcon or open a Falcon-section? Please tell me why if yes or not...

A - Our Virtual Teckno project WAS to be  released on Falcon but... Don't think
    about NLC as an active band. Most of the members have vanished for years. I
    just hope  I'll convince  Thyrex to complete  our demo. To  me it's  really
    important. Maybe I'll leave NLC then and find another band to work with...

Q - What do you think about the ATARI-scene in general? And what about esp. the
    french scene? It seems as there is nearly no contact  between the french ST
    and Falcon-freax...

A - Well I must confess that I was highly  disappointed by the Falcon. It's not
    so powerful and could not replace the ST. I  really have NO interest in the
    Falcon scene : I still have some old contacts there and I like watching the
    new prods but that's all. Btw the Soluminescenz stuff is really stunning !!

Q - I have the impression as the whole french scene  is still here but not very
    interested in giving info to foreign  countries... It  is very difficult to
    get informations from France. Do you have any idea why?

A - Don't know. It's always difficult to know who's active and who's not 8-(( I
    really hate the news  that include the  dead crews. I mean we are survivors
    and it's hard to go on, so why  should we  mention again and  again the old
    crews ? Instead of  losing  time like  this  we  should (esp French  bands)
    concentrate on ourselves by meeting more  often for example. The reason for
    our absence on the  International Scene may be due to our "general" lack of
    interest in  the other countries, esp when you have to speak/write English.
    And very few of us have access to the INet... still too expensive.

Q - Many guys are  thinking that  with the PaCifiST  emulator a resurrection of
    the almost dead ST-scene is possible. What do you think about it?

A - I'd like to see PaCifiST running on my father's PC so that I could say that
    for once this computer can prove useful !! I don't think this emulator will
    bring back the old  scene but  maybe we'll have nice surprises. Future will
    tell us if I'm right or wrong.

Q - Will you put  your ST in the corner  sometimes and put a PC on your desk or
    will you quit (scene)-computing instead joining the dark side?

A - Maybe one day I'll spend less time with my STe and  more time running after
    girls or having a job, being someone serious you know 8-) but it may come a
    little later I think. About having a PC. Yes maybe one day I'll WORK  using
    a PC but it'll never be the same. My STe is not  only a machine to me, it's
    a kind of dream, a means to meet cool people and make loads of friends.

    About joining a PC band, erm... NO WAY ! Until my  brain melts I  don't see
    why I should do such a stupid thing 8-)

Q - What do you think about the latest ATARI-clones called PHENIX and so one?

A - You know I'm still living in  the past, so  please don't  tell me about the
    future, I could get traumatized ! I only hope this machine can bring a real
    alternative to PCs

Q - Ok, what about a little bit brainstorming?! I will give you some words and
    you can give me your  opinion with a single  word or paragraph... You will
    surely wonder about some strange words =) but... it doesn't matter...

    ATARI           - Thanks for the ST men ! But... Burn in Hell now !
    BEER            - Yes I know I shouldn't drink so much ! Kro rules !
    CRACKING        - Erm don't really like crackers...
    DEMOS           - A wonderful realm were all dreams meet.
    "ELITE"         - No comment.
    FALCON          - Could have been really blasting but failed.
    GIGAFUN'97      - Last edition was so lame !! Didn't move this time.
    HUMAN RACE      - Still wonder if we deserve life or horrible death.

    YAOURT =)       - My favourite is with Banana or Cherries.
    Z-BUFFER ON ST? - And ZADFE-Buffer on my Fridge ???

Q - Hum, I think this is enough. Other themes. What do you  think about the UCM
    and have you any suggestions?

A - Well frankly it's always a great thing to read  a new issue of the UCM. You
    MUST go on with it pal ! Suggestion ? Erm can you help me to read German ??
    I wish I  could have  read Llama's interview 8-( Another  thing is that you
    should try to put some goddies on your disk because it's really hard to get
    news and well you know it  would be like a Kinder sweet : first there's the
    chocolate and then the surprise inside the egg 8-)

Q - What about some personal words or messages to our readers?

A - Come on people the St won't die as long as  there's still someone who cares
    about it. We're  still here and  we need volunteers ! Anyone of  you can do
    something : code, paint, swap, compose music, write and so on unless you've
    been brainwashed by a PC 8-)
