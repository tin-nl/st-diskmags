Q - Hi Raster! I think it's  time to make  an interview  with you and so let us
    start with some  informations about  yourself (even if I  already know them
    because of our contact). How old are you and what are you doing in the real 
    life when you're not sitting in front of your computer?

A - Hi Moondog! I'm 17 years  old and  I live  in Szczytno (small  town  in the  
    north-west  Poland). I'm  going to the secondary school. In the free time I 
    like to go out with my friends, watch tv, listen music or go sleep...
 
Q - When you got  in touch with computers and what was your first machine? What 
    is your current equipment?

A - My adventure with computers had began about 8 years ago - it  was my uncles 
    XE. I've got my first machine about 5-6 years ago (in X-mas) - it was STfm. 
    I bought it from my uncle  and he bought  Amiga. About 1 year ago I changed 
    from STfm  to STe which I bought from Spiryt. So, now I've got STe with 4MB 
    Ram.
    
Q - I'd like to  know a little bit  about your background in the scene. How did
    you get into the demoscene?

A - It started about 2 or 3 years ago, when I found my first group with  2  old 
    friends from  my own city. It  was a really  lame group, yeah. We had a GFA 
    coder and two 'very good' graphicians. In September 1995 when my great crew 
    died I wrote  to Yahoo (now  his name  is Spiryt) and  we found  Confusions 
    common with MrGod. Our next member was Maskotka and that how it's started.

Q - What's your  job in your band CONFUSIONS? What was the first production you 
    have taken part in?

A - I'm a graphician  and also  musician. The first production with  my picture 
    was Confusions intro (without name) which  had been  released at the Orneta 
    party '96.

Q - Can you tell me  something about the  CONFUSIONS  itself? How many members,
    what are they doing, any new productions in the pipeline, future plans?

A - Confusions members are:

    Sqward - main coder
    Vulgar - graphician
    Martin - swapper
    Maskotka - gfa
    Seabrush - musician
    Immortal - graphician, musician and gfa 
    Toovey - musician      
    and me...  

    I'm not sure, but maybe  this list will change because few guys are fucking   
    lazy (they  don't even answer  for my letters) and  we want to do something 
    with this problem... 
    Future plans... I don't  know anything for a moment but I think we will try 
    to release a new demo, this time for the Falcon.

Q - Why is your Orneta Demo  called "Amok" still unreleased?! I think the scene
    needs the release to get new motivation... Some words about this?

A - Uhh... the  only  explain I  have is  that our coder  was searching for the
    relocator to finish the demo. Now it's finished and I hope you like it. And 
    believe me - I was waiting for it too!
    
Q - Up to now  your band was only a ST-group. Do you thinking about changing to 
    the Falcon or open a Falcon-section? Please tell me why if yes or not...

A - Cnf is changing  to Falcon, because  Sqward had  won a Falcon at Orneta '97 
    and he sold his ST. Also Martin has Falcon now and Vulgar probably will buy 
    it too. So now I think you will see something on the 030 from us.
    
Q - What do you think about the ATARI-scene in general? After the very bad last 
    year  today it seems  that the scene  will survive a bit longer as the most 
    guys (including myself) have thought.

A - It's a hard question but I think that the Atari scene is dying slowly.  The 
    main  reason (for me) is  that  Atarians are fucking  lazy. There are  only a 
    few productive groups which want really to do something. I don't  know what  
    the rest  of scene  is thinking? Will  the scene grow without demos? When I 
    look on  the Atari scene, I'm  not astonished that some groups are changing 
    to the PC.
         
Q - Many guys are thinking  that with the  PaCifiST  emulator a resurrection of 
    the almost dead ST-scene is possible. What do you think about it?

A - I don't really know, but I think it can be a sollution.

Q - Will you put your ST in  the corner sometimes  and put a PC on your desk or
    will you quit (scene)-computing instead joining the bad side?

A - PC on my own desk? Hmm, my desk is too  small... But if  I change my system 
    it would be probably an A1200, because of their great scene and demos.

Q - What do you think about the latest ATARI-clones called PHENIX and so one?

A - I read something  about Phenix in Maggie and it looks very promising, but I  
    want to see  something on it first. I don't think that it would be a future 
    of the Atari scene because of the prize. But maybe I'm in mistake.

Q - Ok, what about a little bit  brainstorming?! I will give you some words and
    you can give me your opinion with a single word or paragraph...

    ATARI          - a part of my life
    CRACKING       - something what we need to get free games...
    DEMOS          - something what Atari scene need
    "ELITE"        - my favourite cracking band?
    FILLER =)      - just wait for issue #3
    INTERNET       - great thing
    JAGUAR         - my favourite wild animal
    "LAMER"        - he did filler #2...
    MICROSOFT      - why do you ask me about it, what I did...?
    NINTENDO 64    - power^fun!
    POLAND         - criminality is growing up!
    QUAST PARTY 97 - my best party!  
    SCENE          - rulez!
    UNDERCOVER =)  - best Atari zine!

Q - Hum, I think this is enough. Other themes. What  do you think about the UCM
    and have you any suggestions?

A - I think that we need more magazines like UCM. Suggestions? Just do the next 
    issues as best as you can.

Q - Your group is making also a magazine, called Filler. Can you tell us if you
    are planning more issues, perhaps in english?

A - Yes, we planing to release issue #3 soon. All shell will be change, because
    issues #1 and #2 were damaged by Maskotka. There will be also english text.

Q - Ok, I will not bore you and also the readers with more senseless  questions
    and if you want to tell something to our readers, you can do it now...

A - I want to send greetz to all Atari guys I know and I hope to see real Atari
    scene someday. 
    
Q - Ok, that's all for today and I wish all the best for you and your band!
    Thanks a lot for spending us some minutes of your time, bye
