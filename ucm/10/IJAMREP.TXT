
                           I'm so tired  of myself
                And so tired of everything  and everyone else
                                I can't think
                                I can't sleep
                        When you come it goes so deep
                     Don't make promises  you can't keep

                                  Stroke me
                                  Caress me
                 Make love instead of fire burn and bless me

                           I'm so tired in my soul
                           And I can't  conceal it
                        There's a warmth in your eyes
                            And I need to feel it
                          There's a  cure somewhere
                           And you can  reveal it.

The  party started on  friday the  3rd of October  and ended  on sunday the 5th
October. We (that  means me and Dynacore) arrived at the party at 13 o'clock on
friday. In the left  side of the  entrance they placed the realtime-article and
on the right side there was a PC where you could enter your name, group, e-mail
and so  on. This was also the place to pay the entrance-fee which was 30 german
marks.

Allright  fine. When I entered  the hall it  was still a bit empty. On the left
side I saw Llama/.tSCc. and Sage/Escape and said 'Hello!'. The rest of the hall
was filled with C64 and PC guys at that time.
Later on some guys from Checkpoint, Escape, tnb, Animal mine, Therapy  and also
some swiss  guys arrived at the party. All in all there were about 90 people on
the party and the hall was nearly full... but there were mostly PC machines. :(

Rumours  came up  about  releases  of .tSCc., Escape and tnb but .tSCc. was the
only group who finished their 4k and gave it to the organizers. Due to the fact
that it was the only entry Llama decided not to show and not to release the 4k-
tro which included enviroment-mapping on a simple STF!

Competition  time came up. At first they played the modules and I have to admit
that  most of the  entries were  of high quality. Nine modules in total. Second
compo was the C64-music competition which was a bit dissapointing. There were 6
entries. Third was grafix-compo with 6 entries. Right after  this came the C64-
gfx-competition with 6 really good entries.
Then came  to PC-64k-tro comp with 4 shitty intros except one. At last came the
PC demo-compo with one great Sci-Fi-Demo and one funny fake demo.

After some  hours the  results were published. Look  for them elsewhere in this
magazine. Some  people doesn't seemed to be so satisfied with their prices (Die
64er Leute mit dem C16 als Preis haben sich bestimmt verarscht gefÅhlt. Das Ihr
die Flaschen  Wein, die Ihr ja sowieso UMSONST vom Pizza-Service gekriegt habt,
als Preise genommen habt, war doch wohl ein schlechter Witz, Hagen? ...
Un auûerdÑmm hÑÑst des MC Laser... sprich ééHM.SII.LÑyser un nit MAC! Ja simmer
do in Schoddland odder waaas?)

The party  was finished on  Sunday the 5th of October at 14 o'clock. All in all
it  wasn't  so bad  but  I personally  prefered  the  InterCon  last  year. The
atmosphere was a bit better because more atarians attended this party.
This year  we had the problem that the ATARI FAIR in Neuss was at the same date
and so the rest of the scene was splitted up. What a shame.
Mr. Coke of Absence/Icebird officially said that the SILICONVENTION 98 will NOT
happen (but '99)! Due to this  sad fact the  INTERJAM '98 (or whatever  it will
be called  next year) will be the only party for atarians which will take place
here in  germany. Let's hope that the presence of the atari-scene will increase
next year.
