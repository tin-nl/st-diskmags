                              "NORTHERN LIGHTS"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released 1996 by I.N.R.I. Records

Finally I've got it, the  last piece of music  made by SILKE BISCHOFF which was
not in my collection.
This is their latest album, released in 1996, together with the "WASTE OF TIME"
EP (do you remember my review in an older issue of the UCM?).
Ok, at first I will tell you, as always, the...

...contents

01. Intro
02. Waste Of Time
03. Northern Lights
04. Sometimes
05. The Letter '96
06. Silent War
07. In Your Dreams
08. Blue Moon
09. Blue Eyes
10. Waste Of Time (club mix)
11. Waste Of Time (acoustic)

You have  surely noticed  that  this album doesn't contain  too much  stuff. At
first  there is a  re-release  of a  song: "The Letter" which was  first on the
album "TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE" (1995). And  than, for  me a bit  disappointing
there are three versions  of "Waste Of Time" included and so  this album leaves
a  split impression  in my mind. At the one it looks  as the band had a lack of
new  songs at the  release-date of  this new piece  and at  the other hand this
can't be, because on  the EP you can find other new songs. Also the play-lenght
of only 43 mins is  a bit disappointing  to me, because the last two album were
both over a hour. Hum, don't know.
Another fact  is that  they have  much more  developped  their sound, even if I
think  that "TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE" is  their best  album so far. Their songs
have lost again the open brutality as known especially from the first one.
Therefore the  still existing violence is a bit more in  the background and you
must see the lyrics from different views to discover it.
Also  the sound is a bit softer  as in former times, a little bit  more pop and
many acoustic-guitar-stuff. But for me  this album is not as interesting as the
other ones... I miss  some special  earworms (does this word exist in english?)
as on the  older ones. The only really good songs (in sound and lyrics) are for
me "Waste Of Time", "Northern Lights" and "Sometimes". BTW the last one is also
a piece of music which could please also some Depeche-Mode-fans... it remembers
a bit to the old stuff from the beginning eighties.
But to  come to a conclusion: it's  not a bad album, no question, but for me it
was  a bit disappointing, the songs aren't  bad and in the usual quality, but I
miss  some highlights. So we must wait  what the next album  brings. Don't know
when it will be released, hopefully  soon, because the  music of SILKE BISCHOFF
is something like  a lifestyle for me and sometimes  it's a bit of a reflection
of my own feeling and my thoughts...

_WASTE OF TIME_

I wanna know
I wanna know if you're the one
The only moon behind the sun
We will walk into the light
When I close my eyes

I wanna know
I wanna know if you're the one
To lead me through the darkest night
We will walk into the light
When I close my eyes

I'm here on my own again
Dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you
So please leave me now
Please leave me now
All in all it's just a waste of time
So please leave me now
Please leave me now
All in all it's just a waste of time

_NORTHERN LIGHTS_

I can't remember
What happened last night
Your angry voice
In a blue blue light
I was too drunken to find the right words
Now it hurts
I spent the rest of the night on the floor
I open my eyes
There's blood on the wall
I can't believe it
This can't be true
Where are you?

I'm here on my own
In the northern lights
I'm here on my own
In the northern lights

Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes it's hard
To play all these games
With a broken heart
And sometimes there's no way to run away
So why don't you stay?
Show me your body
And open your mind
There's no time to lose
Because we can find
The key for the gates of eternity
Can't you see?

_SOMETIMES_

Burning clouds in the sky
I count the hours passing by
I see your face
But what's behind?
Mysteries - what will I find?
Is there a tear behind your smile?
Is there a truth behind your lies?

Oh sometimes - oh sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside
Oh sometimes - oh sometimes
Only the broken heart decides

Burning stars in the sky
Is it because or is it why?
I count all the tears I've cried
A broken mirror on the wall
Is this an answer or a call
I see your face but what's behind?

_THE LETTER_

I'm writing a letter
A letter for you
For the last time
Love me true
Shouldn't we better
Stay on our own
Shouldn't we better stay alone

I'm writing a letter
A letter to you
It's not easy
I'm leaving you
You can remember me
When you hear this song
You can remember me
When I'm gone

I'm writing a letter
A letter for you
For the last time
Love me true
Shouldn't we better
Stay on our own
Shouldn't we better stay alone

I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of you

_SILENT WAR_

Another rainy day
In this silent war
I think it's too late
Crying like a child
'Cause we've gone too far

Another rainy night
In this silent war
I think it's too late
Crying like a child
'Cause we've gone too far

We're in a silent war
We've gone too far
We're in a silent war
We've gone too far

_IN YOUR DREAMS_

You're looking so helpless
Laying on the floor
We're all damned
Never clean enough
To walk through the door
It seems to be so senseless
To stay in the past
We're all lost
Never close enough
Always too fast

In your dreams
It's easy to fly
In your dreams
In a blue blue sky
In your dreams
It's easy to fall
In your dreams
You hear me calling your name

I've acted so mindless
I run through the night
Broken heads
Never clean enough
To follow the light
Your face looks so empty
You're laying on the floor
You're gone
Never strong enough
To walk through the door

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_BLUE MOON_

I remember the waves that come and go
I can smell the sea
I can taste the sky
The dream lives for the dream itself
And I talk to the moon
Blue moon

I should have better stayed at home
I wish I would be all alone
Disconnected for some years
All those tears
I should have better stayed at home
I wish I would be all alone
Disconnected for some years
All those tears

Remember the years
I didn't really miss you
Remember the tears
I can hear your voice
I can see your face
Remember the years
I didn't really miss you
Remember the tears
Hello and goodbye

_BLUE EYES_

The moon is hidden behind a cloud
The rain is falling down in silence
Can you hear my voice?
There's a shadow in the dark
I can't move
I can't break the silence
I can drink your breath

In your eyes
In your blue eyes
I can see myself looking into your eyes

I'm diving in a liquid sky
In the colour of your eyes
In silence
I can drink your blood!
Your face is hidden behind your hairs
A sweet dream
But I don't care
I'm falling
Can you hear my voice?

In your eyes
In your blue eyes
I can see myself looking into your eyes
