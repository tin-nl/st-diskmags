PROBLEMS...

Short message from me, Moondog.

As you have noticed, the  whole software-corner  is a bit small  this time. The
reasons are  simple. My Falcon  fucked up and  I got not all the other stuff to
test and I don't  wanted to drive around  with my car to search for people with
running machines. But  be sure, we will make up for the next  time. So you will
find the reviews of the last  Shadows-demo, the final Amok-demo (it doesn't run
on 1 MB, even in version 1.0) and other stuff like "Alien Blast" in UCM 11!
It's hard to understand because some of the writers still own a Falcon but they
don't want to test the stuff for me. Don't know why. So the corners will filled
up when my Falcon is repaired. So long... Moondog / poets of decay
