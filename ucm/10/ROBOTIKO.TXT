                      Do droids dream of electro music?
                      ---------------------------------

If you like Kraftwerk and similar music you are on the right place here. Due to 
the success of 'Sonic Empire' by the members of mayday, electro is more popular 
again. (and  to point  it  out... I MEAN  NOT  EBM!). Most  people  think  that 
'electro' is  some 'new' kind of techno-style but that's absolutely wrong! So I 
try to educate you.

Back in  the late 70's and  early 80's a  group called 'KRAFTWERK' has released 
some  albums that  influenced the  whole music scene. When 'Computerworld' came 
out in 1981 it started a movement in electronic music. In 1982 Afrika Bambaataa 
used  the melody  from 'Trans  Europe  Express' to  create 'Planet  Rock' which 
became one of the biggest 'Hits' in the Hip Hop scene. That's how it was ... 
HIP HOP. It was street music and everybody was doing breakdance to those beats.
Different styles were created out of this roots.

Electrofunk       - electro beats and sounds with funk vocals

Electro Hip Hop   - electro beats and sounds with rap and vocoder voices

Electro           - instrumental electro sounds with vocoder voices

Freestyle         - electro beats with vocals (e.g. Johnny O)

Miami Bass        - fast electro beats, subsonic basses, rap with party rhymes

Techno Bass       - instrumental electro sounds with vocoder voices but 
(Detroit)           more technoid than normal electro
 

Breakdance and electro was forgotten during the years but it never disappeared.
The real  Hip Hop scene  live in  tradition of the  OLD SCHOOL and  so electro
developed  since the  past. In 1995  the 'Techno-scene' discovered  electro for 
themselves and played the old records like Cybotron's 'CLEAR' in their sets and 
that's  why electro became  so big nowadays. Here are a few Trax you should not 
miss...
