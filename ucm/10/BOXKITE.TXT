                  ------------------------------------------

Heyho and yo to  another little article  for the great UCM zine. This time I've
decided to take a look at a little tool which goes in competition with the well
known SELECTR!C.
I think the  most of  you knew  this kind  of utilities. Both  are  alternative
selector-boxes to  replace the old and  boring TOS-selector and bringing a load
of new features to your desktop.
B0XKiTE is also shareware (as SELECTR!C) and  will cost 2o DM for  registering,
if you don't have the free  version made by the  allmighty VEX... ;) but by the
way, this little tool  is really worth the  money and if you'll use it take all
your courage and pay the registering price (if you have left some Deutsch Mark)
and support  the guys which  are making  still very  usefull software  for this
dying system.
Ok, what about some  features of this new  tool. At first I must mention that I
don't have a later version of SELECTR!C for making a real comparison.
It features  the wellknown  functions like copying, moving, touch, info etc. no
question. But you can  also stretch the box  over the whole screen and it looks
very strange. You can colourize  the items (folders  are red, program-files are
blue and  the rest is black) for a  better  overview. And  there are  a load of
other options, but the question is if you really  need this stuff. Another good
point is  the drive-info, it is much  quicker as in SELECTR!C where my harddisk
is ransacking  around for  about 1o seconds  to show the  info a  simple 1oo MB
partition. But  for this B0XKiTE  losses again  a point in comparison  with the
other one when I take a look at the  whole speed, because it's all in all a bit
slower in appearing  and vanishing from the screen. But good is also the option
the change the mask-buttons  because at least  my old SELECTR!C-version doesn't
feature this possibility, don't know about later versions (I've v1.1o).
For me  it isn't  easy to survey, eventually  because I  had used SELECTR!C for
some years and it is unusual for me to have the menu-button on another point or
to  see a completely  different styled  box. Anyway I had installed B0XKiTE for
some days  on my machine and now I have removed  it again, because it was a bit
too long-winded  for me to use  it in the way  I had done  with SELECTR!C (some
copy-jobs etc.). Perhaps you like it much  more as me and so I think you should
get it to build your own opinion about it...
Finally  the conclusion: B0XKiTE  is a  very good  rival  for SELECTR!C  and it
disproves the subtitle of it... because "...there CAN'T be only one..." ;)
BTW... there is also a "free" version of v1.81 around, done by the no1 again...
       and what means it for us? Vectronix dominating the world!!! hehe...

I have to go... [Î]ÓV!L¯s Ÿ0ù signing off...
