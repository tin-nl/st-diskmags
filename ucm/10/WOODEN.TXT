                         "THE MAN ON THE WOODEN CROSS"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released 1993 by INRI REC / Discordia

This is the second album of my favourite wave-band and let me say it right now:
it is a big step forward in every thing! The first one had featured much really
brutal lyrics  and sometimes very  strange and minimalistic electro-sounds. Now
the texts  are much better, with the right pinch  of their hidden  viciousness.
Also the sound has  changed and is much more melodic and with more synthie-pop-
elements created, without loosing the wellknown acoustic-guitar-stuff.
But before I write too much I will give you a list of the...

contents

01. The Guardians Of The 7th Universe
02. No Paradise
03. On The Other Side '93
04. Benetton-Girl
05. Close Your Eyes
06. Strange Girl
07. The Crystal Lake
08. The Parting
09. For A Short Moment
10. I don't Love You Anymore '92
11. Aj Na
12. The Daughter Of The Sun
13. The Man On The Wooden Cross

Hum, what should I say. The two remakes of older songs: "On The Other Side" and
"I Don't Love You Anymore" aren't bad and especially the second is a bit better
as the original version (except the acoustic one).
But also the new stuff is  great. Alone the  intro-track shows  that they don't
have  lost their real vicious style and the  atmosphere  of this track  is very
threatening...
Wow, and right the first song kicks  your mood down  into the cellar, with very
sad lyrics, the trembling and whimpering voice of Felix and the nice sound with
slow piano and fast  refrain-passages... it's one of my favourite songs on this
album, no  question, because it  leaves a  split impression  between  verse and
refrain... depression and hope (at least hidden in the brightening sound).
Ok, I will not loose any words about the remakes here... I like them, even if I
prefer the old version of "On The Other Side".
Other  really  good  songs  are "Benetton-Girl", "The  Parting", "For  A  Short
Moment" and ofcourse the last one "The Man On The Wooden Cross".
"The Parting" is one of the  slowest and most sad songs on this album, at least
for me, meanwhile the last one is a real pop-song and could go into the charts,
some years ago  ofcourse. A very  strange song is "For A Short Moment", because
it uses german and english lyrics...
A short conclusion? No problem... if you like synthie-pop  and wave in style of
the late eighties and the beginning nineties, with sensefull and not too simple
lyrics (I mean the hidden messages!) and ofcourse the right level of melancholy
you should buy this one! It's not such a "self-murderer-album" (Jenny's meaning
of "TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE") but leaves  sometimes also  a very bad feeling in
the stomach and  can ofcourse force  you to let the tears roll down when you're
in a bad state...

_THE GUARDIANS OF THE 7TH UNIVERSE_

Tiny splinters of amber start to circling around her delated pupils
Around a black sun that will never let you sleep quiet again
Tanze den Mond
Die Ewigkeit beginnt jetzt

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_NO PARADISE_

Can you tell me where's the light in your eyes
I remember you laughing like a child
Now you talk to me with a failing voice
Looking so much older than you are

Can you tell me babe
Where are the stars in your eyes
Can you tell me
There's no paradise

Tell me why did you lose all your dreams
You wanted to change the world
Now you're falling down like a withered leaf
Even too weak to change yourself

A liquid sky like running ink
White crystals in a burning ocean
Crucified with needles
There's no paradise

Your blood is pouring down your arms
Your future in a sooty spoon
Crucified with needles
There's no paradise

Can you tell me where's the light in your eyes
I remember you laughing like a child
Now you get lost in the twilight zone
Engulfed by infinite darkness

A liquid sky like running ink
Whity crystals in a burning ocean
crucified with needles
There's no paradise

_ON THE OTHER SIDE_

Do you remember slow-motion-times
With little golden stars
I see you tumble in the streets
I hold your hand in the cinema
A piece of heaven in a rotten world
You disappeared in a roaring night
I could die
I cry

On the other side I'll see you again
On the other side we'll walk hand in hand

I saw you again with tears in your eyes
My heart beats hard
Time doesn't move in a picture
But I can't live in the past
Life is easy
If you don't care about the future
And it's easy to smile
If you don't care about the truth
I still love you
But I've changed myself

On the other side I'll see you again
On the other side we'll walk hand in hand

_BENETTON-GIRL_

She's looking like a living doll
A real beauty-nice and clean
Dressed up like a model
In a fashion magazine
She's fresh like cold orange-juice
No alcohol she doesn't smoke
She's still living with her parents
And some teddy-bears on her bed

Cherry-red lips like blood in a white painted face
Pearls of sperm on blue-lacquered fingernails
Living colors singing birds
She never had a findish thought
She's laughing clear and warm
Like the bells of Santa Claus

Cherry-red lips like blood in a white painted face
Pearls of sperm on blue-lacquered fingernails
I think I take her by the hand
And spend my life in Disneyland
I would like to fall in love with a Benetton-girl

_CLOSE YOUR EYES_

You can close your eyes
I hold you like a child
Your head on my shoulder
The taste of your tears
You think that I'm strong
But it's hard to find the right words
I feel like a schoolboy when I sing this song
When I sing this song
When I sing this song for you

You don't need to talk
I think I understand
There's so much confusion and no way out
Maybe I'm too old and maybe you're too young
Maybe it's ridiculous when I sing this song
When I sing this song
When I sing this song for you

Ohoh, I've never been thinking that I would ever fall in love again
Ohoh, I've never been thinking that I would ever fall in love with you
With you

You can close your eyes
You can close your eyes
Watch me bleeding

_STRANGE GIRL_

Oh what a strange girl
The bluest eyes in the universe
A pale skin like ivory
I don't know where's she coming from
She says we can fly together through the night
What a strange girl

Oh she takes me by the hand
And she says with a twinkle
"Keep your eyes wide open"
Then we lose the ground under our feet and we start to float
Oh - higher and higher
We are swimming in the sky like floating birds
The flashing citylights
Like a tiny model railway on a playroom called earth
What a strange girl

Oh what a strange girl
The bluest eyes in the universe
A pale skin like ivory
She still holds my hand
And I feel the loving kindness of the twinkling stars
What a strange girl

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_THE CRYSTAL LAKE_

I haven't seen you for so long
Under this starless sky
And now you're here

A strange vibration in the air
A hidden promise in your eyes
So close

Oh - I don't wanna start again
Who's that boy running around with you?
I don't wanna start again

I don't want you
To play the starring role
In my diary again

I'm a little bit confused
Maybe it's only too much alcohol
But I'm afraid that it is you
Who makes me start stuttering

It seems to be so far away
That I lost all my pride
It doesn't hurt anymore
It seems to be like yesterday
When all my wishes died
It doesn't hurt anymore

A crystal lake covered with ice
Quiet and motionless
All alone
The rain is falling down in sheets
I'm waiting here in this room
All alone

Oh - I don't wanna start again
Who's that boy running around with you...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_THE PARTING_

We are dancing like colored leaves in the wind
Our pale faces in the autumn mist
Pearls of rain on our skin
Sleep! Sleep oh child!
We'll never be so close again

Do I really love you?
Do you really love me?
Is it just a dream?

I see my face in your face
I hear my voice in your voice
Mirrors to satisfy our vanity
And empty words to daze our solitude

We are falling like withered leaves in silence
Pearls of tears on our skin
Love's not made for eternity
Only death lasts forever
Sleep! Sleep oh child!
We'll never be so close again

Do I really love you?
Do you really love me?
Is it just a dream?

_FOR A SHORT MOMENT_

Und wieder ein blutiger MTV-Sonntag
Unrasiert, verschmierter Kajal
Nur das Telefon zerreiût gelegentlich die Stille
Frîhlichkeit, Melancholie
FÅr einen kurzen Augenblick sind wir uns nah und wieder allein
Vogelgezwitscher-Samples
Kirchenglocken
Nur ich und Dein Lippenstift am Rand der Kaffeetasse
Noch immer klingt Dein Lachen
Doch selbst wenn wir uns lieben
Bleiben wir uns fremd

Another bloody MTV-sunday
Unshaved, smeared mascara
Only the telephone sometimes breaks the silence
Happiness, melancholy
Bird's chirping-samples
Churchbells
It's only me and your lipstick on the edge of a coffee cup
I still feel the sound of your laughter
But even when we love each other
We are strangers
For a short moment we are close and alone again

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE_

Waiting on the telephone
I can't leave the room
Maybe you call me when I'm through the door
All these hopeless hours staring at the wall
I can't move my body
I can't sleep

The sky is dark and noisy voices in my head
They tell me that I'm free again now
No more chains
Free again

Hey Hey Hey, I don't love you anymore

I look into the mirror
A strangers watching me
Trembling lips a cold shining in his eyes
The cage of my broken body
Only one way to escape
A screaming nightmare
I dream in red

The sky is dark and noisy voices in my head
They tell me that I'm free again now
No more chains
Free again

Tîte sie! Tîte sie! Tîte sie!

I see your face in the crowd
Now it's time to die
I see fear and loathing in your eyes
Why don't you touch me babe?
This is the end
Come and feel the cold knife in my hand
Hey Hey Hey

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

_Aj Na_

The rain is falling down
Can you hear the silence?
Can you hear my voice?
Pale in the autumn mist

Aj Na
Where are you now?
I'm waiting here on mother earth

I'm running up the hill
I look to the stars
I can see for miles and miles
But you're out of sight

Aj Na
Where are you now?
I'm waiting here on planet earth
Aj Na
Where are you now?
I'm waiting here on mother earth

I'm lost in this world
No way to the universe
In my ivory-tower
I wait for your rise
The rise of the dead
It's her resurrection-day

_THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN_

Haunted by the memories of 88
When Satan was right here on earth
I love you girl 'til the end of time

We were the children of the moon
Pale and blind defeated by the evil one
I love you girl 'til the end of time

I don't believe in Jesus Christ
There's no god where I am
But I can feel your love inside
I believe in you

You're here in my heart
You're here in my mind
You will never die
You will never die
Sorrows
So much sorrows
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you my love

Haunted by the memories of 88
A fire is burning in my heart
I believe in you 'til the end of time
'til the end of time

I don't believe in Jesus Christ
There's no god where I am
But I can feel your love inside
I believe in you
Sorrows
So much sorrows
You'll never die

_THE MAN ON THE WOODEN CROSS_

Suffering in silence - alone again
On an island called my bed
Just another endless sleepless night
With this bandage around my head

The nurse is coming in with a lovely smile
She feels the fast beat of my tired heart
My body temperature is rising every day
I am helpless like a little child
I leave my body
I leave this angry pain

There's a light brighter than a thousand suns
Should I walk into this light
Or should I return into this broken body
It's alright ma
I'm only bleeding
I've never been afraid to die

I don't believe in Jesus Christ
I don't believe in paradise
The man on the wooden cross
Is he watching me or did he fall asleep?
The man on the wooden cross
Does he care for me or did he fall asleep?
