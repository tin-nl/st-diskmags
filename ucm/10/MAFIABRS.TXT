Oooooh... you really don't know what I had thought as I've seen this game! I'll
say the truth: after only one minute I was  save that the Atari is dead! I have
seen tons of shit in the last years, really! There are some people around which
thinking they can release any dumb trash, but this game blows away every limit
and any frontier! It is only  embarrassing what  those people  from scandinavia
have released with this little piece of shit!
Ok, it's right  that a real strategic game needs more gameplay as great grafix,
no question  and at the other point a strategic game offers not the possibility
to  include brainblasting  animations and action-scenes. It  lives more or less
only from the concept.
The concept of this game is very simple: you take over the job of mafia-boss in
the year 1914 and you  have to "work" to be THE boss. Your opponents are humans
or computer controlled. So you can make the  wellknown unserious stuff, you can
burn down casinos, steel cars and so one. All in one nothing special and if you
have ever  heard about the  german game "Mafia - The Game 2" you know all about
this game.
Ok, that's for  the concept and it  could be a little bit funny to play against
other people, against the computer it's only boring.
But the technical  side of the game is SHIT! Grafix? No, REALLY NO GRAFIX! Only
some text-stuff  in different crude colors. And  in the year of 1997 you should
burn on the electric chair for making a game without any grafix!
Therefore you have a load on sampled sounds and this is the reason to spare out
all the STF-owner. Wow! Really stupid!
The control is  also for the trashcan. You  have to press some keys and this is
all. Sometimes the screen is fullfilled with text-stuff and you don't know what
key you should press  to go on... but it doesn't  matter! The best  thing is to
format the  disk and search  for other stuff. This  piece of  horrible software
(it's coded in  HiSoft Basic... that says all) isn't even worth the place to be
mentioned here.
When I see such stuff I'm angry that I never have changed the  system! And if I
take a look around I can understand that the Atari is dying! The last surviving
users were bombed out with tons of hideous demos, senseless compact-disx, tools
for the dump  and stupid games  like this one. Quality  stuff? About 10% of all
releases are really worth a look and this isn't enough to keep the Atari alive!
