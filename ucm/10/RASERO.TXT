After  the great SENIOR DADS  started to torment  our nerves with crazy demos a
lot of other  fake-bands started to do  the same. There were some guys like the
FISK KOMPANIET who were also skilled coders and not only lamers and freaks like
the ultra-lame IPIR. But as  it seems  the SENIOR DADS  were the only  ones who
survived, up to now. The guys from Poland showed us that there's a real and big
demo-scene in their country and so it was only a question of time that also the
fake demo bands appeared on the screen.
Don't know who they are (FISK KOMPANIET or SENIOR DADS are also only fake-names
of real and overall skilled demo-bands. I know who they are =) ...) but it does
not matter.
Ok, some words  about this "demo"? No problem. It runs ONLY on ST/E and ONLY in
Hires. I  can't  remember which  demo was the  last one  for monochrome only. I
think  it was a slideshow  by .tnb. from 1994. So there are some limits set for
this demo. And finally the things I had expected happened: you can see only
some flickering screens, dull grafix and a load of messages like ATARI IS DEAD,
YO LAMERS, YO SUCKERS, KILL ATARI, WE LOVE BILL GATES and other shit like that.
Erm. What  the hell?! I  know it's  only fake. But  some funny stuff  should be
included in a demo, not only faked slaggings.
There are three chip-tunes  included, all composed by the great JESS / OVR. But
they aren't able  to replay them in  the right frequency and so they're to fast
in monochrome... sounds really shitty.
The only thing which seems  not to faked is the greetings-list. All other stuff
isn't worth to be mentioned. I have deleted  the demo after watching it. It has
not the style  of SENIOR DADS  productions and  it seems  that they  will never
reach them. Sorry, but  I think  also a fake-demo  needs more  as only to belch
senseless around...
