                            THE SMASHING PUMPKINS
                  "Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Virgin 1995

And finally I had the possibility to take an "ear" to this PUMPKINS-album. It's
not the latest, but it's the longest album of them, at least of my knowledge...
With this thing they've broken records, because  a normal full-time-album isn't
mostly longer  as an hour and  many bands even  doesn't reach  this. These guys
here have released a full-time-album on TWO CD's and  both are good filled. But
as you know, not only  quantity but also quality is important and if a band has
released 28 songs  with one hit it  can surely be that  there is a load of shit
included... But before I start to justify I will give you a overview about the:

Yawn... 28 songs, more as two  hours of music! And as  I have written above, by
this mass of songs not everyone can be an earworm.
I think  I must not  leave any  words about the  music-style of this band, some
songs are a powerful mixture  of metal and  rock with a  touch of grunge sound,
others are  slow and dreamlike. I think  this gives a right view about the very
large scale of their  sound. But all songs living from the strange voice of the
singer Billy Corgan. It  gives a own mark to the whole songs and you will never
have any problems to recognize a SMASHING PUMPKINS title.
But let me say that I  don't like their "hard" songs very much, they're to loud
and to  strange for  me, not so  my thing. But I love their ballads and I think
there is  no other band  of this  kind around  which produces  so many  quality
ballads, about the  half of the songs on this album are slower ones and  for me
the  nicest  are: "Tonight, Tonight", "Galapogos", "Thirty-Three", "In The Arms
Of Sleep" and "1979" and of course some of the other songs.
Hum, I will  break right now, because  I have to type  in  the lyrics and so be
prepared for about 900 lines of pure PUMPKINS-stuff...

TONIGHT, TONIGHT

time is never time at all
you can never ever leave
without leaving a piece
of youth
and your lives are
forever changed
we will never be the same
the more you change the less you feel
believe, believe in me, believe
that life can change, that you're not
stuck in vain
we're not the same, we're different tonight
tonight, so bright
tonight
and you know you're never sure
but you're sure you could be right
if you held yourself up to the light
and the embers never fade in your city
by the lake
the place where you were born
believe, believe in me, believe
in the resolute urgency of now
and if you believe there's not a chance tonight
tonight, so bright
tonight
we'll crucify the insincere tonight
we'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight
we'll find a way to offer up the night tonight
the indescribable moments of your life tonight
the impossible is possible tonight
believe in me as i believe in you, tonight

JELLYBELLY

welcome to nowhere fast
nothing here ever lasts
nothing but memories
of what never was
we're nowhere, we're nowhere
we're nowhere to be
nowhere, we're nowhere
we're nowhere to see
living makes me sick
so sick i wish i'd die
down in the belly of the beast
i can't die
you're nowhere, you're nowhere
you're nowhere to be
nowhere, you're nowhere
you're nowhere to see
there's nothing left to do
there's nothing left to feel
doesn't matter what you want, so
to make yourself feel better
you make it so you'll never
give in to your forevers
and live for always
and forever
forever, you're forever to be
forever, forever, you're forever to me

ZERO

my reflection
dirty mirror
there's no connection
to myself i'm your lover
i'm your zero
i'm the face in your dreams of glass
so save your prayers
for when we're really gonna need 'em
throw out your cares and fly
she's the one for me
wanna go for a ride?

she's all i really need
cause she's the one for me
emptiness is loneliness, and loneliness
is cleanliness
and cleanliness is godliness, and god is empty
just like me
intoxicated with the madness, i'm in love with
my sadness
bullshit fakes, anchanted kingdoms
the fashion victims shwe their charcoal teeth
i never let on, that i was on a sinking ship
i never let on that i was down
you blame yourself, for what you can't ignore
you blame yourself for wanting more
she's the one for me
she's all i really need
she's the one for me
she's my one and only

HERE IS NO WHY

the useless drag of another day
the endless drags of a death rock boy
mascara sure and lipstick lost
glitter burned by restless thoughts
of being forgotten
and in your sad machines
you'll forever stay
desperate and displeased
with whoever you are
and you're a star somewhere
he pulls his hair down
over a frowning smile
a hidden diamond you cannot find
a secret star that cannot shine over to you
may the king of gloom, forever be doomed
and in your sad machines
you'll forever stay
burning up in speed
lost inside the dreams, of teen machines
the useless drags, the mepty days
the lonely towers of long mistakes
to forgotten faces and faded loves
sitting still was never enough
and if you're giving in, then you're giving up
cause in your
sad machines
you'll forever stay
burning up in speed
lost inside the dreams
of teen machines

BULLET WITH BUTTERFLY WINGS

the world is a vampire, sent to drain
secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames
and what do i get, for my pain
betrayed desires, and a piece of the games
even though i know
i suppose i'll show
all my cool and cold
like old job
despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
now i'm naked, nothing but an animal
but can you fake it, for just one more show
and what do you want, i want to change
and what have you got
whan you feel the same
even though i know
i suppose i'll show
all my cool and cold
like old job
despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
tell me i'm the only one
tell me there's no other one
jesus was an only son
tell me i'm the chosen one
jesus was an only son for you
despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage
and i still believe that i cannot be saved

TO FORGIVE

ten times removed
i forget about where it all began
bastard son of a bastard son of
a wild eyed child of the sun
and right as rain,
i'm not the same but
i feel the same, i feel nothing
holding back the fool again
holding back the fool pretends
i forget to forget nothing
is important
holding back the fool again
i sensed my loss
before i even learned to talk
and i remember my birthdays
empty party afternoons won't
come back
holding back the fool again
holding back the fool pretends
i forget to forget nothing is important
holding back the fool again
i forget to forget me
i forget to forget you see
nothing is important to me
i knew my loss
before i even learned to speak
and all along, i knew it was wrong
but i played along, with my birthday song
holding back the fool again
holding back the fool pretends
i forget to forget nothing is important
holding back the fool again

FUCK YOU (AN ODE TO NO ONE)

i'm never coming back
i'm never giving in
i'll never be the shine in your spit
i disconnect the act
i disconnect the dots
i disconnect the me in me
and you're mistaken, it's you that's faking
living and breathing and dying too
this message is for anyone who dares to hear a fool
you can't bring me back, you can't bring me back
cause i give it all back to you
thru sacred alleys, the living wrecks
wreak their havoc upon this world
the disenchanted, the romantics, the body and
face and soul of you is gone down that
deep black hole
destroy the mind
destroy the body
but you cannot destroy the heart
and you, you make me so i need to disconnect
and you make it so real
i don't need your love to disconnect
to runaround kids in get-go cars
with vaseline afterbirths and neon coughs
galaxies full of nobodies
giving us farewell runarounds
i took a virgin mary axe to his sweet baby jane
lost my innocence to a no good girl, scratch my
face with anvil hands, and coil my tongue
around a bumblebee mouth
and i give it all back to you
no way, i don't need it, i don't need your love
to disconnect
and you make it, so real, i don't need your love
to disconnect
no way to disconnect
i don't need your love to disconnect
no way to disconnect

LOVE

to my mistakes, to my mistakes of cowardice
she shimmy shakes, the jimmy jakes
of consequence
born of the air and dues, my airs of madness
do declare
that it's ok, it's love
it's what you wnated to see, it's who you
wanted to be
for what you needed to need, she'll make it up
love, it's who you know
machine gun blues, her vacant rush is so steel
i'm unaware, lost inside your visions
i got mine too over, i got mine and i got you
cause i know you, you're love
it's what you wanted to see, it's who you
wanted to be
for what you needed to need, she'll make it up
love, it's who you know
can i look up to you as you look down on me
can i feel in to you as you felt in to me
i can't help what you see, i can't help but to be
for what i needed to need, she'll make it
love, it's who you know

CUPID DE LOCKE

cupid had pulled back his sweetheart's bow
to cast divine arrows into her soul
to grab her attention swift and quick
or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
with turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

see the devil may do as the devil may care
he loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
her mouth the mischief he doth seek
her heart the captive of which he speaks
so note all ye lovers in love with the sound
your world be shattered with nary a note
of one cupids arrow under your coat

and in the land of star crossed lovers
and barren hearted wanderers
forever lost in forsaken missives and satan's pull
we seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable
our hopes dead gathering dust to dust
in faith, in compassion, and in love

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

GALAPOGOS

ain't it funny how we pretend we're still a child
softly stolen under our blanket skies
and rescue me from me, and all that i believe
i won't deny the pain
i won't deny the change
and should i fall from grace here with you
will you leave me too?

carve out your heart for keeps in an old oak tree
and hold me for goodbyes
and whispered lullabyes
and tell me i am still
the man i'm supposed to be
i won't deny the pain
i won't deny the change
and should i fall from grace here with you
will you leave me too?

too late to turn to turn back now
i'm running out of sound
and i am changing, changing
and if we died right now, this fool you
love somehow
is here with you
i won't deny the pain
i won't deny the change
and should i fall from grace here with you
would you leave me too?

MUZZLE

i fear that i am ordinary, just like everyone
to lie here and die among the sorrows
adrift among the days
for everything i ever said
and everything i've ever done is gone and dead
as all things must surely have to end
and great loves will one day have to part
i know that i am meant for this world
my life has been extraordinary
blessed and cursed and won
time heals but i'm forever broken
by and by the way...
have you ever heard the words
i'm singing in these song?
it's for the girl i've loved all along
can a taste of love be so wrong
as all things must surely have to end
and great loves will one day have to part
i know that i am meant for this world
and in my mind as i was floating far above the clouds
some children laughed i'd fall for certain
for thinking that i'd last forever
but i knew exactly where i was
and i knew the meaning of it all
and i knew the distance to the sun
and i knew the echo that is love
and i knew the secrets in your spires
and i knew the emptiness of youth
and i knew the solitude of the heart
and i knew the murmurs of the soul
and the world is drawn into your hands
and the world is etched upon your heart
and the world so hard to understand
is the world you can't live without
and i knew the silence of the world

PORCELINA OF THE VAST OCEANS

as far as you take me, that's where i believe
the realm of soft delusions, floating on the leaves
on a distant shoreline, she waves her arms to me
as all the thought police, are closing for sleep
the dilly dally, of my bright lit stay
the steam of my misfortunes
has given me the power to be afraid
and in my mind i'm everyone
and in my mind
without a care in this whole world
without a care in this life
it's what you take that makes it right
porcelina of the ocean blue
in the slipstream, of thoughtless thoughts
the light of all that's good
the light of all that's true
to the frings gladly, i walk unadorned
with gods and their creations
with filth and disease
porcelina, she waits for me there
with seashell hissing lullabyes
and whispers fathomed deep inside my own
hidden thoughts and alibis
my secret thoughts come alive
without a care in this whole world
without a care in this life
it's what you take that makes it right
and in my mind i'm everyone
in my mind i'm everyone of you
you make it right
it's all allright
you make it right
porcelina of the oceans blue

TAKE ME DOWN

take me down, to the underground
won't you take me down, to the underground
why oh why, there is no light
and if i can't sleep, can you hold my life
and all i see is you
take my hand, i lost where i began
in my heart i know all of my faults
will you help me understand
and i believe in you
you're the other half of me
soothe and heal...
when you sleep, when you dream
i'll be there if you need me
whenever i hear you sing...
there is a sun, it'll come, the sun
i hear them call me down
i held you once, a loved that once
and life had just begun
and you're all i see...
and trumpets blew
and angels flew on the other side
and you're all i see
and you're all i'll need
there's a love that
god puts in your heart

WHERE BOYS FEAR TO TREAD

candy cane walks down
to build a bonfire, to break my fall
my baby, my sweet thing
just maybe we could lose ourselves this time
king of the horseflies, dark prince of death
his tragic forces are heaven sent
in sweet things, in a lovers breath
in knowing this was meant to be the last
a go-go-kids, a go-go-style
a suck suck kiss, a suck suck smile
as always, in young need
a veiled promise to never die
on dead highways, her black beauties roam
for june angels, so far from home
for a love lost, a faded picture
to tread lightning, to ink the lavender skies
so get on the bomb
get back where you belong

BODIES

cast the pearls aside, of a simple life of need
come into my life forever
the crumbled cities stand as known
of the sights you have been shown
of the hurt you call your own
love is suicide

the empty bodies stand at rest
casualties of their own flesh
afflicted by their dispossession
but no bodies ever knew
nobodys
no bodies felt like you
nobodys
love is suicide

now we drive the night, to the ironies of peace
you can't help deny forever
the tragedies reside in you
the secret sights hide in you
the lonely nights divide you in two
all my blisters now revealed
in the darkness of my dreams
in the space in between us
but no bodies ever knew
nobodys
no bodies felt like you
nobodys
love is suicide

THIRTY-THREE

speak to me in a language i can hear
humour me before i have to go
deep in thought i forgive everyone
as the cluttered streets greet me once again
i know i can't be late, supper's waiting
on the table
tomorrow's just an excuse away
so i pull my colar up and face the cold
on my own
the earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
at the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
steeple guide me to my heart and home
the sun is out and up and down again
i know i'll make it, love can last forever
graceful swans of never topple to the earth
and you can make it last, forever you
you can make it last, forever you
and for a moment i lose myself
wrapped up in the pleasure of the world
i've journeyed here and there and back again
but in the same old haunts i still find my friends
mysteries not ready to reveal
sympathies i'm ready to return
i'll make the effort, love can last forever
graceful swans of never topple to the earth
tomorrow's just an excuse
and you can make it last, forever you
you can make it last, forever you

IN THE ARMS OF SLEEP

sleep will not come to tired body now
peace will not come to this lonely heart
there are some things i'll live without
but i want you to know that i need you right now
i need you tonite
i steal a kiss from her sleeping shadow moves
cause i'll always miss her wherever she goes
and i'll always need her more than she could ever need me
i need someone to ease my mind
but sometimes a someone is so hard to find
and i'll do anything to keep her here tonite
and i'll say anything to make her feel alright
and i'll be anything to keep her here tonite
cause i want you to stay, with me
i need you tonite
she comes to me like an angel out of time
as i play the part of a saint on my knees
there are some things i'll live without
but i want you to know that i need you right now
suffer my desire
suffer my desire
suffer my desire for you

1979

shakedown 1979, cool kids never have the time
on a live wire right up off the street
you and i should meet
junebug skipping like a stone
with the headlights pointed at the dawn
we were sure we'd never see an end to it all
and i don't even care to shake these
zipper blues
and we don't know
just where our bones will rest
to dust i guess
forgotten and absorbed into the earth below
double cross the vacant and th bored
they're not sure just what we have in store
morphing city slippin dues down to see
that we don't even care as restless as we are
we feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
and poured cement, lamented and assured
to the light and towns below
faster than we thought we'd go
beneath the sound of hope
justine never knew the rules
hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
no apologies ever need be made
i know you better than you fake it
to see that we don't care to shake these
zipper blues
and we don't know just where our bones will rest
to dust i guess
forgotten and absorbed into earth below
the street heats the urgency of sound
as you can see there's no one around

TALES OF A SCORCHED EARTH

farewell goodnight last one out turn out the lights
and let me be, let me die inside
let me know the way from of this world of hate i know
cause the dye is cast, and the bitch is back
and we're all dead yeah we're all dead
inside the future of a shattered past
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening?
because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
bless the martyrs and kiss the kids
for knowing better, for knowing this
cause you're all whores and i'm a fag
and i've got no mother and i've got no dad
to save me the wasted, save me from myself
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening?
because beyond my hopes there are no feelings
everybody's lost just waiting to be found
everyone's a thought just waiting to fade
so fuck it all cause i don't care
so what somehow somewhere we dared
to try to dare to dare for a little more
i lie just to be real, and i'd die just to feel
why do the same old things keep on happening?
because beyond my hopes there are no reasons

THRU THE EYES OF RUBY

wrap me up in always, and drang me in with maybes
your innocence is treasure, your innocence is death
your innocence is all i have
breathing underwater and living under glass
and if you spin your love around
the secrets of your dreams
you may find your love is gone
and is not quite what it seemed
to appear to disappear
beneath all your darkest fears
i believe in never, i believe in all the way
but belief is not to notice
belief is just some faith
and faith can't help you to escape
and with this ring i wed thee true
and with this ring i wed thee now
and with this ring i play so dead
but no one's asking for the truth
so let me tell you
if you spin your love around
the secrets of your dreams
you may find your love is gone
and is not quite what it seemd
to appear to disappear
beneath all your darkest fears
to the revelations of fresh faced youth
no one will come to save you
so speak your peace in the murmurs drawn
but youth is wasted on the young
your strength is my weakness, your weakness my hate
my love for you just can't explain
why we're forever frozen, forever beautiful
forever lost inside ourselves
the night has come to hold us young

X.Y.U.

she didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
she couldn't run away cause she was crazy
she gave it all away, she saw her baby break
and in the air it hung that she was dull razors
and i said, i wanna fill you up, i wanna break
you, i wanna give you up, from one another
another one should come to one another
no one should come between us
still i was lonely, and she was by my side
my one and only, knows that she could never hide
i couldn't feel her, and it was just a game
cause i was lonely and she was crazy
rat-tat-tat, ka boom boom
now take that, and just a bit of this
cause i'm a watcher, and i'm a doer of none
come to save you, cause you're all mine
i hurt where i can't know, i bleed for me and mine
ka-boom, a rat-tat-tat, and some good ole bliss
cause i'm a sister, and i'm a motherfuck
i am made of shamrocks, i am made of stern stuff
i am never enough, i am the forgotten child
and i said i wanna give you up, from one another
no one should ever come in between us
between us and our love
mary had a little lamb, her face was white as snow
and everywhere that mary went i was sure to go
now mary's got a problem
and mary's not a stupid girl
mary's got some deep shit
and mary does not forget
and this is how mary's garden grows
and this is how mary has her ghosts
and into the eyes of the jackyl i say ka-boom
now we begin descent, to where we've never been
there is no going back, this wasn't meant to last
this is a hell on earth, we are meant to serve
and she will never learn
bye bye, baby goodbye

WE ONLY COME OUT AT NIGHT

we only come out at night
the days are much too bright
we only come out at night
and once again, you'll pretend to know me
well, my friends
and once again, i'll pretend to know the way
thru the empty space
thru the secret places of the heart
we only come out at night
the days are much too bright
we only come out at night
i walk alone, i walk alone to find the way home
i'm on my own, i'm on my own to see the ways
that i can't help the days, you will make it home o.k.
i know you can, and you can
we only come out at night
the days are much too bright
we only come out to night
and once again, you'll pretend to know that
there's an end, that there's an end to this begin
it will help you sleep at night
it will make it seem that right is always right
alright?
we only come out at night

BEAUTIFUL

beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sun
wonderful, you're wonderful, as wonderful as they come
and i can't help but feel attached
to the feelings i can't even match
with my face pressed up to the glass wanting you
beautiful, you're beautiful, as beautiful as the sky
wonderful, it's wonderful, to know that you're just like i
and i'm sure you know me well
as i'm sure you don't
but you just can't tell
who'll you love and who you won't
and i love you, as you love me
so let the clouds roll by your face
we'll let the world spin on to another place
we'll climb the tallest tree above it all
to look down on you and me and them
and i'm sure you know me well
as i'm sure you don't
but you just can't tell
who you'll love and you you won't
don't let your life wrap up around you
don't forget to call, whenever
i'll be here just waiting for you
i'll be under your stars forever
neither here nor there just right beside you
i'll be under the stairs forever
neither here nor there just right beside you

LILY (MY ONE AND ONLY)

lily, my one and only
i can hardly wait till i see her
silly, i know i'm silly
cause i'm hanging in this tree
in the hopes that she will catch a glimpse of me
and thru her window shade
i watch her shadow move
i wonder if she...?
lily, my one and only
love is in my heart and in your eyes
will she or won'r she want him
no one knows for sure
but an officer is knocking at my door
and thru her window shade
i watch her shadow move
i wonder if she could only see me?
and when i'm with her i feel fine
if i could kiss her
i wouldn't mind the time
it took to find
my lily, my one and only
i can hardly wait till i see her
oh lily, i know you love me
cause as they're draggin me away
i swear i saw her raise
her hand and wave
(goodbye)

BY STARLIGHT

by starlight i'll kiss you
and promise to be your one and only
i'll make you feel happy
and leave you to be lost in mine
and where will we go, what will we do?
soon said i, will know
dead eyes, are you just like me?
cause her eyes were as vacant as the seas
dead eyes, are you just like me?
and all along, we knew we'd carry on
just to belong
by starlight i know you
as lovely as a wish granted true
my life has been empty
my life has been untrue
and does she really know, who i really am?
does she really know me at last
dead eyes, are you just like me?

FAREWELL AND GOODNIGHT

goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tite
may it hold you through the winter of a long night
and keep you from the loneliness of yourself
heart strung is your heart frayed and empty
cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love
it's unsung, and i say
goodnight, may love, to every hour in every day
goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your
head lite with the wishes of a sandmane and a night light
be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight nestled in your covers
the sun shines but i don't
a silver rain will wash away
and you can tell, it's just as well
goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day
goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's all (?!), I'm tired and will stop now... Goodnight!
