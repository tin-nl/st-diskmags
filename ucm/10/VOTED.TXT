Hum, not many voters and we don't have reached 50 votes this time because we
were a bit late with collecting the sheets. But so short before the limit I
don't want to stop the UCM-charts. Btw. where  the hell are the voters from
France, UK and Sweden?! We need every single sheet. So move your ass and vote!
BTW. Last time I had  warned a guy  who had voted three times. It seems that he
     has not learned about this lame thing and so it's time to out him! It does
     not care to  me, just fuck me  if you want, but it's the lamest thing ever
     and so go  to hell JOA/ORBY/RAMSESS or whatever your name is! It isn't the
     coolest thing to crack for two different groups and to use the name of the
     girlfriend as  cracking-pseudo, but  this time it was too much for me! You
     all know about ELiTE's  claim to be the  number one cracking band but it's
     very lame to move the name of the band to place number one with more votes
     as allowed. I don't think that this is the right way and it's some kind of
     poor for me. This shows all in my  eyes and you  should know that  not one
     single member of  VECTRONIX has voted...
