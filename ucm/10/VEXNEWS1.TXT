-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first I have to thank Phoenix of Vex for allowing us to include the Vex-News
into the UCM. At first I wanted to clip out only single parts but I  changed my
mind and the only things you will not find are the release-lists and the logos.
(I think one on top is enough, don't you think?!) Also the part "Publication of
contents is included only one time, at the end of the whole thing...
But now I  have to shut my mouth  and wish you  some great hours  while reading
this kewl underground-magazine...

                           VECTRONIX NEWS WEEK #24
                        Written by Phoenix/Vectronix
                            vectronix@hotmail.com

This is an attempt of spreading some news and information about what's
going on in the atari scene 1997, and what we're up to in Vectronix,
announcements of our  latest releases and other stuff. There is no weekly
publish dates or anything, when there's something to write about, and we
got time, we will do it... ;-)

If you know somebody who want to get this news letter in the future, please
tell them to send an email to vectronix@hotmail.com with the subject
"subscribe". If you want to be removed from the list, simply do the same
but with subject "un-subscribe" instead.

The Vectronix cracking team is proud to present a few new hot releases, in
this awfully hot, disgusting and painkilling summer. We can also introduce
new support boards and a new member.

New US/Germany HQ's
===================

In USA the Happy Hideaway BBS is still alive and kicking, I guess some of
you remember it from the "good old days" if not else. New software, new
look, same sysop (Harry) and now official VEX USHQ, check it out!

Ryder, our new member who will work for us as musician and also do some
trading is responsible for the US scene expecially, it's his job to support
Happy Hideaway, and if possible also other boards with new software. The US
scene had almost gone dead as I understand it, but we're doing our best to
bring it back to life again.

Other boards worth mentioning in USA is PayBax BBS runned by Norstar, I'm
quite sure our releases will be available on both H.H and PayBax, otherwise
we'll arrange this in some way. Then there's STampede (rings a bell, huh?)
which is still alive, even though it's mostly PC nowadays, there should
still be an old atari conference. Hopefully STampede can also be brought
back to life one day.

In Germany The Junction runned by Slapshot, which also is HQ for TSCC and
Elite among others will be our GHQ. The Junction which really is an amiga
board is one of Germanys most interesting boards of my knowledge. As I'm
writing this I'm not sure how distribution in Germany will work, but one
way or another you'll find our stuff here, that's for sure!

More HQ's and distros are on the way, but we want to make sure we can
support the boards first, watch out...

Faramir/Ex-Elite
================

As Elite never did a real official statement that Faramir left Elite I want
to make some things clear, as I still see lot's of confusion about this
subject.

Vectronix is NOT dead for Atari! As long as there is still a reason to hang
on to atari, which means, new stuff to crack every now and then, we'll be
around and do our best to provide you with high quality cracks, as always.

Faramirs attack upon us was due to his personal problems, obsession by
satan, microsoft and aliens. He couldn't accept that I (Phoenix) was using
a PC today and got all crazy. What started as a private argument some
months earlier was then brought official when he was banned from #atari and
started to release crap under Elite's name against us.

Anyway, this thing with Faramir is now history, and we're sorry it ever
happened. Our relations with Elite is, and have always been very good.
We're only sorry that Faramir dragged them into the shit, and got lot's of
people to think we was leaving atari.

Worth mentioning is also that Doctor Byte left Elite (because of Faramir),
and that Pervert joined again when Faramir left, he had previously left the
group together with Stratagem because of Faramir. Elite is now in the
leadership of Marcer, and it contains the whole polish cracking elite.

Zarmi/Ex-Supremacy
==================

He must be one of the most hated people on the atari scene, everybody knows
who he is. His relations with Elite have not been the best, which I guess
is one of the reasons he have made himself a name.

I'm sorry to say that I hear rumours that he have been busted for selling
CD's, I have not got any confirmations about this, and don't know much
more. No matter what you think of someone, getting busted is nothing you
wish your worst enemy. It's always sad when these things happens, and I'm
very sorry if this is true.

Take care out there people, selling CD's might be an easy way to earn some
fast money, but don't make too big business out of it, you might be sorry
for it one day, and I tell you, it's not worth it!

Nordic Atari Show 97
====================

Phoenix will attend the Nordic Atari Show (13-15 June) held in Gothenburg,
Sweden on Saturday 14:th of June. Watch out for a weird dude running
around, probably dressed black from top to bottom with black sunglasses.
Make sure all your originals are properly locked up into a safetybox and
keep calm.

Final Words
===========

That's it for this time, let's see what this developes into and hopefully
we'll be back shortly! Not that much is happening in the scene these days,
but sometimes there is a need to announce things, and to keep contact with
people. Please don't hesitate to contact us, vectronix@hotmail.com is the
address, and we try to answer all mails. Send us comments, complaints,
ideas or whatever, we'd love to hear from you!

                     VECTRONIX NEWS WEEK #24 (Addendum)
                        Written by Phoenix/Vectronix
                            vectronix@hotmail.com

Isn't it weird that something always comes up the next minute after you
have released something? It happens me all the time, some people would
probably explain this by the fact that I always gotta do everything in the
very last minute, and always in a hurry, but I don't know... ;-)

Today I had missed to read some new messages on my board, where I was
delighted to find an announcement.

Hang Loose is back, we've heard it before, a couple of times that Bandit
was planning on re-open his board. We almost stopped believing it, but
after much talk and little action, he have finally done just that.

I talked to Bandit some weeks ago, then he was hoping to get cable-modem
access in the area he lives real soon, if this was more than a sysops most
wished dream to become reality is yet to see. But let's hope for the best!

[2] The TRUE story of Zarmi (ex Supremacy) - Written by Senser/Vectronix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just saw vex news #24... And im totally not according to Phoenix/Vex
about zarmi... now some facts : everyone know that zarmi is a ripper and
its not a news... but less peoples know the real facts of the history...
I can speak of this coz im a member of Supremacy too.

1/ zarmi in Supremacy
At the beginning, zarmi entered in Supremacy (french cracking group)
starting to release games etc, no problems... but after a while we
discovered that we were fukked (esp zarmi) by some groups... The leader of
supremacy asked him why... he says "i dont know..." but, after, Gizmot (ex
Supremacy too) tells us that bcoz he ripped all cracks he ever released and
he was not able to crack a game! (mainly ripped from Elite and Vectronix
releases) zarmi was kicked off and Gizmot left the crew to enter in Elite
as 'Mr No' alias. (zarmi and gizmot were good friends before this
'incident')

2/ zarmi alone
After that, zarmi continued to rip games from BBSes, kicking the intros and
puting his hisoft basic 'intros' (i saw a source, its terrific!)... and he
won a lame name in the business... But after, the real shit happened.. not
happy for being kicked from Supremacy, zarmi started to release stuffs but
including the personal adresses and names of all the Supremacy members...
or sometimes he released some stuff directly signed with "hi I'm <real
name>, I cracked this software and my adress is <adress>... our leader had
some problems with editors because of this lamer and these stupid jokes...

3/ zarmi on BBS
I found on Heavens Trash some textfiles 'bout zarmi and Mr No... always
about the same things : zarmi ripped elite's crack (its true! compare the
stardust loader by Scorpio and the one by zarmi) and so on. but the best is
the answer of zarmi to Mr No (in full french of courze coz this stupid
lamer can't understand english), something like this : Elite are poor
lamers, I, zarmi The Master, never ripped any crack, i suspect that Elite
and Vex are jealous from me and rips my works... I'm the best, bla bla
bla... (this guy is a megalo!)

4/ zarmi and ME
zarmi found my adress on the french "minitel", a night, the phone rang,
guess who it was : zarmi... starting to tell me "you are a poor lamer in
Supremacy, Supremacy suxx, i will include your personal adress in my
intros" etc etc... and during more than 2 months, he phoned me EVERY nite,
at least i had an automatic answering system and volume control (ouf!)... i
think it was the same script with the others Supremacy members...

5/ zarmi and Mr No
zarmi did the same with Mr No... but he did something more, and thats why
he is in jail now... zarmi gave Mr no to da cops... (and he did a BIG
error) cops busted Mr No and Mr No (not as lame as i thought) made a deal
with the cops : he gave them zarmi. zarmi was busted, and Mr No testified
against him. Now zarmi is in jail and Mr No is free (but cops taken his
disks, modem and hd)

THIS is the true story, I'm not Phoenix, and i'm HAPPY because now this
shit is in jail, and he deserved it!


[3] Phoenix Comments about Zarmi
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't want anyone to think I'm defending Zarmi, rather the opposite. I
however wanted to have him under control, preventing him from doing his
lame thing, and I have tried to talk some sense with him several times.
Zarmis english is as good as my french though, so it never was much of
conversations.

So, why is there a reason to not just kickban such a looser from Heavens
Trash you might wonder? The answer is simple, he was always uploading new
stuff. Alot of crap, but also alot of good things, which is more I can say
about most other people today. I never had any contacts in France who could
modemtrade like Zarmi, and disk swapping (which I have understood Elite is
still doing) is simply not my kind of thing. I guess I didn't understand
until now how big this thing really was, but then again... I never had any
problems with him, and I have never seen any rips of our stuff coming from
him.

I still think it's very sad this story had to involve the cops, I don't
think they have anything with our businesses to do, and what can be more
lame than giving other scene people to the cops anyway, it's one thing to
argue with someone, but it's something completely different to get someone
busted....

[4] Vectronix/Heavens Trash File Archives CD Vol 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The long promised CD of the Heavens Trash file archives will be done
shortly! Phoenix have finally bought himself a CD-burner, and is right now
working on it (more or less). There's alot of work to be done, cleanup of
old crap, sorting and descriptions to write. The CD will probably cost
around 500 SEK and the price will include shipping anywhere in the world.
More details shortly! If you want to make sure you get one of these CD's,
get in touch with Phoenix and book your CD today!

I also hope nobody have missed Skinhead's excellent Atari Pirate Games Gold
Volume 1 CD which contains almost 2000 old ST/STE games, nicely sorted, MSA
packed and archived with descriptions. This is a real must have!


[5] Spreading the Warez
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We know there is a major problem today to get hold of new releases for
atari, and we are doing our best to change this. We're currently
establishing support boards all around the world, which will carry our
releases of course, but still the best and easiest way, and the place to
concentrate on must be, the internet! We however do need your help with
this....

If anyone already have or want to set up public 24 hour leech ftp site,
please get in touch with us and we'll be happy to support it! The size of
an atari warez site don't have to be very big, and the load of it probably
won't make an administrator suspicious even.

WWW sites is also an alternative to ftp, if you think you can be of any
help, please get in touch!

Then there is IRC leech bots also, which is quite popular on the PC scene.
If you can setup 24 hour bots, or atleast spend alot of time online (few
hours per day atleast) and think you can have an xdcc bot running during
this time, please get in touch!

We're doing our best to provide the few atarians which is left with high
quality releases, and the latest software. If you think you can help us in
some way, please don't hesitate to contact us!

/vectronix directory, both old as new ones. Note also that upload is
forbidden in this directory, only Vectronix members are allowed to upload
here, other uploads goes into /incoming as usual!


[3] Faramir - Defendor of the Human Race
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Faramir a.k.a Razor Dickhead or whatever he prefers to call himself today
when he calls people brainless, have on his homepage collected a nice list
of important people for him. In the "Traitors gallery of the human race"
section you can read about Bill Gates, Griff/Electronic Images, Adolf
Hitler and Phoenix/Vectronix among others and their abandons of mankind.

You'll find Faramirs homepage on this adress: http://faramir.enemy.org

Faramir also claims he's still a member of Elite, and I hope this is not as
big surprise to other Elite members as it was to me. Although I wonder what
the reason is for hiding Faramir as member, not listing him in NFO's or
official member lists. Is Elite in the leadership of Marcer cowards which
don't stand up to their actions or are they just afraid of how Vectronix
and other people would feel about this?

This is Faramirs own words about himself still being in Elite:

 "Marcer re-joined me into elite 2-3 weeks after that story upon my demand,
 as a trader and with conditions not to release unappropriate stuff under
 the elite banner again."

Seems like if you want to be a member of Elite you just have to _demand_
it, and promise to be nice.... ;-)


[4] System Overload: Elite's New Belgian Headquarter
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Elite's belgian headquarter have changed! Faramir got into conflicts with
the sysop of Pantheon BBS who was running PCBoard under Windows as BBS
software. The new BHQ is System Overload (+32-51/40.71.94) running the old
Amiga BBS program DayDream BBS now ported to Linux, 2 nodes 28k8 (sometimes
telnet). Check it out!


[5] Undercover Magazine Issue #9
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

UCM #9 was released on 6th of July, altough in a great hurry and not very
well thought it seems, without intro and the same old bugs still there. I
guess they just wanted to get the magazine out to all the people waiting
for it, and as old news is no news, for a magazine it makes sense.

UCM is now being produced as a co-operation between TNB and TSCC,
Moondog/TNB almost questions himself in the leadtext of the magazine as
wether UCM is a TNB or TSCC products this time.

The UCM shell doesn't wanna co-operate with my TT or the PacifiST emulator,
I also get reports it doesn't work very nice under Falcon VGA and issue
number 9 doesn't even work under plain ST's, there is also a screen which
doesn't work, so they included it in a textfile instead, ehhh!?

I wish for these incompability problems, and UCM's reputation there would
be an option to create an ascii version of the magazine like in Reality
Check Network among others, so people would be able to read it.

I also think the UCM team should get themself an official homepage carrying
the latest release and also an email address as nobody cares to use snail
mail these days.

Enough complaints, go find this otherwise so excellent magazine now!!!

Note: mOd/TSCC says there might be a re-release of issue 9 in everything
from a few days to a week or two, let's hope it will work this time!


[6] Atari 8-bit Collection
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zaphod Beeblebrox/Swedish Infomania (ex. I.C.S) and sysop of Eagles Nest
Private is compiling one hell of a Atari 8-bit CD collection. This CD will
kick the shit out of all previous Atari 8-bit archives you have ever seen.
Watch out for further information on this real nostalgica must have CD!


[7] PacifiST v0.46
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PacifiST, the great Atari ST emulator for PC is to be released in version
0.46 next week. PacifiST is a must for everyone who's got a PC and wants to
experience a real nostalgic trip!

Changes in the next version (0.46):

* Fixed GUS driver, ok with PnP's
* Fileselector changes: filenames shortcuts, RAR support, fixed multi-MSA
  extraction
* Better YM recording, replaying under monitor with start/end/loop settings
* STE Blitter emulation

For more information about PacifiST, check out the official homepage!
http://wwwperso.hol.fr/~gidouin/pacifist.html


[8] Pretty Good Privacy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latest version of the popular encryption program PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) has been exported to Europe, only a few days after its release in
the US. Because of the strict export regulations regarding strong
cryptographic software in the US, the program was not exported in
electronic form. Instead, the PGP 5.0 source code books, published by
Warthman Associates on June 14, have been shipped to Europe and work is now
going on to scan in all 12 volumes (over 6000 pages) using OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) techniques. Ståle Schumacher, author of the
International PGP Home Page, says that he hopes the program will become
available to PGP users worldwide by early July.

Read more about this, how far the scanning have come, and other interesting
subjects regarding Pretty Good Privacy on the International PGP Homepage:

[2] Central Data Going Down!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We must unfortunately announce that Central Data, the main ftp server is
going down. There is no problems with the law or anything, but simply to
the reason the owners university accounts are being closed down as he's no
longer attending the university.

We all knew the site was only for about a year when it was opened up, and
we knew this day would come but still it dropped down like a bomb for
everyone.

We would like to thank TMC for the excellent service he have provided
during this year. The Central Data FTP site have served the atari
underground scene well, and we'll all miss it!

[4] The Atari Scene in USA!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well as you all are very aware that the Atari scene is slowly dieing. You'd
be a fool to disagree (watch it Ryder, statements like that makes you a
traitor to the human race! /Phx). But then again you are allowed to your
own opinions. I'm just going on what I've seen happen in the last 2-3
years.

About 2 years ago Atari the Atari scene was still pretty healthy and there
was a massive user base but because of the lack Internet support at the
time people jumped to PC's as the Internet was now the cool place to go.
Sure people still held onto their beloved atari's, as most people do. As
the nostalgia of atari will never die.  I've never seen such a tight group
of platform support than I've seen in the atari realm. I guess when the
people at atari didn't seem to care about the users, the users banded
together to support one another. That's why we're here.. to help support
what's left of the atari user base. People are quick to scream "But your
killing what's left of the atari community by releasing cracks" But can you
honestly say that you've NEVER copied ANY ST software??

My scenerio for instance.. I would have left Atari years ago if it wasn't
for getting a hold of some useful cracked software that I would have never
paid the kinda money people want for them. One thing about atari users that
I have unfortunatly encountered is that their atari gear is like one of the
family and they won't let the stuff go cheap! Same thing with atari
vendors.. I needed a replacement DMA chip. $75US after shipping and taxes!!
I searched for about a month and found a used 1040STe/4meg for $80.  So go
figure.. the vendors charge almost more for a new chip them for a whole
used computer. No wonder they are going bankrupt! They are trying to make a
big profit quick rather then make bigger profits slowly. "If you sold stuff
cheaper you might sell more making a bigger return" <hint, hint!!>

Anyways.. Thanks for letting me vent! I'm just sick of people crying that
Atari is dieing because of people like us.. in reality we're keeping it
alive for alot of people.. I got proof.. Kinda ;-) Which brings me to Happy
Hideaway.. If you remeber the good old days, HH and STampede were a place
where all of us used to go and hang and do our trading.. Well HH's user
base had slowly started to dwindle abit because of the lack of programs for
the ST. Since becoming a Vex support bbs (USHQ) HH is starting to get
people back! Not near to where it was a few years ago, but then again there
is not half as many atari users as there was before.

HH is now run on a PC, but is STill catering to all the atarians far and
wide. and has a very active file/message base. Also mentions should go out
to Paybax. As you know they are a Vex distro bbs and also has a very active
file/message base. I regret to say that the US scene is very much not near
what it used to be. But we all can do our best and try to get it back to
where it is at least FUN again.

I have no idea what happened to STampede.. I heard it was up about a month
ago and I tried calling it and the number just rings and rings.. If you
have any info on the US atari scene please contact me at the address below.

*** Help support the US Atari scene!! ***

If you know of any Atari elite bbs or ftp's that would like to receive Vex
support please mail us at: vectronix@hotmail.com and we will get in touch
with you about the details. Or if you know any elite bbs phone numbers we
don't know about, send them to us at the address above.

Thanks

[5] Atari TOS Images
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vectronix brings you a selection of TOS inages to choose from, different
version all from TOS 1.0 to 2.06 in different nationalities. These images
are needed for the PacifiST emulator for example, and now people don't need
to ask anymore. More images will be up shortly, and you can find them on...

http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/9676/


[6] Heavens Trash Update
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heavens Trash BBS now features complete collections (with only a few
exceptions) of compact menus with the following groups:

Automation, Cynix, D-Bug, Delight, Deviant Designers, Flames of Finland,
Medway Boys, Pompey Pirates, Sewer Software and Superior.

As if this was not enough, the excellent CD compiled by Skinhead/ICS is
also online, featuring almost 1500 additional games for the good old atari.
So if there's an old game you cannot find here, it does not exist!

For long distant callers a telnet connection can be established while
Phoenix is online on the internet (which he is way too much). You will need
a telnet client supporting ANSI (VT-102) graphics and ZMODEM file transfer
protocol. I'm not aware of any telnet client for the atari which supports
this, there might be for MiNT, but I'm not sure.

Recommended telnet client for Win95/NT is CRT v2.x which can be found on
http://www.vandyke.com, do under NO circumstances use the one which comes
with Windows as it's not compatible with anything!

Heavens Trash BBS telnet address: trash.dyn.ml.org (not 24 hours!)


[7] Corrections about Elite
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was a few mistakes concerning Elite in the last issue of VEXNEWS, so
let's try to correct them here and now. We're very sorry for any
inconveniance this may have caused. We learned by the experience to never
trust ex-elite members though... ;-)

Faramir is NOT in Elite anymore, that is confirmed and totally clear now!
He continues his struggle against Microsoft and the aliens on his own, we
wishes Faramir good luck!

>Elite's belgian headquarter have changed! Faramir got into conflicts with
>the sysop of Pantheon BBS who was running PCBoard under Windows as BBS
>software. The new BHQ is System Overload (+32-51/40.71.94) running the old
>Amiga BBS program DayDream BBS now ported to Linux, 2 nodes 28k8
>(sometimes telnet). Check it out!

I would like to say that this is NOT true .. I still run the Elite BHQ. It
was Faramir's unjudtified idea to kick my BBS from it's position, and Elite
(Marcer) did NOT approved this decision

I would appreciate it if you corrected this news in your next newsletter
The elite bHq is: Pantheon BBS +32-27632250 (ringdown) I am currently still
running PCB (under Desqview) but am working on daydream for Linux too.. I
am sometimes on telnet and will be 24/24 soon (I hope, if my plan works
out:))

This decision from Faramir came, exactly as you said, cuz he disagreed with
me, cuz I have a PC conference (wich is doing well) and he couldn't stand
it that I don't let him delete windows files (we all know his attitude with
windows and stuff) ...

The funny thing is that _I_ told faramir about this other BBS, that it was
cool ... and then he turned his back on me ... thanks faramir .

cya ..
Sysop of Pantheon BBS

*** Last minute change ***

This was all very true, and at the time for the missunderstanding our
information was not official, I can understand why the sysop of Pantheon
wanted us to correct this. However, as there have been a few weeks since
the last VEXNEWS issue things have changed again in the Elite headquarters.
BOTH Pantheon and System Overload are now Belgian heaquarters for Elite,
and I hope everyone is satisfied now....

[4] Notes about the WWW site
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The WWW site announced in VEXNEWS #4 is _not_ accessable from CAB due to
it's limits and that it doesn't support the password protection. There was
no way around this unfortunately, and therefore CAB users must use the FTP
site instead until CAB get's updated.

There are a also number of sites that will permit public Lynx access via
telnet and a guest account, for those who _really_ want to use WWW.

sailor.lib.md.us (login as 'guest') ver. 2.7.1
public.sunsite.unc.edu (login as 'lynx') ver. 2.5
cwispub.unh.edu (login as 'cwispub') ver. 2.7
trfn.clpgh.org (login as 'trfn') ver. 2.6
lynx.cc.ukans.edu (login as 'lynx') ver. 2.5
philadelphia.libertynet.org (login as 'liberty' no password)


[5] Vectronix is the Number #1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vectronix would like to thank everyone who voted for us in the Undercover
Magazines voting chart. We are honoured by the first place and it
encourages us to continue supporting the atari scene. Thanx to everyone,
keep up the good work!

We'll see if there will be any more cracking charts in coming UCM issues
though as some people seems to think it does not belong in a scene
magazine. We think it's a weird point of view as without the underground
scene there would be no atari scene to speak about at all!

Maybe a cracking chart is not needed because there is not many active
groups left today, but that's a completely different story....

We are still honoured though, no matter what, and it feels great that you
guys are still trusting in us. Thank you all!
