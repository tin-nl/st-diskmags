-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello ppl! Do you  remember these  wonderful days  when you  spent a lot of the
time playing  River Ride  or other cool  games? Probably many of you guys think
now: Oh yes... Those were fantastic years... But it's in the past.
Yep, it's partly true, but have  you heard about the polish Atari scene? In our
country this  machine is still alive and going strong!!! It's amazing, but in a
few  computer shops in  Poland near the PC, PSX, N64 software you can find also
new games for 8-bit Atari too! Yep, it isn't joke!
At the Orneta  party this year  two firms (Sikor soft and Firebird) came along,
and were  selling new nice games for Atari XL/XE!. As  well as new software, on
sale  at  the  Orneta party  was the  2nd  issue  of  the "Syzygy", a newspaper
dedicated  for XL/XE  fans! (Of course it isn't  available in any shops, but it
exists!).
Today's  configurations  of  those 8 bit  machines  are _incredible_! It's  not
unusual in Poland to see XL/XE machines with the following upgrades:

- Covox (very easy sound card for PC)
- Sound Blaster sound card
- SID sound chip
- 1024kb of memory
- AT BUS hard drive (!!!)
- CD Rom (!!!!!!!!!)

This isn't  a poor joke, it's the _truth_ ! Not  only is  there this  fantastic
hardware, there is  much software about which uses these capabilities! It's not
unusual  these days, when  somebody makes  music modules on the XL/XE which you
can listen later on your ST or Falcon! :()
 
The  demo-scene on  this  machine  is fuckin' active! There  are about  18 demo
groups! The demos where you  could used  to see scrollers + picture etc. are in
the  past! Today's  demos look  more like Amiga stuff! What you can find in the 
XL/XE demos? How about:

- bumpmappings
- ENV toruses
- galaxy distorters 
- gouraud shading
- objects with textures + zooming + rotatation
- textured tunnels
- wolfenstein 3d-like effects 
  
... and much more brainblasting effects! 
 
So, finally, what can I say? Well, why not find  your old 8-bit Atari  and find
out what you've been missing all those years! 

Last note: This year we had no less than 4 (!!!) copy  parties for XL/XE users!
At the Orneta party 9 demos were  released (Including one  not entered into the
demos competition because it was unfinished) and 4 (!) intros! 
It's an excellent result, isn't it?
