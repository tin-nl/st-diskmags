Yep, it's [Î]ÓV!L¯s Ÿ0ù  again and today  I'm jumping  around on some  compacts
made by some english lamers called PULSE.
You ask me why I'm  jumping around  on them?! It's easy to say: I was really in
rage after I got them and wanted to look what stuff is included... because it's
all ZiP-packed! What  the hell has burned out  the brain of the makers of these
cd to pack games with ZiP on a compact-disk?! Argl, where are the good old days
of AUTOMATiON or the POMPEY PiRATES, FUZiON and the SYNDiCATE... and let me say
that even the compacts of TUMULT are lightyears better than this shit!
But let me start from the beginning.
It took a long time to receive  these disx and they're very old now. Don't know
if the band behind this menus is still alive, but  I don't hope so because with
this shit they don't help the scene to survive.
The menus I  want  to test  are 13, 14 and 15. The first  ones were released in
1996 and the last one in January this year.
Whot's on the disx: menu 13 - ARKANOID (cracked and fixed by VEX)
                              SQUARE OFF (full version, disk one)
                              WARP (cracked by SUPERiOR)
                              ZEBULAND BETA
                    menu 14 - AUTORENNEN
                              KLOMANAGER
                              SLUG
                              SQUARE OFF (full version, disk two)
                    menu 15 - BIG KART (falcon)
                              KAISER (cracked by VEX, disk one)
                              MADTRIS
                              ST ZiP 2.6
                              some other shit
As you can see  on the titles it's senseless to loose any words about them. The
only interesting thing is  SQUARE OFF, because it's a  Munsie-game. Yes, you're
right, the guys behind the crazy FRANTiCK and so one.
The other stuff? ARKANOiD? Is fixed  for the  Falcon, but horrible old. WARP is
a very  old THALiON-game, cracked and  trained by  JABBA of  SUPERiOR. ZEBULAND
is a fucking  dull GEM-game  from Czechoslovakia, AUTORENNEN, another  dumb PD-
game from Switzerland (btw. it seems as the programmer is the brother or son of
the guy behind the MEDUSA), SLUG a nice game (but was packed to a ST-USER cover
disk some years ago), KLOMANAGER another old PD-game from 1993, KAiSER  is also
horrible old, and last but not least MADTRiS and BiGKART are not worth any word
old, older and oldest stuff!
But now. In  former times  it was normal  that you had startable games on a CD,
and if the crackers were very skilled they packed  games with more disx to only
one disk and you must not change the disx or so. But what made the guys of this
band? They're  ZiPping the whole  stuff. Fuck! It's  fucking dull to depack the
stuff  before playing  around! But  for me it leaves at  least one good  thing:
after depacking the stuff I need  I can DELETE this fucking lame menus and so I
get my disx back.
Some last  words about the  intros: the first  one was  original, at least they
said this. The second was a ripp-off  of an old TUMULT-intro  and the third the
always known lame scroller+picture stuff, as the most UK-compilation-bands used
also in  the past (like the  losers of SERENADE, IMPACT UK, GOLDEN DAWN and  so
one...). Perhaps it's also  ripped stuff, at least  it seems that they're using
source from other coders without mention this and THIS IS LAME!
So, you dumb freax  from PULSE. If you will ever read this, so try to make REAL
menus, with startable AND packed games or go away!
Conclusion: this disx are  not even usefull for compact-collectors, just delete
            the shit after you've copied the stuff you needed from the disx!
