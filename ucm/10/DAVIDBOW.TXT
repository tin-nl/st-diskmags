
                             my winter  searches
                              my coldness needs
                                my sun shines
                                my night lies
                             my spring will come

                         my winter is  searching you
                            my coldness needs you
                              my sun is shining
                              my night is lying
                             my spring will come

              my winter is searching  you now that you are gone
                    my coldness doesn't  need you anymore
                        my suns don't  shine for long
                       my night lies in snow and frost
                             my spring will come
                             my spring will come
                                 will become
                                 your winter

ObjeCt: DAVID BOWIE DEMO
pOSsEE: EFFECT
nEeEdZ: ATARI ST/E (2 MEG), 2 DISKS

===============================================================================


Welcome fellow demoheadz to another review of what 1997 has brought to us. This
time we  speak about the "DAVID BOWIE DEMO" by SINBAD of EFFECT from the island
where the  rain never ends - Great BRITAIN. Last time when I reviewed a demo by
this guy I was really rough with his effort.

Ok. Let's forget the past and see what we have here. I put the disk in my drive
and waited what  is going to happen. First there appeared a face by David Bowie
(who else?) and some text saying 'David Bowie demo by Sinbad of Effect'.
The  demo was  released  on  February the  23rd  and it  requires  a 2 megabyte
machine. So  you wonder why we  review it that  late? That's  an easy  one. The
dataflow between the island and the rest of europe doesn't seem to be that good
anymore and not everything can be found on the net.
Allright let's  go on. So, what  else has this  demo in common? There are lotsa
pictures by  David Bowie and sampled music from David Bowie! What else should I
tell you about  this? There is nothing  more! The whole thing comes on 2 disks.
So you have to decide if you want to keep it.
It is only interesting for you if you are a real David Bowie fan.



ViSuALz:    50% - scanned gfx converted from the PC

auDiO:      40% - sampled music from DB. not in the best quality.

c0olNesS:   20% - the days for such demos are counted. simply too late for 97.
