                        Shareware, The New Generation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shareware utilities and games should change a bit.

For example  why not  for example, give  all ppl the  full versions  and if the
users likes it, pays for it. Then they get the manual or something.
Kind of a full preview  of the stuff. For  some years it should never work, but
in these  days. Atari scene  has slowed  down alot, no  one thinks  there is no
releases, hard  to get etc etc. they  only find some demos  of games and utils,
which actually never  will be finished. They just give up for it. So this might
be n solution of some more hope for Atari scene and believe!

PC, the death of homecomputers. It  is the future, nothing more to tell. But is
this computer really what we want?? Do we need it? What is the sport?
Demos: They looks like movies, well  you should buy an Pentium 200Mhz to get it
work softly.. where is the sport?

Games: nice, cool  effects. Doom 1  works on P-90, Quake  P-150, Hmm.. where is
the sport???

Utilitys: normaly  shouldn't use more than 5mb. AT least 10-100Mb for an fakkin
screen saver  or file selector (bad  examples but you  know what I mean). Argh!
What is this??

BLAH!!

So, don't  stop of believing  Atari, try to  figure out something, open up your
nostalgy trips & imaginations. What could I do with this CPU? Contiune to break
its walls!! Here you  find the sport!! So  why not start to write an shareware,
if  you make  it good  you  will  notice by  donations! People  who  likes  and
understand  Ataris situation  will pay  for the manual! But  they won't pay for
something which they don't know if it will be released.
So release full versions of sharewarez!

Could even be the death of hacker/crackers!
If you give  out the full  versions. Why  hack it? Fun, well  yeah but it won't
bother the author, coz the user still might want the manual. Think about it.

In some  shareware games  I have notice  pretty good coding. But  the GFX suxx.
Why don't you search  around for an GFX man for this kind of job. It's not only
the good coding wich make the game!

Do as you want, and don't make other rule over you!
You could always listen, but you don't need to act!
