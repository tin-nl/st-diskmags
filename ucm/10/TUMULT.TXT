Hiya! [Î]ÓV!L¯s Ÿ0ù is writing some sh!t for you again!

I thought  I must write a  little bit more  as only one l00sy  article for each
issue, and here we go, with a critical look on the latest compact menus by...

I think the most of you have seen some of their compacts so far and I think I'm
right when I say that also you own a lot of their disx, eh?!
Now I have  here the 3 latest disx  and I'm a bit disturbed. Ok, there is a new
intro on the  disx, but it's used three times again. On the other hand you have
only oooould stuff. On each disk you will find one (horrible old) game and lots
of patches and  keymakers to fill up  the disk-space. Perhaps  you like them, I
think it's shit to pack games from 1990 to a disk in the year of 1997.
So I will give you a short overview about the stuff on the single compacts:

TUMULT MENU 12 ... PRINCE OF PERSIA one disk version hacked by TUMULT
                   STRANGE WAR patch file by VEX
                   COMA v4.0.0 KEY CREATOR v1.0 done by ELiTE
TUMULT MENU 13 ... DEFENDER OF THE CROWN cracked and STe/Fo3o fixed by VEX
                   MAGIC QUEST HACKFILE done by ELiTE
                   ROUTE FINDER 2 KEY CREATOR done by ELiTE
TUMULT MENU 14 ... WINGS OF DEATH one disk version by EAST GERMAN CRACKING CREW
                   LEDKEY v1.34 done by ELiTE
                   SIGMA v1.00 REGISTRATION CODE done by ELiTE
                   SWIFTEL III REGISTRATION KEY done by ELiTE
                   CONNECT PATCH v1.3 done by LETHAL WEAPONS

As you can see, it's not the  hotest stuff. The  games are nice  and I searched
for long  times for  PR!NCE OF PERS!A. I have  played  it on my AMiGA in former
times the whole night through and also on my PC. But I've sold the AMiGA and as
I've bought a new sound-card the game won't run  anymore on the PC, sniff. So I
was very happy to get a new running version.
Hmmm. DEFENDER OF THE CROWN I always have another crack and don't need the F030
patch, so it's useless for me. Anyway it's a nice old game.
WiNGS OF DEATH, needless to  mention that this  is one of the  best games on ST
ever made, it's  just a Thalion-release. But  it doesn't  run from the menu and
you must start it from  the desktop. And  last but not  least I always  have it
for about 4 years.
I will not loose any words about  the patches because I don't need them and the
CONNECT PATCH is  a dumb joke, horrible old and  the coder  called "MAVERICK of
the LETHAL WEAPONS" (what  a shitty pseudonym) is talking  about illegal and so
one in the readme file, for what he wrote this shit?! Fuck off!
By the way. The  guys of TuMuLT have  started to slagg off a load of other guys
from the scene, like the creeps of PuLSE, a guy called RAMSESS, ORBY and JOA at
one time (hehehe, it's  a fucking stupid idea  to use three  different names as
cracker, esp. the name of the girlfriend... but don't  forget, there  are a lot
of other freax around using  ten different names  for ten different groups) and
a guy  called THE BYTE of TCE. I like  this kind of stuff, hehe. It remembers a
little bit to the good old times of the slagg-wars between ANiMAL MiNE and DNS,
IMPACT FRANCE  and FUZ!0N, the times  of F.A.L.L. and  so one. Great  and funny
times, don't you think?!
But there are still some  questions left, who are these guys from TuMuLT?! They
say they are  from Denmark. I don't believe this. Also the thing with the line-
up is a bit strange, everytime  there are some  new members or they have simply
changed their name. Don't know...
For me is only one thing safe, they  have to made very big steps to reach their
big idols, the POMPEY PiRATES. Not  only that WoD won't run from the  menu, no,
the intro of menu 12 bombs away. Don't  know why, perhaps  they can't deal with
the SPEEDPACKER by  the FIREHAWKS. BTW. a real "ELITE"-team codes his own pack-
routines and don't uses old  and not very safe packers. But it seems that there
is anyway only one  active member  in this band. Why  should they  use the same
intro very often, only with some little changes, like other sprite curves etc?
So  there isn't a  big step  between  them and those  lamers like  PULSE or the
ANCiENT CELTS, at least for me.
It's time to end this review. The intro(s) is original and contains a nice logo
by a  guy called SPK of MiDGARD (What  the hell?!), not  like the  ripped stuff
from these fucking lame  UK bands. But therefore  you can kick the stuff on the
disx in the trashcan. For  the one or other  collector it could be interesting,
but I need some  new stuff for playing  around and it's a dumb thing in my eyes
to release  old stuff instead waiting for  hot and fresh games. But no one will
hear my voice, the voice of the underground... hehe, greetings to MAD VISION!
Last but not least a little message to DRUiD of TuMuLT: Yep, dickhead, you want
to be fucked?! You get fucked, right now! It's very easy for me to do it, becoz
you're only an old bitch, no  dong somewhere, only a juicy cunt for me! Come on
and I will give you a phat load!
Btw, you want get in touch with me? Try to find me at your LiDL market, hehe...
