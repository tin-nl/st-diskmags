                             "MAKE UP YOUR MIND"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

studio/live-EP, Hedgehog Music / Polydor 1996

Today I  will review another  piece of music  for you and  this time it's irish
speed folk made in Germany, strange, eh?
I think many people have heard of this band, at  least here in Germany, because
they were  present at many open air festivals  in the last years and with their
cool music they're real great party-makers.
This little EP contains only 7 tracks and  runs only a half hour. It's a mix of
new  studio-tracks and some  live-recordings. You will find the following stuff
on it:

contents

1. Make Up Your Mind                (studio)
2. New Temptation                   (studio)
3. Into The Darkness                (studio)
4. Don't Turn Away                  (live)
5. Shamrock Busker                  (live)
6. I Won't Follow You Up To Carlow  (live)
7. Midnight Rambler                 (live)

Hum. I for myself was a bit disappointed  from this EP, because at their gig at
the Zillo-Festival they were  much more powerful and faster and over all also a
bit more impressive. This EP features mostly  slow songs and  my favourite (the
only one I really like) is the third  one. The others aren't bad, no  question,
but I miss the real Fiddler's-vibe. They're rippling into the one ear and leave
the  other one  without leaving  any memory. We use the  word "austauschbar" in
Germany when we hear music which doesn't impress enough to remember to the band
who had made  it... and this is the fact at this EP... in english: exchangeable
or so... =)  If you don't know  the Fiddler's you  should not buy this album to
get an impression of their work, it's only useful for iron fans...

Make Up Your Mind
-----------------

A lonely evening settles down
There's no escape here, cause now I drown
In all that memories that float inside
And keep me burning
A raging chaos in my head
I throw my blanket from my bed
There ain't no rest and there ain't no peace
I'm thinking about you.

The burnt-out end of a smokey day
I have to go now cannot stay
I'm trying hard not to lose my way
That takes me backwards

Make up your mind don't keep me burning
I'm trying so hard not to gain ground
Make up your mind don't keep me yearning
I'm down on my knees

It could be heaven could be hell
But she's in doubt and she cannot tell
If we're together or apart, no final answer
And now I'm staring at the phone
Time is frozen, I'm on my own
I'm sitting here completely paralyzed
I'm in slow motion

Do you remember the time
When our hearts could fly
Stretching our souls across the wide wide sky
Myself and my soul they were the very best friends
Bu now they're apart and never shake their hands

This is an SOS...

New Temptation
--------------

Pretty babe you're burning bright
Down in the dancehalls of the night
I wonder what she's gonna do
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry
I wonder but haven't got a clue

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of your eyes
So tell me, tell me where you go
And what shoulder and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart
Good or evil we will never know

She is my new temptation
My latest inspiration
The incarnation of a fairy queen
She is my new temptation
My latest inspiration
And she will always be
Shining in my phantasy

What the hammer what the chain
In what furnace way thy brain
I wonder where you're coming from
Babe I die in agony
You are his latest symphony
Release me, but don't get me wrong

I wonder where she goes, I wonder where she's been
I wonder where she goes, I wonder where she's been

And when the stars threw down their spears
And watered heaven with his tears
Did he smile when he did see his work
She shakes her **** every night,
I'd like to touch here, hold her tight
Good or evil we will never know

Into The Darkness
-----------------

Summer rain was falling
And gave a promise of life
We felt the water on our skin
But then the light grew dim
And in the flickering twilight
We felt the shadow of fear
Cause we both knew
That our days were counted
No more time here

She bid me take life easy
As the leaves that grow on every tree
But I was young and foolish
With her would not agree

The wind blows right into my face
And wraps the pain
But something that tells me
That nothing, nothing's in vain

She's gone into the darkness
Gone into the darkness
Gone into the darkness
Gone into the darkness

And in my head there's a fire
That's still burning for you
An unforgotten desire
That sometimes breaking through
And then the noise of the people
Cannot reach my ear
Cause there's a certain silence
Where we both meet

The lyrics of the live-tracks  weren't printed in the booklet and you will find
them for sure in one of the older album of the band.
That's all folks and folk-fans! Perhaps see ya on a Fiddler's concert with much
more impressive stuff as recorded for this EP...
BTW. For all who want to see  the FIDDLER'S live here comes a short overview of
their tour for this year... from middle of November... (the price about 20 DM)

This list will be  updated every three weeks and you can get the latest list on
their concerts. I think it's better to go to  one of their gigs  instead buying
an album because their music  is live performed  much better  and you will jump
around after a few minutes. I have  seen them  in  the "Wartesaal" of  the Easy
Schorre in Halle (24.10.) and  even if this was only a very small room it was a
crazy concert and I can feel all of my bones today...
