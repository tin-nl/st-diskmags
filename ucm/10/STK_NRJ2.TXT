ObjeCt: NRJ FOR YOU 2
pOSsEE: ST KNIGHTS
nEeEdZ: ATARI STE, 2 DISKS

===============================================================================

We are here to judge about the NRJ FOR YOU 2 Demo by the ST KNIGHTS. At first I
want to say that it is only a music demo and so you cannot await world records.
After some  loading a little  presentation-screen apears which says 'ST KNIGHTS
present - NRJ  for  you 2'. The  demo was  already  started  back in  1992  for
Hemoroids/Fuzion and  was finished  in december 1996 (oh  my god you cry, again
such a late review...).

After pressing  space some music and  a Fuzion-Logo comes up. Next to this logo
follows a Hemoroids-logo.
Then there is  a nice drawn manga-girl  and simultanously to the music the girl
twinkles her  eyes. Nice. Right  after this you come to the menu. There is some
scrolltext telling you all the secrets that you ever wanted to know.
By pressing help you get some menu where you can choose one of the nine modules
which go  by the names  of: Principles, Sound  of  me, Long  song, Jean claude,
Reggea, Alan's belief, century, Vegas two and Phil remix.

All the modules  are in some typical  old-school amiga  style and they are very
nice. All modules  are made by STK themselves. Alan Parker did most of the work
I think. My  fave one  is the Phil remix, which  is some remix from 'In the air
tonight' by Phil Collins. Great. When you leave the demo some picture featuring
MAD MAX appears saying 'MAD MAX SAYS WOW!'.
CooL. That's really OLD SCHOOL!



ViSuALz:    80% - not many gfx but nicely hand-drawn and selfmade!

auDiO:      90% - good quality, mostly own compositions

c0olNesS:   70% - all done in ASM, Mad Mad says WOW bonus :-)
