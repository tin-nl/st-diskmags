...some days  ago I received a letter  from a guy living in the western part of
Germany. Nothing  special  so  far. But  the  reason  for  his  mail  was  very
interesting: about  one year ago I did a title-picture  for a German PC-diskmag
called "CREAM". This  issue was released in February this year and presented my
logo right in  front of the mag. So I was kind of astonished when that guy told
me that  he got the  mag, saw my "outstanding" graphics (they  weren't, indeed)
and asked me how to paint such stuff. His questions in detail were:

                a) how do I "dither"?
                b) how to paint "light" and "shadow"?
                c) where I get the shapes of the logos from?
                d) what are the steps when painting a logo?

So I wrote him a long letter - in German - and, because that guy also sent some
PC-stuff on the  disk, I went to the main editor of the CREAM-magazine, just to
give him  the stuff and  tell him about that  reaction to my gfx. When I talked
about that _really_ long letter, he  asked my why I do not write an aRt fACtORy
about  the same  themes. I  thought a  bit about that  and finally I decided to
write it, so here it is.

I think  it's pretty important  that anyone of the  few graphicians left in the
scene is telling  all the others "how" to paint, else nobody would learn it. So
This article should inspire and motivate all _these_ guys who want to paint but
do not  have the  idea of  the "how". I realized  that the  graphical level  of
productions  on the atARi decreased  over the  last years. This  is truely sad,
because  there is _more_ to  do than  the things  that are  already done. C'mon
guys, it is not _that_ hard to draw anything.
At least my  full respect to the people that are still doing gfx for the atARi.
(esp. agent -t-(maybe the best on atARi) and  the graphicians  of the RESERVOIR
DOGS (I'd really  like to have contact  with you! Please  write me!). I am also
interested in contacts to Polish graphicians, so if there are any, write me!)

This article is divided into the following points:

    a) general information
    b) the shapes of a logo
    c) color, light and shadow - let's add some realistic structures



a) GENERAL INFORMATION


- Which program should I use?

  Well, that may  depend on the program  you used when you started painting. On
  ST there were two "big" sorts of  gfx-programs: the ones with a Degas-zoom (a
  still  magnify; "Degas", "CrackArt")  and  the  ones  with  a  Neochrome-zoom
  (realtime  magnify; "NeoChrome", "Deluxe Paint"). Nowadays there  are lots of
  graphics tools on Falcon, but only a few are _really_ handable in working.
  Worth mentioning is IndyPaint 1.7, GodPaint and EscapePaint. I myself  prefer
  EscPaint. It uses a Degas-zoom, Truecolor with kind of plane-option and shows
  that  the coder  does  know what  graphicians  like. At  last you  should try
  painting something  with all programs, and  I'm sure that  you will recognize
  that EscPaint beats the shit out of the rest.


- How long does it take to paint a logo on computer, esp. mOd's?

  Some years ago I thought I had to start up with a logo and finish it the same
  day. So I did, but  that was a big mistake. As every work, also graphics need
  some  time to  mature. So do not  rush things, you  have all the  time in the
  world. Never think you have to paint logos within one day. The result is shit
  in most  cases. If you're not motivated or inspired, don't work on your logo,
  or, as I do it, only  antialias the edges of it. So you don't spoil the image
  in your uninspireded phase, but you do some work that has to be done and does
  not need any artistic temper.
  The logos I've drawn in the last year mainly took me some 2-3 weeks, with 1-2
  hours  of painting  every second day. I  think only that way you get the best
  results.


- What kind of equipment should I use?

  Please use  a RGB- or VGA-monitor. Anything else, esp. TV-sets are shit, even
  if you  use the SCART-input. I experienced  it several times that you don not
  see pixels  on TV-sets. And that's bad. Okay, I  have to admit that most RGB-
  monitors (I use  an aMiGA 1081 myself) do  not show you pixels, too, but they
  are still better than TV screens. Best monitor is a VGA screen, for sure.
  Beginners  may be a  bit frightened  by its "uprightness" - it  will show you
  _all_ the mistakes you made, any wrong pixel  will be uncovered - but you can
  be sure  that anything  you've drawn  looking good  on VGA will  look good on
  every other monitor.
  Trash your atARi-mouse. Use a high-quality mouse  with 400 dpi. Anything else
  sucks. (Hmm, if I remember right, agent -t- used a simple atARi-mouse. Baaah,
  just check out the mouses' effect to his fingers! Awful. ;))



b) THE SHAPES OF A LOGO, every step explained here...

   1.) If you  want to draw  something "big", a  logo that  uses more than only
       colors, you should always do  a sketch of it  before. This is  maybe the
       most important point in painting a logo, because you should  not deviate
       from the original sketch later.

       PLEASE TAKE SOME TIME IN DESIGNING THE SHAPES!

       When someone tells me to do  a special logo, I  have a first  idea in my
       mind in the  same moment. But  I do _not_ draw it on  paper, I design it
       more and more in my brain. This  phase often  takes 1 1/2 week. The best
       ideas come  into existence  while walking  through the city  or going by
       tram. I  DO NOT sit  down an  afternoon with the  task to think  out the
       shapes of a logo, that is totaly crap and you shouldn't do this, too.


   2.) When the outlines of the logo are ready  in my head, I take  a checkered
       piece of paper and draw  the logo on it  with a pencil. The  pencil must
       have a hard lead, so you can also draw thin lines.


   3.) Now  it is  time to  turn on  your computer  and  loading your favourite
       graphics-software.


   4.) The first thing is to prepare a special color-palette  for your picture.
       I mainly  turn _all_ colors to  black, only color  15 (the color that is
       far right in the palette) is white and color 14 is in a dark red.


   5.) After that you should draw two _lines_ with the red color. Those must be
       horizontal, from x-pos 0 to x-pos 320. These lines will be the upper and
       the lower border for you logo. So...

       0                                                  320


       Later, when  drawing the  picture, you must  draw the  logo within  this
       lines. So  please choose  the room  between the  two lines  wisely. I've
       experienced that lines that are  maybe 10 pixels too far  positioned may
       have a  bad effect on the  whole logo, which  will become too  big in x-
       range. Just look at my UnderCover 8-logo in the intro of that mag. :()


   6.) Well, the next step is kind of  simple: just take your  paper-sketch and
       convert it to the screen. This may be pretty hard when you're doing this
       for the first time, but don't by  scared, it will  work better  than you
       think!! Firstly, go into the zoom option of the program.
       I start in the upper left corner of the  logo, drawing the  edges of the
       _first_ letter to the screen.

       pRactiCAl hiNt: - use the lowest zoom-mode when drawing _long_ lines
                       - use a high zoom-mode for _short_ lines

       And please, do NOT use the first  line you've drawn! Make  several tries
       and choose the best of those. I make up  to 20 tries, always delete them
       by UNDO again and start  anew. People watching you  doing this will be a
       bit astonished about your working-steps (Hi! Dynacore and Scy;), but the
       letters will look better! For sure. Believe mOd. ;)


   7.) But  these lines  will look  shit. I know  that. They  will be  edgy and
       sometimes not even smooth. I guess it will look like this:


      y
       |
       |
       |     oooooo
       |          ooo
       |            oooooooooo
       |                     ooooo
       |                         ooo
       |                           oo
       |                             o
       |
       |
       |
       +-------------------------------------------------- x
       0                                                  320

       When it should look like this:

      y
       |
       |
       |   ( oooooo
       | l :       ooooo -----> one so called "little" line
       | i |            oooo
       | n-|                ooo
       | e |                   ooo
       |   :                      oo
       |   (_                       o
       |
       |
       |
       +-------------------------------------------------- x
       0                                                  320

       But there's  a simple  trick to  smooth a  line. Just look  at  the line
       above. As you  can  see, every "little" line  in  y-range+1 is one pixel
       longer then the "little" line below.

         6 pixels
         |      5 pixels
       oooooo   |   4 pixels
             ooooo  |  3 pixels
                  oooo |  2 pixels
                      ooo |1 pixel
                         oo|
                           o

       If you always  remember  this, your lines  will _always_ be  smooth. But
       sometimes you'll have to draw a line that has an other bend and not such
       an "straight" x^2 as  above. Then  you have to  interpolate  the line by
       your wishes, just like that:

         6 pixels
         |    4 pixels interpolation
       oooooo |    5 pixels           As  you  might  see, I  only did  another
             oooo  |   4 pixel ip     "little" line  between two  of the  curve
                 ooooo |   etc        shown above. This is pretty easy and does
                      oooo  |         not need  any further  explanations, am I
                          ooooo       right?
                               ooo
                                  oooo
                                      ooo
                                         oo
                                           o
                                            oo
                                              o

       Okay, when you finished drawing  all letters of your paper-sketch to the
       screen, check out the edges and the whole design of the logo again.
       Could it become a bit smoother in some places? Would it look freakier if
       you change one line of a letter a bit? Please try  and play a bit around
       with it. In  the end, erase all  rests of the red  lines you've drawn in
       the beginning.


   8.) Okay, the outline is ready. Congratulations! Now: backup that picture to
       a special disk and do not change it _anymore_. There are two reasons for
       that: when  the  colorization of the  picture isn't very  good, you  can
       always  start  with the  outline  again. And it is  also very  cool when
       you've finished the whole  logo to load the  final logo and  the outline
       version on two different screens  and watch the differences. At  least I
       like that. ;)



c) COLOR, LIGHT AND SHADOW

   1.) COLOR
       I have to admit that it is really hard to make a  good color-palette. So
       my hint is to use the color  pre-sets of  CrackArt if you're  not _that_
       experienced. Just  enter  the palette-function  in CrackArt  by pressing
       SPACE on the workscreen. Then choose a  palette with F1-F10 or SHIFT F1-
       F10. Some of the  palettes are not  very handy to  use. Always  check if
       there  are at  least  2 or 3  colors in  the palette which  are - in the
       color-intensity - between the background of the picture (mainly black, I
       guess) and the darkest color you use as fill-in of the logo.
       That's really  important for a  step that  will be  explained  somewhere
       below in this text: antialiasing, anti-alias, smoothing  or whatever you
       may call it.
       I experienced you'll get the best results when you use only _blue_, only
       _orange_ or  only _green_ colors. 16  colors  are  not much, so  why not
       using all of them for a green- or blue-range. Again: check out that not-
       so-cool-but-good-enough-for-this-text UnderCover 8-logo by me.


   2.) COLORIZATION OF THE WHOLE LOGO
       Very hard to give any hints at this  point. Just paint some  interesting
       textures  into  the  outline. It's  not  possible  to  explain "how to",
       because it is work  of heart now, not  of mind. (I hope you  know what I
       mean)


   3.) LIGHT
       ...makes your logo look  more realistic. For  painting lights  into your
       logo, you should have some experience with real life objects and how the
       light is reflected on and effects to  them. So it will be  again hard to
       explain, but I will try to.

       Firstly you  should  think of  the direction  from where the  light will
       shine onto your logo. I prefer up left, dunno why. So how  will a simple
       object look like when there's light on it? (that's my method and I don't
       know if it is really correct, but it looks quite okay)

       For 16 color logos I take 4 or 5 colors that are brighter  than the rest
       of the logos' fill-in. I  start with the  brightest of  these colors and
       draw the above as "*" marked points with a line of 1-2 pixel width. Then
       I antialias this line...and voila: you've got a nice light on your logo.
       Okay, that was really short explained, but my English is too bad to tell
       it to you more detailed.

       Hmm, but what the hell is antialiasing? Well, I'll try to explain!


   4.) ANTIALIASING, BLURING, ANTI-ALIAS, SMOOTHING OR WHATEVERYOUMIGHTCALLIT

       Antialiasing (don't know why it is called like this) means to smooth the
       edges of  you drawn  objects. This is  important because  anything drawn
       without  antialias  will  look  blocky  and shit. Just  check it  out by
       drawing a free-hand object to the screen. Now fill it with white color.
       The edges look horrible, right? But there's a chance to  obliterate this
       effect.


       ****************                         This  is  the  object  we  will
       ***********************    <------------ antialias now. As  you can see,
       **************************               its edges are not very smooth.
       ****************************            /
       *****************************         !/_
       ***********************************
       **************************************
       ***************************************

       Now calculate a color range between the  background color  and the color
       of the object. You should get at  least two color-steps  between them. I
       mainly use 4 colors for antialiasing.


       *************************
       *************************
       *************************
                           *  * *****************       This is a  zoom of  the
                           *  * *****************       object's outline.
                           *  * *****************
                                            *  * **********
                Inside of the object.       *  * **********
                White of coz.               *  * **********
                                                      *  * *****
                                                      *  * *****
                                                      *  * *****


       Begin with the  antialias-color that is the nearest  to the color of the
       object. Draw a line of 2-3 pixels width to the 1st "pixel-step". (="1")


       ************************111
       ************************111                     "1" is $666 or $555.
       ************************111                             (RGB)
                           *  * ****************11
                           *  * ****************11
                           *  * ****************11
                                            *  * ********11
                Inside of the object.       *  * ********11
                White of coz.               *  * ********11
                                                      *  * ****1
                                                      *  * ****1
                                                      *  * ****1


       And now the next color. It must be darker than "1". (="2")

       ************************111222
       ************************111222                  "2" is $444 or $333.
       ************************111222                          (RGB)
                           *  * ****************1122
                           *  * ****************1122
                           *  * ****************1122
                                            *  * ********112
                Inside of the object.       *  * ********112
                White of coz.               *  * ********112
                                                      *  * ****12
                                                      *  * ****12
                                                      *  * ****12


       And so on 'til the whole step  is antialised  away. (the last antialias-
       color should be $111 or something like that ($101, $10, $11)

       ************************11122233334445555

                           *  * ****************112234455
                                            *  * ********112345
                Inside of the object.       *  * ********112345
                White of coz.               *  * ********112345
                                                      *  * ****1245
                                                      *  * ****1245
                                                      *  * ****1245

       Okay, this zoom is antialiased. Let's take a look to our object from the
       beginning. It is antialiased now, too.


       ****************123455
       **********************1345
       *************************135
       ***************************135

Alright, I think that's enough for this aRt fACtORy. I  hope you liked the tips
I gave  you. If  you  are  really  interested  in  drawing, do  not  lose  your
motivation when the first things you paint  look not as good as they should do.
Practice  ever day! Then you  will get more and more experience. You will _not_
change from one day to the other  and become a good  graphician. Take  time for
practicing! (I myself learned for about five years now...)
