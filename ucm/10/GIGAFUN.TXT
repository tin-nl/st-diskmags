
		reaching through the ages
		a journey of timeless tracks
		and on history's horizon
		opens TERRA X
		
		the traces of places we never explored
		dark mysteries entombed in the past
		no word from the pharaohs for 3000 years
		Atlantis ascending at last
		
		instead of the answer we just know the question
		unidentified objects of earth and ocean
		present and past melting far in the future
		phenomena crystalize thoughts in slow motion
		
		a fingerprint in the dust of cultures
		and magical mysteries left behind
		in some seconds of life you see centuries living
		small steps for a man
		but so large for mankind

Well it  was about  8'o clock in  the evening  when we  left our  homeplanet to 
attend  another  one  of those  funny gatherings  of survivors  of the  ancient 
computing times. 
After 1 hour  we arrived at  the partyplace on the planet FRANCE, to be precise 
OFFENDORF which is a  little village near STRASSBOURG. I was very interested in 
how many guys  will be there this year. Last year there were only about 40 guys 
but anyway it was a nice event. 
In the beginning we had problems to get a parking place because there were more 
cars than  we had expected! We  entered the hall and... yes... there were lotsa 
more guys than  last year. At least it seemed so :-) First we met two guys from 
THERAPY, ESCAPE and SOLUTION SOFTWARE (the only germans...). Surprisingly there 
were lots of Atari machines present!

'Kraft durch Ficken' was  the  last  sentence  I  can  remember  from  the last 
Gigafun. Those  nasty guys  from Absence wrote it on a big paper wall where all 
the groups wrote their names on! Groups that I have recognized are: ADRENALINE, 
TYPHOON, POPSY  TEAM, CENTEK, SECTOR  ONE, TRISOMIC DEVELOPEMENT, EXA, IRIDIUM, 
STRATOS  MAGAZINE,  ATROCITY,  THERAPY, ESCAPE,  SOLUTION  SOFTWARE, .tSCc. (of 
course) and some Amiga and PC guys. 

Well at first I met my swapping mate THE BEAST/Typhoon who copied me the latest 
release of the TOXIC MAGAZINE which is number 13! It was released at the party. 
There was  also a  realtime-article  at the  party which  will be released with 
TOXIC MAG 14! 
The Beast had  prepared a harddisc  for the  HD-Throwing competition!!! I don't 
know if  this compo took place  but it was a really  cool idea! Right beside us 
some  frenchies  made a  SAMPLE-BATTLE! They  played different  samples (french 
funny stuff I think) to force the other side to give up! :-)

On  Saturday  evening  the guys  from CENTEK presented  their new  Falcon-clone 
called PHENIX and their turbocards. That was really cool because another french 
guy (ZIGO/EXA) tried  to  translate  the  presentation  into  english for those 
handfull of germans. The main presentator was always to fast and so ZIGO had to 
stop him to translate all the stuff that was told.
They  also presented  the new game  by EXA running  on a Falcon with a Centurbo 
card! It's  a Mario-Kart-clone  which  looks  really  cool. The  game  will  be 
released around October this year.

Most of  the time I was  very tired because I slept very bad the 2 nights and I 
was not really in the mood for party, because I have worked all the week before 
and I had  to work all  the week after the party, so weekend was short and that 
sucked. We left the party on sunday at around 14'o clock.
Now it  is monday  evening  and  the  party  is  still  going  on. I  think the 
competitions  will held right now. I'm sure you will find the results elsewhere 
in this mag! I only know one competition result at the moment.
The organisers  gave some  musicians a package  of special (shitty) samples and 
they had  to create a  module. The first place was made by SCY of .tSCc. with a 
module  called NOISE! Ha! What  a good laugh we had when we heard this! I asked 
Scy why he has  choosen such a normal name  for his mod and he said that he had
not thought about a name but next time he will chose OMELETTE DU FROMAGE!! 
(That's an .tSCc.-internal joke! Watch Dexter's Laboratory on Cartoon Network!)

I have  to admit  that this  article does'nt  give a real  insight  in what was 
happening on the party  but I was really knackered most of the time and so this 
is only a fragment... of a hologram rose.
