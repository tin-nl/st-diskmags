                    IS THERE STILL A ST SCENE IN FRANCE???
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ok now some news about the few active bands on ST in France. Unlike most of
my fellows  I won't tell  you much  about the sleeping bands, only mention that
some  bands such  as ACCS, Atrocity or Dune  among others are for sure inactive
and won't change status! 

    You will even be able to get in touch with them as addresses and emails are
enclosed in this file.


    ATROCITY :
    --------
    No don't worry I'm not changing my mind! I'd just like to say that there is
a debugged version of the demo "A l'Aube du Matin du soir 2". This  fixed stuff
was made by SENIOR DADS who also added a nice intro and extro... quite special.

    Contact : this demo can be downloaded from the demo section at
    πππππππ   http://grelb.src.gla.ac.uk:8000/~mjames/computers
              (really great site with load of links !!!)


    CEREBRAL VORTEX :
    ---------------
    HYLST, the only  really active  member, seems to be stucked with his huge 5
disks  JAPMO. Due  to be  shown at last  summer's  Gigafun, the  demo  has been
delayed to an unknown date...

    Contact : sorry no email or site known only snail-mail address
    πππππππ   HYLST aka Geoffroy STREIT
              7 rue Elsberg
              67530 OTTROT (FRANCE of course)


    NO LIMIT CODING :
    ---------------
    Our  status would  be something  like  comatic  guys 8-) Actually  the only
active members  left are THYREX (code) and me ST SURVIVOR (gfx and ToXiC Team).
BBFuck our greaaaat musician is still making nice tunes but on Falcon only. Our
BACK IN FRANCE demo is still to be completed and  even though  there are only a
few things to do, THYREX seems quite demotivated  and also  busy  with his job.
Anyway he  told me he would  try to find spare time to complete it! We have  no
other  project and  the ToXiC Mag  can be  assumed to  die soon in spite of the
heavy work done by THE BEAST.

    Btw you (I mean  if you can  speak French) can now read the HTML version of
the ToXiC MaG up to issue 13. We don't know if we gonna be more successful with
this new concept! Anyway you can always visit the ToXiC MaG online at
              http://www.chez.com/toxicmag
    

    Contact : You can reach Thyrex by writing to
    πππππππ   Thyrex aka Franck VEEGAERT
              4 rue Renoir
              59150 WATTRELOS - FRANCE

    Or email to me :
           ST Survivor aka Sebastien LARNAC at Larnac@hotmail.com


    SECTOR ONE :
    ----------
    Even though the  band is mainly working on Falcon with their AVI player and
other  utilities, one  can mention  that FIRST, former  member of DISPLASY, has
joined them. Also a Bomberman alike game called  MISTER BOOMER is on the way. A
demo  version is  already  available but  seems not to work on all Atari. Let's
wait for a more compatible version. Otherwise, no demo is planned (at least for
the ST).

    Contact : write to HELLO aka Christophe VILLENEUVE
    πππππππ   20 rue du Docteur Zamenhof
              18000 BOURGES - FRANCE


    ST KNIGHTS :
    ----------
    I know ALDYN and JACE are working hard on the RESURRECTION demo but I'm not
sure about  the others  involment in it... It seems that ALAN PARKER, DIEU  and
CREATEUR  are  quite  sleepy  now! Anyway  we  can  add  to  the  list  of  the
collaborators  ZAPPY of HOLOCAUST  and POI POI of RIBBON (remember I only speak
of the French ones!). About LEONARD / OXYGENE nothing has been confirmed yet...
ST KNIGHTS  should also  bring an intro for  next issue of the ToXiC Mag but it
surely depends on the development of their main demo...

    Contact : Avoid snail-mail coz they live on a remote island !  
    πππππππ   But you can either visit their site at :
              http://www.runnet.com/STKNIGHTS/index.html

    Or email to : 
                  JACE aka Laurent FARGUES at Jace.stk@runnet.com
  
    
    SURVIVORS :
    ---------
    Yes this  is a  new band!! Unfortunately  I can't  tell you  much about the
members, projects and so on. Maybe next time.


    TYPHOON :
    -------
    The ST COLLECTION # 11 should be out very soon and  the 12th will follow in
November  if  everything's  ok. THE BEAST  will maybe  get  new members  from a
newborn band called  SURVIVORS. They are said to have released small intros but
I haven't  seem them yet. Let's  hope we can  count them as really active. Even
though TYPHOON's japanese slide-show JAPAN SENSATION, first due to be made with
ARSENIC - a long long  time ago - is  completed  nothing can  be sure  about an
eventual release.

    Contact : the best way to get in touch with The Beast is       
    πππππππ   surely using his email : Beast_typhoon@hotmail.com

    You can also visit Senser at http://www.mygale.org/11/senser 
  
    Anyway if you want to send stuff for the ToXiC MaG or the next 
    issues of the ST Collection, you'd better use this address:
    
    The Beast aka Stephane PEREZ
    Les Hautes du Louvarou
    chemin de la garoudiäre
    38560 JARRIE - FRANCE

    So far  we haven't  received  news  from  Keops/EQX and Leonard/OXG who are
rumoured  to be  working on  some projects  with their  PCs using  the PacifiST
emulator...

    Almost all the  people mentionned above should meet at the Volcanic Party 4
that  will  most  probably  be held  in  February  98. Until  then, no  further
information, except unfounded rumours, can be taken seriously.

    Infos given  by ST Survivor. Note that I could be wrong about some facts or
not be informed  about others. I just try  to give you the clearest view of the
Surviving St scene in France.
