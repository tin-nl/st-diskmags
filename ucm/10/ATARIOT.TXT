My first thought was to do a review of this album, but after typing in all that
songtexts I am really to exhausted to review anything! Another  problem is that
I don't know how to  describe their sound. It  is some mixture of Punk (sampled
Guitars) and  some sort of Breakbeat-Techno. Anyway  it is some of the roughest
sounds I have ever heard. This is REAL CYBERPUNK!

1. GET UP WHILE YOU CAN (Alec Empire)
-------------------------------------

Get up while you can!!!!!!!!!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They try to knock us to the ground!!!!!!! Sell out! Sell out! Push us around!
Watch your back - here come the incredible!!!!!!!
The chance for future is makin' noise in my head!!!!
The bloodsuckers keep tryin' on ...
They do me in! They do me in!

I always wanted to see the end of this world... A thousand silverpearls
Crack down my brain!!!!!!!!
The city's coured my dark shadows - not too late to give your blood away!
You're in control of being under control!!!!!!!!

The rules are clear - you have no fear!!!!!!!!!!

Get up while you can!!!!!!!!!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your times are never changing and you're gonna be surprised!!!!!!!!
Always do what others do!!!!!!
They want you to compromise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I stand by the fire and I'm not satisfied .....
Death takes place like lightning
And nothing's ever the same again!!!!!!!!

Get up while you can!!!!!!!!!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you're just here to consume the new hipness - forget it!!!!!!
Everything's still the same!
Global changes have been made but the enemies stayed!!!!!!!!

Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Get up while you can!!!!!!!!!!! Get up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



2. FUCK ALL! (Alec Empire)

It's about that time that the Atari Teenage Riot is taking over...
and some people look at you and they ask you:

Did you try to say anything???? But how??????
You can't escape! You can't!
Losing control doesn't always have to lead into danger!
You have no choice or do you wanna stay a slave????
Are you going to resign?????

We disharmonize the entertainment industry!
Let's destroy the future! From here! From now!
We are the resistance!!!!!
Only when the old has died the new has a chance to be born...

5. DEUTSCHLAND (HAS GOTTA DIE!) (Hanin Elias/Alec Empire)
---------------------------------------------------------

Deutschland has gotta die ... (Eins, zwei, drei, vier!!!)
Wake up! Wake up! Get off your knees...

Where will the west strike next?

The war is still between east and west ...
Money talks! Money!!! You're so bored and sick!
Let's burn germany!
Building up economy of dead bodies! That's what they want!

We react very strongly to tranquilizers you know...

I need a diversion for a silent escape! Harder! Faster!
You know what they're after
You haven't suffered the same as I have!
Sensless neverending terror!!!
We make'em nervous... We make'em nervous...

Deutschland has gotta die ...
Wake up! Wake up! Get off your spleen!

What will the west strike next?

The war is still between east and west ...
Money talks! Money knows! You're so bored and sick!
Let's burn Deutschland!

The bloody wankers tried to pull us down...
Blow'em up! Blow'em up!
The bloody wankers try to pull us down but
we're smash them in!
But we're gonna smash them in!!!!!!!!!!!

The time is right to fight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



6. DESTROY 2000 YEARS OF CULTURE (Alec Empire)
----------------------------------------------

It's a dead world ...
and it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another ...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! Don't give up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not makin a stronger man
cause they don't understand!!!!!!!!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do????????
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
POW! We're on the move! Resist worldwide!
cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure:
We're gonna take over!
Radical! Terrorize! And I'm not gonna tell you lies!
Our chances are low - too many problems we gut!!!
Fuck the police!               Blow  em out!!!!!!!!!

Destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy 2000 years of culture!
(Move! We gotta move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Move!!!!           I shout it out loud!!!!!
We're radical and we're proud of it ...
Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!!!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game

And I sing the song to the freedom to hate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Try to think international!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy 2000 years of culture!
(Move! We gotta move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

Your freedom to speak is a freedom to lie!!!!!!!
Whatever it takes to change  ...I'm up for it!!!!!
There's no place where noone get's hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!!!!!!!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head ...
They always try to get you back to what they define as reality!!!!!!!
There's nothing to loose but watch your back!
It's cold out there...    (Don't wait too long!!!)

Destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy 2000 years of culture!
(Move! We gotta move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)



7. NOT YOUR BUSINESS (Alec Empire)
----------------------------------

You get stupid every day - every night - more! more!
What you gonna do?                       more!
Do it not to me!                 War!
You wanna be rich! rich! rich! Fuck! Fuck!
You gonna die!

Perfect death in a colourful TV Screen
See me! See me! See nothing! Switch off!
Come with me thru the wall of time
See you every day we gonna watch you every second

But that's not your business!
But that's not your business! Not your business!

Aggression! Oppression! Fuck the fashion system!
Where you gonna suck is where you gonna lie!
Lie! Lie! Lie! You lied to me! to me! T.O.M.E.!
Vicious! Vicious! Where you gonna ****
But that's not your business!
That's not your business!

Don't try and treat me like the shit you eat every day!
Our days are numbered!!!!!!



8. YOU CAN'T HOLD US BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Alec Empire)
-----------------------------------------------------

Stick with the needle in your vein
and the drum beats go like this..........

We live day by day and you never gonna hold us back
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can see the sky turn white and you gonna take it out for more!!!!!!!!!
Are you gonna take it out for more????????????????
Are you gonna take it out for more????????????????
Are you gonna take it out for more????????????????

And that is the way that it's always gonna be!!!!!!!!!!
That is the day when they all gonna see flames and fire
burning business buildings .....
fuckin' politicians - your smile on your nice face makes me spit blood
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And you walk across the line and you start talking behind my back

another day to waste my time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and you will wait for a lifetime to spend your life in sunshine
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can't hold us back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9. HEATWAVE (Alec Empire)
-------------------------

1, 2, 3, 4
try my identity - you wannt kill yourself - you gonna see!
I captured you in your TV - your beauty is your worst enemy!
Don't even try to be! avoid the shit and give the key
never listen to what you say! I never gonna die for Germany!
I'm like a heatwave burning thru your heart...
I look in the mirror and what do I see?
It will all end in anarchy!
I feel the wankers speeding up the truth
and the pussies eating up the fools
stop telling me the bullshit of conspiracy
you seem as naive as democracy...
I'm like a heatwave
I'm like a heatwave they say...
let's go!
A T A R I   T E E N A G E   R I O T !
may I ask you? where are the results?
Where are the results????????????????
where you gonna go? what you gonna do about it???
As I left the supermarket two policemen grapped me and they said:
"You're the cunt that we were waiting for..."
they didn't need a reason they never do...
the state uses violence to keep everything in their order!
We don't use violence to find a role in this society!
We use violence to beat this society!
boredom causes a stillstand. no movement!
see what you get outta this...
Tell me the truth!!!
Tell me the truth!!!
Heatwave!!! Heatwave!!! I'm like a heatwave they say!!!



10. REDEFINE THE ENEMY (Alec Empire)
------------------------------------

Some feel the excitement of boredom
some don't...
But one day you will step outside
and you will feel the heat...
you hear the sirens of death and they sound:
Afraid
We're back where we were ten years ago
and I'm feeling like I'm starting my old life from new
This is your last chance...
What's on your mind?????

Nothing. I'm gonna die for for nothing!
nothing else that matters...
But what do you want from me?
Anti-Fashion seems to be fashion too by now
I don't need stupid policemen taking care about me
I don't need anyone!
I take it all by myself! Myself!!!!!
Can you hear me???????? Can you hear me????????

Tell me the truth you fuckface!!!
I'm gonna kill anyone for more!!!!!!!!!!
suck me up for a better reason and I'm gonna cut you short...

If only Technology keeps moving you forward
and you're not prepared for the future
you become a naive child left in an information overload unit...
What's holding us back this time!
Worldleaders choose worldleaders...
not us, not democracy, not a revolution!!!!!!!!!!
time to stop the germanization of this planet...
I've a fear of a white planet...

I redefine the enemy! Redefine the enemy!!!!!!!!!!!

I broke the ice and I drowned
they want you dead but alive enough to function!
Everything gets out of control
But what do you do? Tonight?
Let's get back on the street - start living again...
Anything worth having is worth fighting for!!!!

It's important that the future is on our side!!!!!
On my side...
white house and white snow...

The final moment has come - it's all over!!!!!!!!!!
It seems that you still have power in reserve...
But we are winning...
Are you praying in your dispair??????????

I redefine the enemy! I've got to redefine the enemy!
Redefine the enemy...
Here I come!!! Don't bother me!!!
There's nothing we can do!!!!!
It's not my style to just wait to be killed!!!!
I'll wipe you all out!!!
Now is the chance... I'm covered by a blue shadow...
I fear no longer... I fear no longer...

Redefine the enemy!

I redefine the enemy...



11. DEATH STAR (Alec Empire)
----------------------------

I feel like a death star - abused by control - grey - without any emotions
pull me into the right direction and I will kill you!
I capture a thousand lives
I wait for instructions - I can't wait!!!!!
Blow me away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I only destroy to demonstrate my powers -
born to observe the confusion
Your fear is my freedom - and I eat you alive
my mistakes are too complex for you to understand!
For you to fight...
I bring the light!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No one survived my shadow - ever!
When I need you - I start protecting you
My love gives you life
A death star
I am your death star...
You can't wait to blow me away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



12. THE FUTURE OF WAR (A. Empire)
---------------------------------

Is this the future of war?????
The future of war!
T H E   F U T U R E   O F   W A R!
come on down to the end of the future...
we not gonna make it another day
fighting the fight we have to fight!
You not gonna make me run away!!!!!!!!!
You! You fucked me over
A white moon is shining down on me...
Where do we belong?????
W H E R E   D O   W E   B E L O N G ? ? ? ? ?
Punk for money - piss for gold!
nothing ain't what it used to be!
I   D O N ' T   F E A R   T H E   L I F E   I   W A N N A   L I V E
I don't fear the nothing I have to see:
The future of war!
The future of war!
We never talked a revolution
We never played the cliche!
That was you having old images in your head!
W E   D O N T   N E E D   T O   P R O V O K E   A N Y O N E  . . .
I T ' S   J U S T   A   W A S T E   O F   T I M E
Two minutes before action...
Check my card - It's O.K.
Check my soul and throw it away!
Crack my life and you gonna die!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw his eyes...
A   P O S E   L I K E   T H I S   A T   M I D N I G H T!
It's obvious that capitalism has failed!
This is the future...
The future of war!
The future of war! It's like a heatwave burning through my soul!!!!
The future of war! War! War! War!
T H E   F U T U R E   O F   W A R!
