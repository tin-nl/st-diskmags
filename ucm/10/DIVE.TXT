When I  first saw  the cover  of this  CD I was  slightly  repulsed. The  front
picture is  mostly black  with some greyish  bodyparts stitched together. Not a
very  pretty sight. But I  heard from a  friend that  this was  one of the best
elektro-formations in the last years, so I gave it a try.
And the sound was pretty weird. I never heard anything like it. My stomach felt
a bit  weak after  hearing  the album  for the  first  time. 8-/ Some songs are
incredibly  teazing  and  minimalistic. Analogue  machines  are  used,  totally
distorted and looped a million times.
Some  other  songs  are  incredibly  loud  and  use  a  bassdrum that's totally
distorted  along with earpiercing  screaching noises and really harsh screaming
distorted vocals. Pretty unique and pretty sick.
The rythm is  mostly slow and I  think it will apeal to both hardcore Goths and
elektro  freaks. One or  two songs are really strange. They use old, Kraftwerk-
esque rythms, but with the harsh vocals and noises thrown in. 
Strange...
There are 16 songs on the album, so for the money (about 25 DM) it really isn't
bad. It is original as well as well as extreme so I think it's well worth a try
for you experimental-minded persons out there.
Just as a little curiosity:
