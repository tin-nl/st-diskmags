                                  "BLUE MOON"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Strange Ways 1994

Yep, here it is, the maxi-single with the german  bonus-track "Endlose Tr„ume".
Ok, it's  an older  single I want  to review  today but  who cares? After I had
written the article about their second  live-album called "Fairylive" and there
also lost some  words about this  german song I  had searched for the single on
which it was included... but back to the roots...
The contents of this maxi-CD:

1. Blue Moon - radio edit
2. Blue Moon - 12" mix
3. Endlose Tr„ume
4. Someone to draw the sword

As you can see there are two previous unreleased tracks included and this isn't
only on this single. All De/Vision-singles have some bonus-stuff...
The two "Blue Moon"-tracks  doesn't reach  the album-version and the 12"-mix is
also a bit ugly. With this mix they've  tried to create something like electro-
pop but they failed. They are and will be a pure synthie-band, nothing more but
also nothing less.
The two bonus-tracks are cool, even if the second is extremly slow. Great stuff
with the right touch of melancholy... soft vocals and synthies... nice!
btw... I will not  include the lyrics of both bonus-tracks. For the "Blue Moon"
lyrics you must  search in  another UCM-issue. I'm a bit too lazy to write them
down today...
