                      through the soft shades of summer
                                fused together
                     by the strange  seasons of the city

                     the stationary is  stained with all
                                 my  failings

                            the bed lays  now cold
                            and empty  as a casket
                  your body left it's shape upon the sheets
                               and little  else

                            I shall dress  my room
                         in the colours of sadness...

                              -----------------

o Today is the day when DJ DAG plays  his last  Clubnight on  the german radio-
  channel HR3. He  will leave  Germany at  the beginning  of June. He  bought a
  ranch  in  California  to  live  and  work  there. His sets  are very Trance-
  dominated and  I have to admit that  I don't like Trance-music that much like 
  in the past. Some  years ago Trance was really MY THING but in 1997 Trance is 
  dead! Fuckings to Robert Miles and those other Trance-Killers.
  But when he has left germany things will never be the same again.

o Timewarp. Today  is the day  when Hongkong  will be given  back to RED CHINA!
  Everyone in  Hongkong is celebrating that shit! I don't trust this peace! For 
  many  years we all  knew that this  day will come sometime but now that it is 
  here I can't really believe it. I have a bad feeling...

o One of the best  labels for  electronic music  left the  world. I am speaking
  about HARTHOUSE/EYE-Q which went brankrupt. That's very sad because they have 
  released  many cool  Tracks. For  example from DER DRITTE RAUM, EARTH NATION, 
  ZYON, ARPEGIATORS, VIRTUAL SYMMETRY and lotsa more. Rest in Peace.

o Kool Rock  Steady. One of the  Hip-House pioneers from 1989 died. He made Hip 
  House really big those days. Tyree Cooper - the producer. Or some super duper 
  trouper. He  make the  bass boys bangin'. Bring the noise. Turn up the bass - 
  and get ready - for the one KOOL ROCK STEADY!
   
o In 1992 KLF stopped makin' music  and that really was a dissapointing moment.
  But not as shockin  as the day when  Thorsten Fenslau, a german D.J., died in
  1993. The decay  began in  those days. Now I  can say  this is not my Techno-
  scene anymore. Most things have  changed and even the  music is minimal shit!
  It was fun to hear that  Jimmy Cauty/KLF is  experimenting with Noise-Weapons
  that he  bought from  the british army. One neighbour from the next farm want 
  to accuse him because the milk from his cows got sour. :-)   

o This article seems to make no sense. But what in the world does?
  
  
Can you afford a magrathean planet?
