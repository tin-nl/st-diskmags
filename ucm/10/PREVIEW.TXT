                           PREVIEW TO UNDERCOVER 11
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, there will be a new issue and we have many things to do.

At first I  hope we will have  a new shell. Ear_X of FUN is still  working on a
shell after we can't include his work for UCM 10 because of too many bugs.
Even if a  brainblasting shell isn't  the mainthing on a magazine it's  besides
the  info the most  important thing. You all  know how it  sucks to  read a mag
without a stabile and easy to handle shell.
Also another surprise is planned but we will not loose any words about it.
What about the contents?
Hopefully a right invitation for the next INTERJAM Party, MORE interviews, MORE
reviews (including the missing stuff from this issue). There are a lot of demos
in the pipeline and we can't await it to get our hands on them.
I hope also  to get a fullversion  of RUNNING for a final test (if I can fix my
Falcon...) and of course some other funny stuff will be tested.

UCM 11 will hit the scene in March '98! So be prepared! We'll come back!
