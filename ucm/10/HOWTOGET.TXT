                     HOW TO GET THE UNDERCOVER MAGAZINE?!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum, this should  be no problem. You can get  it on very different ways, right
after the  release of every issue. The  most of the older issues should be lay
somewhere in the Internet and can also be downloaded from the .tnb. HQ-boards.

Ok, you can download it short after the release from the following boards:

Germany   - THE JUNCTION BBS (tnb/tscc/vex/e!)
          - THE SUBWAY BBS
          
Sweden    - ELITE'S HIDEOUT  (e!/tnb/efx/pulse/supremacy/legion/tcw/wildfire)
          - HEAVEN'S TRASH   (vex/tscc)
          
The latest issues can also be found on the .tSCc. Homepage:

http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uno4/

Finally you can order them under the following snail-mail-adds:

Germany   - Moondog of .tnb.
            Eric Henschler, Weichau 1a, 06618 Weichau
            
Poland    - Grey of Shadows
            Michal Michalowski, ul. goszczynskiego 2/10, 80-134 Gdansk
            
But please try especially  before ordering  from the german  snail-mail-add the
other ways, because I'm very  limited in time and money and so it would be very
great if you could include return-postage to your letters (for both snail-adds)

Ok, I hope that  the list of the  official UCM-spreaders will grow even more in
the next time... So, are you interested in joining the UCM-distribution-posse?!
Just get in touch with me (Moondog)!
