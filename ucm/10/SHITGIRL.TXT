ObjeCt: SPICE GIRLS DEMO
pOSsEE: EFFECT
nEeEdZ: ATARI ST/E, 2 DISKS

===============================================================================

Now we come to an really unnecessary thing. The "SPICE GIRLS Demo" by Sinbad of
Effect is another effort that no one needs! The David Bowie demo was  something
that could be taken more seriously than this shit!
Hey Sinbad! You  talked about  popular demand  for the  SPICE GIRLS. You are so
right, but there is NO demand in the Atari-scene for them.
Let's come to the review.

First some SPICE-logo  is swinging up and down. Some jumping girl animation can
be seen in the upper left  and right of the screen. At the bottom of the screen
there is a NOT VERY smooth scrolltext. This demo was again released in February
1997. When you press space a loading screen appears and then you have to insert
disc 2. The rest of the demo consists of lotsa pictures from the SPICE GIRLS in
average quality (ever heard anything from PHOTOCHROME, eh?). The whole time you
hear loops of some SPICE GIRLS singles. The torture reaches from WannBe to Mama
and nothing is spared from us.

No one says that they look ugly. No. We would not say No if they would SUCK our
DICKS! They are just  some wet bitches standing infront of a microphone singin'
lalalala. NO ONE NEEDS SUCH SHIT! THIS IS REALLY JUST A WASTE OF DISKS!

Oh Sinbad! Please make a DIANA demo that we can talk about so nice again!!!
