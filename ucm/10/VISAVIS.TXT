                               VIS-A-VIS SAMPLER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Visage Records 1997

I had two reasons for buying  this sampler. At first  I had seen an advert in a 
music-magazine  and there  was standing  something about  electro/synthie-stuff
besides this and  the second reason was the very cheap price. Where can you get
a new full-time-sampler for  only 14 DM?! Ok, this could be also a big  failure
but it doesn't care to me... and so I've bought it today and want to write also
a review of it for you...
But before I go into a real review let me take a look at the contents...

Hum... now, after I'd listened to the whole CD I'm sitting on this shitty PC to
write the review, but I don't know about what. I had to hide my anger about the
sampler  and now I  can understand  the  cheap price. Ok, it  isn't all for the
trashcan but there  is some stuff  on this CD which is no electro or synthie or
something other pop... But let me lose some words about the single tracks...
The first band  isn't unknown  and if  you want to  know something  about their
style just listen to older DeMo or Erasure-stuff... more to say? I think not...
Ok, not a bad track, but nothing special and it doesn't reach the idols...
The second band, btw. under  the same label  as the first  one (Svenska Energy),
sounds really like  OMD on their  album "Suggar Tax" ... oh boy... ok, I really
like this album (it remembers me to my first trip  to Sweden 6 years ago) but I
think every band should  try to find an  own style... this song sounds too much
like OMD and this isn't good for the image.
POINT OF VIEW aren't  unknown to me and I  like both songs of  them, even  if I
miss the guitars in the first track =)... these two songs are without any doubt
some of the best, pure electro-pop, nothing more but it's alright.
The next band starts under the label STRANGE WAYS which have produced such cool
bands as WOLFSHEIM, DEVISION, ZOON POLITICON or  BEBORN BETON... hum, but  with
LOVE? they  had not the  right hand. It's a  fast track with very ugly synthie-
sound... arrgl... shit!
And after this track the CD loses a lot of quality. The next two songs remember
a bit to UNDERWORLD (U surely  know their  songs "Moaner" or "Born Slippy") and
especially the second seems to  be inspired by the  new PRODIGY-style. But both
idols were never reached, miles away... Totally shit! 
The two tracks by MORTAL are  pure techno-stuff. The  first is with  nearly ten
minutes  really too long and  the second features very slow beats and something
like  ethno-influences... I don't  like it, especially  because I'm  not on the
techno-trip anymore.
Also the track by RAME is pure hardtrance stuff... nothing more  to say... btw,
the  most  tracks on this  sample, escp. the whole  technoid  stuff, comes from
Control Records... this should say all...
With the  next two tracks the  quality and also  the electro-pop  cames back to
life. Both starting with fast technoid beats and at first I thought it would be
the same shit  as before, but  a female voice starts to sing, clear like bells,
and it sounds great to me. I like such stuff very much... cool stuff!
Also  the two tracks  by AQUA aren't  bad, but for me they're  working too much
with the piano and they're  trying to be very  melancholic and it doesn't sound
as it should be...
Hum, the last shitty track is coming up and if you want to know something about
the style  of ARCANA just try  to assemble  pure Erasure-voices  with  electro-
guitar-pop... I like also ERASURE's music but this  track is shit, no question.
The last song is also the last highlight and for  me one of the best. It's very
slow  synthie-stuff, not  too  much, with  some little  guitar-sounds  and nice
and soft voices... great for relaxing...
All in one this sampler leaves  a split impression in my mind  because it's too
much techno-stuff  included, esp. because  it's  no techno-sampler  and for  me
there are big  differencies between  techno and electro/synthie-stuff... If you
like both style you can buy this  sampler, esp. because of the cheap price, but
all guys which love only the synthie-stuff should let it laying in the shops...
