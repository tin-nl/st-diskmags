Believe it or not, but VEXNEWS #6 is already here! It was not my intention
that it should be released this soon, but here it is! Actually I forgot
that I had promised the MonST command summary for issue #4 to a few people,
so I thought I could as well make anoher little newsletter! As I start
typing I canot stop, the adrenaline is kicking and the fingers are bleeding
of hunger to write, write, write!!!! ;-)


[3] Vectronix Gfx Competition!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We're hereby announcing a Vectronix Graphix Competition! We need new,
fresh, cool and outstanding logos for our forthcoming webpage(s). There is
no other prices than fame and glory to this competition. You will get your
name mentioned if we use your graphics, and we will try to make a toplist
of the ones we like best if we recieve enough contributions. Take the
chance and prove how good gfx artist you are!

Please let us know if you or anyone else in your crew is considering to
take part of this competition so we know what to expect. Finished graphics
can be mailed directly to phoenix@weirdness.com or uploaded to one of our
headquarters.


[4] Want to Become a Kickass Cracker?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, won't we all? ;-) As we brings you the shortkeys for the most popular
and well used debugger there ever was for the atari, maybe a few wise words
about cracking could be in good place as well. There's a few things you
must ask yourself and the most important I think is if you have the moral
to crack software? What it means is to remove the protection from a program
so that it can be copied and/or spread without any limits. The author might
loose money on this, and he will not be happy when he finds out what YOU
have done to his beloved piece of work.

There is other aspects of this subject as well, cracking software for a
dying platform as the atari might be a very good solution to keep it alive,
and keep people to stay with it! People who uses cracked software would
never buy it anyway, and it allows you to test before you buy etc...

So, you have decided you want to learn how to crack? Good, stay with us!
How do one proceed to crack a program you might ask? How does it work? What
do you need? Well, the most important thing of it all, which you cannot get
away from is your assembler knowledge! The better you know assembler, the
better cracker you will be, no question about it! If you don't know
assembler at all you should stop thinking about cracking and learn to code
in assembler first, you _need_ to know how things works in order to crack,
and do _not_ think you can take easy on this part, there is _no_ shortcuts!

When you learn to code in assembler, you also learn how to use a debugger
to trace your programs and find out what's happening for every instruction
you pass by. The debugger is the crackers best friend, some people use
dissassemblers as well, and it can be usefull sometimes, but most of your
time you will spend in the debugger.

This is really what you need to start with, if you know assembler and you
know how to master the debugger, you will also know how to crack, almost
atleast. A good cracker will need a lot of patience, time and imagination,
he need to be able to look forward, and know what will happen next. You're
playing a game, it's you against the protection and you cannot give up just
like that, you have to defent your honour from the evil dark side... ;-)

There is many different protections, some better than other, but most of
them are really lame. If we take a very easy example, a shareware program
which needs to be registered in order to unlock all the fatures. There is
usually a register dialog to do this somewhere, let's find this! We enter a
fake name and serialnumber, and starts tracing. We are now looking for a
working serialnumber so we can replace the fake one we just entered. Sooner
or later an alertbox will probably pop up telling it was the wrong
serialnumber, "shit!" you may think, it didn't work! Well, if we look on
the code right before this alertbox we might find something which looks
like this.

        cmp.l   d0,d1
        beq.s   $154553
        bsr     wrong_code
        bra.s   $154545

Okay, this was a _very_ easy example, but believe it or not, sometimes it
looks just like this! What happens here is that the values in the data
registers d0 and d1 is being compared, if equal we will jump to the
location we're we will get a nice little message telling the program was
correctly registered, if it was not equal we will get that ugly alertbox
right in our face saying we failed, you remember it don't you?

If we stop here and think for a while, what are we looking for? What is
happening here? Can we put this together in some way? Yeah, probably! If we
look into the dataregisters again, we might just find the fake serialnumber
we entered before, it have probably been converted into a hex value though.
If you're not a living hexadecimal calculator (I know one who is) you bring
up the little calculator tool (press "O" in MonST), enter d0 since it
contains teh value we want to convert. And hey, look at that! It _is_ our
serialnumber!

So, we found the serialnumber we entered when we should register the
program, and this value was then being compared to another value, remember?
Then, what if we try the other value in that registration dialog instead?
Yeah, let's give it a try... bring up the calculator again and convert the
value in d1 so we get a nice code to enter in the serialnumber field. Then
go ahead and register the program again, and I bet you'll be successfull
this time!

Let's pretend the above code was in the startup sequence of the program
instead, the dataregisters does not contain the serialnumber but some
control value instead, we cannot find any serialnumber. If the serialnumber
is not correct, the program will be terminated. Hmmm, we could try to force
the program to think the serialnumber was okay, let's replace the beq
instruction with a bra instruction and the program will always think the
code was okay. You see the point?

Now please remember this was a very simple example, it's not always as
simple as this, but as said, sometimes it is. This all gives you a basic
idea of what it is about though. It's always best if you can find a working
serialnumber and don't need to do modifications to the program, this way
you know the program is 100% registered, and it might also work with future
versions as well. Perfection is important, more about that later.

If you want to practise or try cracking at a novice level, get the address
register program DaCapo and use it as your first victim. This is one of the
easiest programs to crack I have ever seen, the serialnumber is only 3
characters long, and you should be able to find it quite simple. It still
requires you to know assembler and how to use a debugger though, this is
something you have to learn on your own. If there is interest for it I can
go through the basic of how to do things in the debugger, but I cannot
teach you assembler...

Please send us response to this article, whether you liked it or not, if
you found it interesting and useful or just a piece of crap. If there is
interest for more things like this, please let us know!


[5] Finishing, Preparing and Packaging the Release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the crackers in Vectronix perfectionism is of high priority. First it's
_very_ important that the crack is working properly, therefore we try to
test it as much as possible. We always use a work directory for the program
we're cracking, and when it's done we do all testing here. When it's time
to pack it, we unzip a new fresh and untouched version. We add our *.nfo
file containing the serialnumber, a short description of the program and
such things and also the file_id.diz description. If we did modifications
to the program (or other files) we replace these as well.

It's important that everything is just the way it was in the original
distribution. We pack it all together using Lharc, and then we unpack this
almost-ready-to-go file and run testings on it again, to see that our
distribution really _is_ working the way it's supposed to do. Now the
release is ready!

You might call us insane, but for us it's normal. Our job is to bring you
high quality and working cracks, and we don't take easy on this. We want
everyone to know that a Vectronix release is of the highest possible
quality, and that you always can trust that it works the way it's supposed
to work.


[6] MonST v3.x Command Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We bring you the shortcuts for the popular debugger MonST/MonTT which comes
with the Devpac assembler package. This command summary was copied directly
from the Amiga Devpac/Amon manual by Phoenix some years ago, but they are
the same for the Atari. We have had these for years, but nobody ever asked
for them so we thought there was no interest in them, we where wrong... ;-)

[4] Who is Ryder of Vectronix?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We thought we should let our newest member have some space and write a few
words about himself, as a small introduction so you guys get to know him a
bit better. Ok, let's see.....

Who is that guy?!
=================

Umm.. CooL!! This is where I get to brag. Not that there is much to brag
about, but I STill get to.

You may all remember me from the 'good old days' of bbs'ing. It was not all
that long ago that we used to all congregate on bulletin boards and trade
warez/info. I used to be on all the good North American boards trading
whatever. Occasionally calling the better overseas boards when you used to
be able to phreak without getting a life sentence for doing so. But my main
hangouts were STampede, Happy Hideaway, LiP SERViCE (My Private BBS),
DreamWave (formerly Tha Rock) which I was 'CO'. I've been an avid Atari Fan
since buying my first way back in.. Geez.. (can't remember) Well.. anyways
it was a 2600. Then a couple years later I moved up to a Atari 400 & 800xl.
That's when all the fun started! I got a whoppin' 300 baud modem and
started calling local BBS's and did a bit of hacking into boards and
trading with a few of the local hackers. I had found my calling! I lingered
around the scene for the next 10 years trading and meeting with friends on
various Atari BBS's and upgrading to the latest Atari hardware bringing me
to where I am now. A FULL fledged member of Atari's #1 group. Vectronix! My
job is distribution. I must supply YOU! I have and probably never will be a
hacker as C++ to me is only a mark I would occasionally get from one of my
teachers if I was lucky! ;-) I content being only a trader, as I don't want
anymore pressure then I already have. I'll leave all the boring hard stuff
to Phoenix and Metallinos. and the other extremely talented guys. <g>.

Anyways.. you can wakeup now, as I'm finished babbling!! :-) If you used to
hang on those boards and yak'ed with me.. drop me a line! I'd love to hear
from you. Send to: vectronix@hotmail.com  Attn: RYdER.

[5] Backdoor (or bug) in MagiC 5?!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's an interesting thing for all you MagiC users, coming from Faramir.
To me it seems Faramir have just made the discovery of the clipboard, but
who knows, there might be the evil forces of satan who's behind all of
this, as always.... ;-) Well, let's see what he has to say....

Magic is a very powerful platform to use as a multitask environment.

But today, the 18 of august 1997, I came up to something somewhat insane.
This morning, I wrote a letter with everest running under magic 5, and i
came back 2 hours later. i turned to starcall and saw a mess going on in
the terminal window. When it stopped, I saw the last line of the letter i
was typing with everest.

I don't know when this backdoor activates but it sure can be scary, for
example if you are typing a message to crypt with pgp while online under
the terminal program.

The only thing to do to avoid this is to exit any terminal program when
typing a message. you can load back the program without losing the carrier.

Joined to this archive (see below), a numerological analysis that could
explain this backdoor and tell why magx 5 looks like windoze 95.

[7] Hotmail - Free Email Provider
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

As many of you probably have noticed we have our own email address for
Vectronix, it's vectronix@hotmail.com. Although there is a handfull of
services which provides free email accounts for free, Hotmail is what we
use, and we're very happy with it.

The main advantage with Hotmail is that it's totally www-based, this means
you only need a web-browser in order to check your mail, no matter where
you are. For our purpose it also means that we can easily share the account
within the group, although it has it's sideeffects also as we might reply to
the same letters if we don't delete them etc.... ;-)

Below is a small introduction to what Hotmail is really about, and who
might have interest in this at all. Read it through and check out the links
to see if Hotmail is something for you. It's totally free, so the chances
are that you'll find a use for it!

What is Hotmail?
================

Hotmail is a great solution for so many people. Even if you don't fit into
one of the listed sample categories, chances are Hotmail is right for you!

Hotmail is right for...

* People who currently share an email account

Tired of sharing your email box with other people in your household? If so,
Hotmail is a great solution. Everyone who registers gets their own private
email account. It's free, give it a try.

* People who already have email through their company

Hotmail provides a free personal email account that is yours, not your
company's. Having a separate, personal email address with Hotmail protects
your privacy. Additionally, if you change employers you have a working
email address.

* Mobile Professionals

Have you ever been away from the office, at a client's office for example,
and unable to check for a vital email? This is no longer a problem with
Hotmail. If you can access the world wide web, you can check your email.
Hotmail also lets you travel light. Hotmail lets you retrieve your
presentation (or any other files) upon arrival at your destination. Just
send yourself an email to your Hotmail address with a document attached.

* Students

Hotmail is priced right for the student population - it's free. From any
place that you can access the world wide web you can send and receive your
personal email. In addition to universally accessible, free email you get
to keep your Hotmail address for life. So go ahead switch schools, travel
abroad, or just take a job in the real world -- we'll keep your email.

* Teachers

If you have more students than Internet access accounts, Hotmail may be
your solution. There is nothing to buy or install. Simply have your
students register for their own email accounts with Hotmail. They will have
a fully functional email account without any administration on your part.

* People who don't even own a computer

As hard as it may be to believe, you don't even need a computer to use
Hotmail. All you need is Internet access and a browser. As libraries,
cafes, and other venues provide Internet access you will soon be able to
obtain your email from every street corner.

* Internet Access Bargain Hunters

Want to look for the best deals as Internet service provision becomes a
commodity? If you keep you email with Hotmail you can jump from free offer
to free offer without having to change your email address... it's always
your_user_name@hotmail.com.

* Anyone who wants free, universal access to email

If you are away from your computer or LAN, you usually will be unable to
conduct email. However, since your Hotmail is located at our web site you
can send and retrieve email from anywhere you have a browser and an
Internet connection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, many of you probably wondered what happened after the last adrenaline
kick where we brought you 3 issues of this little newsletter at once. It's
almost a month since this little "incident", and I'm glad to say we're
back! But as always, you can never tell when a new vexnews issue is to
come, so there's no need to ask... ;-)

We have not been idling during this period though, we have some real hot
releases which I'll try to cover later on, we have been working with our
webpage (as usual), we have made it easier for you to get in touch with us,
and alot of other different stuff!

I got into a little personal depression period also, there was simply too
much shit happening at once and I couldn't take it all, I've been very busy
with school work as I have started studying again, and I'm simply not used
to this. Alot of thoughts was circulating in my head, and I needed a break
from everything, I needed to be able to think clear for a while!

This issue will be a bit different from other as I see it right now, there
will not be any news or article alike stuff, this issue is mainly intented
to give some lights to our latest releases, we hope nobody will miss them!
Oh well, let's see what it turns out to, you never know until it's done!

I would also like to welcome all our new subscribers since last time,
there's a whole bunch of you and I guess you all thought you subscribed to
nothing. If you want to catch up with previous issues you can get them all
by sending an email like this...

To: phoenix@weirdness.com
Subject: get vexnewsX (where X=1 to current issue)

Please note that this is all automatic, there's no way to request issues to
be sent to some other address or anything like that. If you need it
delievered somewhere else, please change your reply-to kludge to this
address.

If anyone would like to unsubscribe for some reason, or change his email
address for this list, please send us an email and tell us! We have quite
alot of subscribers already, but we're always looking for more to be able
to inform the whole scene about what's going on. So if you have any friends
or know anyone who would be interested in receiving these newsletters,
please tell them to contact us!

[4] TOSBOX, an Atari ST emulator - What it is
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOSBOX provides an environment for running TOS and GEM applications under
DOS or Windows. It uses an operating system image which you can create on
your actual Atari machine, and operates with most of the PC's peripherals.

The design of TOSBOX is unique in working from the system down rather than
from the hardware up. The goal was not to make a PC behave as exactly as
possible like an ST, but to run Atari applications as smoothly as possible
on a PC. Whenever possible, system calls were redirected and translated;
then, only in cases where that failed to be reliable, the behavior of the
actual hardware behavior was emulated. The resulting product is able to run
a considerable variety of popular software. I am interested to hear your
results on specific programs so I can list conflicts in future
documentation and continue to improve compatibility.

I wish to emphasize that TOSBOX is not a complete hardware-level emulation
of an Atari ST. As such, it is not intended to run games and graphics
demos. For that I strongly suggest using PaCifiST, written by that
intelligent and genial Frenchman, Frederic Gidouin.

The CPU emulation core is written in assembly, and its speed on a Pentium
75 is typically about twice that of a stock STf, depending on the task.
Because of the design objectives described above, TOSBOX does a
disproportionate amount of its work in the PC domain rather than in CPU
emulation, so in practical terms it is faster than the numbers would
suggest.

[5] ICQ - What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

ICQ - Product Description ICQ is a revolutionary, user-friendly Internet
tool that informs you who's on-line at any time and enables you to contact
them at will. No longer will you search in vain for friends or associates
on the Net. ICQ does the searching for you, alerting you in real time when
they log on. The need to conduct a directory search each time you want to
communicate with a specific person is eliminated. With ICQ, you can chat,
send messages, files and URL's, play games, or just hang out with your
fellow 'Netters' while still surfing the Net.

It lets you choose the mode of communication you wish to employ. Regardless
of the application, be it chat, voice, whiteboard, data conferencing, file
transfer or Internet games, ICQ will get your entire message across in real
time.

ICQ supports a variety of popular Internet applications and serves as a
Universal Platform from which you can launch any peer- to- peer application
(such as Microsoft NetMeeting or Netscape CoolTalk).

It can also be used in a multiple-user mode, so groups can conduct
conferences or just 'hang out' on-line.

The program runs in the background, taking up minimal memory and Net
resources. While you work with other applications, ICQ alerts you when
friends and associates log in, allowing you to work efficiently while
maintaining a wide range of Internet functions at your fingertips. Among
the functions available are: chat, message, e-mail, and URL and file
transfer.

All these functions are consilidated into one easy-to-use program that
integrates smoothly into desktop systems.

How does it work? It's simple. When you install ICQ, the program asks you
to register at a server, which is connected to a broad network of servers
spanning the Internet. At the time of registration, you receive a unique
UIN (Universal Internet Number). In addition, ICQ gives you the option of
entering personal information along with your UIN. This allows other ICQ
users to recognize you when you log on.

Once you've registered, you can compile a selected list of friends and
associates. ICQ uses this list to find your friends for you. Meanwhile, ICQ
waits quietly in the background without interrupting any other applications
in use. As soon as you log onto the Internet, ICQ automatically detects the
Internet connection, announces your presence to the Internet community and
alerts you when friends sign on or off.

Once you know who's on, all it takes is a click of an icon to initiate
chat, implement URL transfers, send messages , exchange files, or launch
any external peer-to-peer applications.

[3] Atari-Fair Neuss, Germany. A Short Overview.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This year the ATARI fair took place in NEUSS, Germany, again. After last
years disaster with this show, as you probably remember, time and place of
the fair changed in short-time, this year¥s show was organized very well.
As Ali Goukassian, the master of the FALKE-Verlag was somehow involved in
the show¥s organization this must really be called a wonder! Unbelievable!
A lot more exhibitors than in 1996 found their way to Neuss, this was good
news.

There have been a lot of exhibitors showing stuff for Jaguar and Lynx which
both were buyable for a very cheap price. Even 16/32 Bit Systems from the
UK have been at the show. And they showed a joystick for the Jaguar from
GRAVIS which had the incredible price of 145 DM which was cheap compared to
the original UK-price of about 129 pounds...

For us it¥s more interesting to see which companies did some new stuff for
the ATARI-computer series. There have been e.g. R.O.M, ASH and
MW-electronic and many more producers showing their product-palette:

EBACKUP 2
ECOPY 1.72
JINNEE 1.0
MAGIC 5.13
NVDI 4.11 R10
PAPYRUS 5.5
PHOENIX 5
SIGNUM!4.2
TEXEL 1.6
THING 1.2
TOS2WIN 2.0

and lots of other stuff..

Well, I must admit, some of the packages are already released by VECTRONIX
or are at least on it¥s way to be released by VECTRONIX... but if you have
the possibility to get hold of one or more of the packages which are not
released by VECTRONIX, please get in tough with us! We are always willing
to produce new releases for our friends in scene, but we need YOUR support!

There have been available some newer games for ATARI FALCON, which have not
been cracked by anyone. E.g. there was a new updated version for Conquest
(?) of C... well, shit, I forgot that whole name... but I¥m pretty sure you
know which game I¥m talking about. I must admit: I didn¥t see any new games
for ST/STE, unfortunately. But available have been a lot of older games
which were bad to receive over here for years, e.g. No Second Price.

Maybe you remember those old days: No Second Price was first cracked by
Cynix, but only because this game was sold in the UK _before_ it was sold
over here... Well, I really was angry about this, because this was a great
title and I wanted to be the first putting his fingers on this game... so I
never cracked it then!

There was the French magazine ST MAGAZINE available at this show. This
really is a nice magazine which is very cheap to subscribe! Compared to
that very expensive and mostly not very well written German ATARI INSIDE
the French ST MAGAZINE is a good alternative! The only problem is: It¥s in
French! (now you know how it feels to have an atari and not be born in
Germany perhaps! ;-) /Phx)

OK, but the most impressive thingy on the fair have been the HADES with the
ethernet-connections and the plugged in PC-card which did enable the
computer to run PC and Atari-software simultanously, and of coz: The MILAN.
The MILAN is a new ATARI-compatible computer which looks like a PC and even
the motherboard looks like a PC¥s one! It looks definitively VERY clean and
stable this little system! Michael Schwingen and another guy are
responsible for it. The motherboard looks more than a PC-motherboard than
an ATARI one: there¥s 4 PCI-slots, 3 ISA slots, an Intel (!) PCI-to-ISA
bridge chip, two EIDE controllers, a floppy-controller and PS/2 SIMM banks
which will hold 60 ns EDO RAMs only, because the 68040 in this system
accesses them in full steam power with 33 Mhz while internally it¥s running
with 66 Mhz. Optionally the system will work with an 68060, but not at this
time of development!! The system displays video through a standard PCI TRIO
V64 gfx-card and the sound will be done using a Soundblaster 16, the
standard-card on PC. It¥s planned to build DSP-cards for full
Falcon-compatibility, PC-card and more.

In December, the developers want to show a fully working MILAN on the
PARIS-ATARI show. Actually, the MILAN uses a patched TOS 2.06, but the
machine in PRIS will then contain a modified TOS 4.04 which is on FLASH-ROM
which makes it easy to be updated to a newer TOS or other system. The
built-in GLUE chips on the MILAN¥s motherboard are programmable using some
kind of cable-connector(?), also. So it¥s even possible to make the MILAN
more compatible to ATARI-computers by updating the "hardware" in the GLUEs!

I need clarifying possible misunderstandings: The MILAN will not be a fully
compatible ATARI-system. You will not be able playing your old games from
the ST or STE, but you will be able to run all Atari-software which is
68040 compatible and which is made for GEM or Magic. I think that all
software which works with the MagicPC or MagicMAC or TOS2WIN emulators will
for sure work on the MILAN, too! Games which only work with PacifiST
Emulator will most pro-bably have no chance to work on the Milan. Main
reason is that the original ATARI-video-hardware is not rebuilt in the
MILAN, but exchanged with a faster one.

In my eyes, the MILAN is a promising system which really is worth to be
considered as an alternative to your existing and slow-being ATARI TT. The
price of the MILAN should be lower than the HADES costs.

This was a short overview over the ATARI-Fair in NEUSS. Read longer
articles in printed medias for more information, please! But this must be,
I bet, one of the first reports from that show which will be readable for
more than a fistful of people.

BTW, lots of scene-people have also been at the fair, e.g. Jacky, Bandit,
Stratagem, Daryl, Marc Rosocha, SuperGAU, Matt, Teddy and so on..

[4] Inter Jam '97 Results
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a _very_ quick and tiny little report from Inter Jam '97 party held
in Karlsruhe, Germany this weekend. Hopefully we'll be able to present a
little bit more extensive report in a few days, we'll see!

In short words there was 87 people attending, 4 of them was girls and one
"whatever", the rest was boys for some weird reason. 60 litres of Cola, 10
bags of trash! ;-)

No Atari entries except for graphix and musix, the results of those are
below, there was 4 PC intro and 2 PC demo entries, only one Atari intro
which was not released. This was mainly a party for having fun and meet
people, not to be productive as the compo entries tells...

[6] Das ATOS Magazine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a German ST-Guide/HTML magazine named ATOS available on the World
Wide Web. It's been around for quite some time, but I still think it
deserves to be mentioned as lots of people don't seem to know about it!

This is not a scene magazine or anything like that, but a real serious
magazine with professional reviews of software and high quality articles.
There's only one thing which is wrong with it, it's all in german! Please
send them emails and complain and tell them to translate future issues to
english so everyone can read it!

In the current issue (which always is available for online browsning) the
following topics are to be read about....

Atari-Messe Neuss, GIGAFUN-Convention 97, Twilight 2.07, Schon_me, qed
4.00, TOS2WIN 2.00, Freedom 2, Thing, Fenix, Milan, TAE-Anschluﬂtechnik

[8] Apple To Slash Notebook Prices
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple Computer is set to drastically slash prices on some PowerBook
notebook computers by as much as $1,000 as it makes way for updated
notebooks with the recently announced PowerPC 750 processor. How low can
they go?

[9] Sun to Unveil 600-MHz Chip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Microsystems (SUNW) today unveiled a new generation of processors that
could reach upward of 600 MHz by next year, topping Intel in the chip
performance game.

The new UltraSparc-III is the third generation of the Sparc family of
