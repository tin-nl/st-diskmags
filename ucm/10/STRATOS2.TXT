                                STraTOS vol. 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bonjour... erm... hello freax, fanatics, survivors...
Today I will write a little review of the new french CD-magazine called STraTOS
because instead of the good old ST-MAGAZINE I've bought this one at my holidays
in France. I have vol. two and this  means  July/August. Hum, because  I was in
October in France I was a little bit surprised... is it dead, dleayed or what?
It doesn't matter. I was  running around  at several  shops and finally  I have
found this one and for only 40 FF (about 13,50 DM) you  can get  a  A5-magazine
with about 70 pages and a CD-ROM  full with  stuff. And so I've bought it, even
if I don't have a CD-ROM-drive...
Ok, at first I will take a look at the paper-magazine...
Hum. There is one big problem... it's written in french... hem... but what are
you waiting for? It's a french  publication. And  so you need  at least a small
knowledge of this language  and a good  dictionary to  read it  or at  least to
understand some parts of it. Ok, I have both things on the hand and in the head
and so I will start the review of the contents...
Before I start here some facts  about the mag itself. It's printed in black and
white with some coloured  pages. It's released  by a firm called NO'MAD. All in
one it seems to be at least  semi-professional... cool for a  young magazine in
comparison with the first issues of other mags (like ATARI INSIDE...)
At first there  are a lot  of news  included. A  few are  Atari-related (what's
going on with  ATARI GAMES... their latest  projects..., some information about
EXA's game "K" for the Falcon... new  Jaguar-games... AFTERBURNER  with  80 MHz
and other stuff) and the most  from the big  world of Computers (new DSP-chips,
news from INTEL and MOTOROLA and others...).
The mag goes on  with a  course for  PAPYRUS, a short  report of  the "VOLCANIC
PARTY 3" (do you remember? You  can find some  stuff about it in an older issue
of  the UCM... hehe...) with some pictures from different french scene-guys =),
do-it-yourself-instructions  for connecting  an OLIVETTI-monitor  to the Jaguar
(hursch...), some pages about coding  in GFA and Assembler (Bitplane-stuff with
source-codes, Fractal-compression  and loads more) followed by C++-stuff... all
in all 16 pages... horrible!
The mag goes on with a little HTML-course (grafix-composition), another course
and this time for  NEON GRAFIX, a review of the  EB MODELER for POV 3, a little
article for how to design some buttons... (erm...).
Ok, furthermore  there is a  big article  about BeOS (another operating-system,
for PowerPC), a short article about  the PaCifiST (the  mag on  the CD-ROM runs
under this  emulator also on PC...) and  a review of the PILOT, another pocket-
machine based on the MC 68000. Seems to be some kind of a notepad or so...
It follows a comparison of SYQUEST EZ DRIVE 135 and the ZIP DRIVE 100.
And of course a big review of the CENTURBO 1 EVOLUTION 3 is included.
Last articles  are reviews of  CONNECT 2.46, CAB 1.5 (erm... a bit old eh?), an
introduction in the world of modem  and IRC, an  interview with a  guy which is
unknown to me... and the usual review of some shareware-stuff.
The mag features also  adverts and so  one (also for EXA's "K" including a very
promising screen-shot).
Hum... masses of information but  nearly indigestible  because of  the language
and so I will go over to the CD...
On the CD you will find  at first a 300 MB (!!!) big  interactive magazine with
loads of  video-clips, like  action-scenes  from the  latest  Jaguar-games, two
TV-spots for  the Jaguar from the United States (AVP and DOOM), another TV-spot
from the french channel CANAL+ with screens from demos, tools and games...
But all  in one this  magazine isn't very  interesting. Ok, it runs on all TOS-
based machines and also on  the PaCifiST, but  the shell is very shitty and for
not french  speaking people  the whole  thing is  a very big mysterie. BTW. the
shell of the mag isn't very well coded, ok, is colourfull and looks ok, but its
fucking slow.
The stuff on the CD isn't the best and you will find the most things on all the
other compacts around. There are only a few really new releases on  it and esp.
the  demos are in part horrible  old (do you remember "GROTESQUE"?!). But  I've
found  also  some interesting  on it, also  older things, but  shows  that  the
connections between the  whole countries aren't the best... The tools and games
on the CD are also more or less superfluous.
Conclusion... this  mag is only a thing for french speaking people, because the
most interesting thing seems to be the paper-magazine. The CD doesn't bring too
much stuff for the money and so only hardcore-collectors should buy it.
