                        POLISH AND CZECH ST DEMO STUFF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Last time you read in the  UCM about the surviving ST scene in Poland.
Unfortunately I must say that it's fucking hard to get these demos! Anyway here
are four  of them including one  which was released at the Orneta 97 party last
summer. Here we go.

    Actually as I told you it's so difficult to find news  from Poland that you
sometimes  discover old  stuff you had  never heard  of before : e.g. this demo
compil was released in 1994 (yes !!) by some guy called Van Eijk...

    The introduction screen is a fullscreen displayed  with some scrolltexts, a
dots flag and a  nice soundtrack. Nothing to add... Then  there's a loader that
consists in a dots object along with 2 scrolltexts but in Polish! Can you speak
Polish?? I can't!! Btw  we've got  now another  soundtrack and... yes! This one
was ripped from one of my favorite ST games: Turrican II. Greaaaaaaat!

    The first screens  feature some dots effects. Quite  nice even though there
is not  much of "pure" code. All  these fx  are  displayed  in a larger window,
there's no lower  border. The following  screens feature precalculated morphing
sequences. Not so stunning... Again you can try to learn to read Polish because
there  are a few texts. Another  dot object comes, looks strange but nice. Then
we see blue sinus waves in a small window, 3D  keftales (really don't know  how
to  describe it  sorry!). Time for  some greetings, still  in Polish and that's
over...

    Not exactly! The last  screen, my  favorite, is a  fullscreen TV test card,
you know that kind of coloured stuff shown  when all the programs are over. And
I really love this screen! It's full of flashy colors and the ATARI name in the
middle  of it is a cool idea. I'd love to get it as a screen saver!

    Eventually, even  though this is not a state of  the art demo, I think it's
worth getting  it. The overall design  is nice, the tunes  sound nice too and I
loooove  the  TV effect. But  I wonder why  there are  no handmade  gfx? I know
there are lots of talented graphists in Poland so why not include their gfx??

    Now we  change year: no not  1997 yet, we have  reached 1995! I  can't even
remember how I managed to get this demo from the Czech Republic and therefore I
was surprised to notice it hadn't been tested in the UCM...

    The first  original effect  comes  with  the intro. Pictures  take suddenly
shape  from "big  pixellised  squares" to  their  final  state. It's  a kind of
reverted  zoom, see  what I mean?? Anyway  it looks great and  the gfx are good
too! The loader is another weird thing as it's a wire framed bridge that you're
walking  on. And sometimes  it stops  and you  enter a  screen. This part isn't
impressive, maybe they could have had filled 3D, no??

    But  the  following  screen  is  rather  disappointing: an overscan picture
representing a  Falcon along  with a  moving text. Hum.... Back  to the  bridge
(sings the song). Next is a  realtime zoomer. It's really slow  even though the
gfx (ripped  pics converted from spectrum  format) are nice. It includes a  few
other fx, distorted pics and so on. With a  little  of optimization it could be
great! A rotating  starfield  then appears (after the  bridge stuff) mixed with
other zooming pics... Pfouuu I'm getting bored.

    Violet rasters take half the screen and two Wolfenstein logos, mapped on an
invisible  sphere, come toward us. It's  smooth until it grows  too big 8-) Two
Doom logos arrive and combine with the other ones: pretty messy, isn't it? Once
again it's too  slow to be  impressive... Other spheres replace the logos. They
are composed of a pic and the name of a  member of the band. An original way to
introduce the staff! But too slow again.

    Hellraiser (the horror  movie character) appears with a text reading "ST is
not dead". Yep  sir! Then  there's  a loooong  loading and... can  you hear the
music? It's  a  sample  of  a  Jerry  Lee  Lewis  song! Waoouuuh... erm... It's
accompanied by a text  with zooming letters (they really love zooms!) and a few
flat objets that are rotating. The final part is a text and you'll be  happy to
hear that you can choose your langage... Personally I picked up english because
I'm not so good at Czech 8-)

    The overall is satisfaying: ok  there's nothing  revolutionnary  but it's a
good start and I really like some of their ideas. I must also add  that this is
one of the few prods that contains gfx even though half are ripped! By the time
you read  this Headache Project  should have  release their  racing game called
Power Up. It looks like Supercar but the animation should be higly improved I'm
afraid.

    This is another  prod from Poland  for 1Mb  STes only this time. I think it
was released last year (not so old 8-). The intro is just the typical one  with
the team logo and the name of the demo.

    The first  effect is  a  dots  landscape  as  you can  see it  in  the  old
BrainDamage/Aggression or Blood/Holocaust. The 3D  rotate part isn't new either
as it features some  wire-framed  objets  rotating  and changing shape. You can
notice  all objects are "lightsourced" and  that gives  the screen a nice depth
impression. The 2D function pattern screen is awfully  boring, it's kinda slide
show of dull keftales - in black and white besides. No way to skip it. Pressing
space won't  spare you (I know, I've tried it 8---). But I  like the  ratrayced
INTEL OUTSIDE!

    A few dots object moving around like the  endpart of the Faith demo by Dune
and we  go on. Next is  a mapped bar, with  a cloudy sky texture I think. As it
rotates  and comes closer, it grows bigger. It's a pity all the same that there
are a few bugs!

    Then we have  what they call "3D  CAD  objects". Hum to me they are just 3D
objects with zebra filling (is that the good name for it?) like the  old Mental
Hangover  demo. It's really  nice but  not so smooth  I'm afraid. Oh... great a
fractal generator!!! And  once again  I can't skip  it, argh I'm gonna die this
time!

    Big 3D  shapes (a cube, then  a  sphere  and  so  on...) fly  around with a
different  color on  each side. Great  but  why does  it run  in 2  VBLs?? Oups
sorry... More wire framed stuff come next, morphing and then disappearing.

    Another dots  stuff? Yep but  this one  is a 3D  blue and white Cube that's
rotating. There's a  nice motive painted  on each  side: a  face, an  insect...
Really cool. Last but  not least the Gouraud part. Gouraud textured objects pop
out and come closer, always moving. I just regret they're a little too dark. We
won't spend  much time on the last screen, a "THE ENd" logo that must have been
drawn by some PC owner (quite ugly yes).

    Final comments: this  is a rather  nice combination  of old and new fx even
though some optimization is still needed! I forgot to tell you about the zik, a
slow soundtrack, quite  good but  common. Again there are  almost no  real gfx,
except in the intro and the Intel Outside logo, and I think Polish bands should
really  think about  this point. Otherwise  the whole  stuff is pleasant to the
eye.

    This demo is  quite recent since  it was released last summer at the Orneta
97'. Actually  it even came  3rd in the intro compet! Other demos were released
there but  are not  available yet, eg  the Yoyo intro  or the surely great Amok
demo (that ranked first). This intro was downloaded from the Inet where you can
find an Orneta 97 site at http://wombat.ludvika.se/~ae/orneta.

    But I must warn  you now, this intro  is pure shit!! Ok it runs in high res
(why?) but that's  the only  original  thing  about  it... This  piece  of crap
features  texts, texts  and only  texts along  with a chip tune. Because of the
high  resolution  every scrolling is  so lame that  you really wonder if it's a
joke or what! But to me the worst of all are the texts  themselves : "The ST is
dead", "Fuck Atari", "Buy a PC" and  so on... I  just wanted  to crush  my disk
with dis  garbage on it!! Now  I'm wondering  wether it was  a sample of Polish
sense  of  humor or  a  kind of "Bill-Gates-Rules-The-World" propaganda. Anyway
don't even waste your time to get this stuff.


<------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hopefully I should be able to bring you fresh stuff next time including a
   test of THE demo: RESURRECTION! See ya
