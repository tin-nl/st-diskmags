INTERVIEW with: SKINHEAD/I.C.S.                        Done by: MC LASER/.tSCc.

===============================================================================

Hello Skinhead!

When we  all thought  that I.C.S. is  vanished  from the  playground  something 
really cool has happened. You have released your CD-ROM called 'ATARI ST Pirate 
Gold Vol. 1'. Well, we'll  speak  later bout  that. Some  guys also know you as 
L0N$DALE of VECTRONIX (Original supplier).


UCM:   First tell us a little bit of your history. How did you start computing. 
       What groups you were in and why you are using the I.C.S. banner  instead 
       of the VEX Label?

SH:    Well ok, I started  computing like  everybody  my age with  those little
       LCD-Screen  handhelds, then a  bit later a  ATARI VCS 2600 (the real one
       with the brown wood), one  year later (don't  ask me what year that was)
       I bought  an  ATARI 800 XL, I  had no  software  for  half a year or so, 
       because I (small as I was) had no money to afford a datasette. So  later 
       I had a datasette and even more later a floppy, but courious as it is, I 
       never  met  anyone else  owning an XL, so I only had original games, and 
       some  very  good  ones  like 'Schreckenstein'  or  'Tank  Commander' for 
       example (somebody remembers that stuff?). Unfortunately I sold my XL for 
       some foul reason, nowdays I'm sorry about that. 
       So that was my computing start...about other groups well...they were all 
       too  lame to  be  mentioned  here, about  using  my ICS alias instead of 
       L0n$dale...well I  released my  CD-Rom under the ICS label because there 
       was  already a Vectronix CD  done by someone else, so I thought it would 
       be much nicer if I'd make a CD out of my own with my old handle.


UCM:   Now to your CD-ROM. How long did it take to finish this CD?

SH:    Pheew...I really don't remember, but it took  more than a  year, and the
       idea about a CD-Rom  like that was  lurking for  quite a long time in my
       insaine head. It was hard  work, but I  liked doing it, and I think it's
       noticeable to everyone who has this disc, that I worked hard on it.


UCM:   When can we expect Vol. 2 of your pirate CD-Series?

SH:    I would like to  do Volume 2 again with  ST Games stuff only, and I want
       to do a full CD-release again, so  I wont release it before I don't have
       atleast 640 Megs  together. When I  write  this I  have around  150 megs
       together in something like 400 games. So this can still take a while...


UCM:   How many copies do you have sold from your CD?

SH:    Hehe...I don't remember. I burnt  it two times, something like 18 pieces
       or so  exist  officially, but  ofcourse  there  have been  made 'pirate' 
       copies of this  product by some people...for example I know that someone
       send my CD to the programmer of Pacifist...


UCM:   I don't know if the crowd is really interested in this one but let's try 
       it. How old are you now?

SH:    Haha...yes, a really boring question but I'm 23.



UCM:   What kind of machines do you own?

SH:    ATARI TT 030 8  megs ST-RAM / 4 megs  Fastram  hooked  up  with: 50 megs 
       Seagate HD, 1 gig Quantum Fireball HD, Syquest 88 megs changeable media, 
       Toshiba 6,7x CD-Rom, USR  Dual Standard  x2 Modem, old STAR LC-10 colour 
       printer, a shitty Belinea S-VGA monitor and an Eprom-burner.
       520 STE 1 meg, several  3 1/2 and one 5 1/4 external drives, a SM 146, a 
       SC1435 a 520 STM with 1 meg and a TOS-switch, a 1040 STFM with 2.5 mega, 
       a Lynx 2, a  Jaguar with  CD-Rom (US model), and  a  Portfolio. I  think 
       that's  about it, and  yes I don't have a fuckin' PC! Oops...I forgot my 
       Philips CM 8833 monitor...


UCM:   What is your fave game for the ST?

SH:    Hm....I like Turrican 2, Wing of Death 1+2, Roadwar 2000, Dungeon Master 
       and  lotsa  other stuff, not  easy  to say. My  fave  game on Falcon was 
       Transarctica, maybe because I never managed to solve it...on the Lynx it
       is Super Skweek and on the Jag it's ofcourse AvP.


UCM:   What is your fave demo for ST?

SH:    Again a very naughty question...maybe Grotesque, maybe Braindamage...


UCM:   I know  that you  were involved  in the  phreaking scene. Is there today
       really no possibility to call for free?

SH:    Ofcourse there is, but you have to be  quite a  crack to manage to break
       the r2 system...maybe  they already got  something else  I don't know...
       and ofcourse  there are still  calling-cards  available, but  I'm not so 
       crazy to do any of that  stuff anymore, because the guys  will trace you
       and have you busted before you have even finished your call.


UCM:   What interests do you have apart from computing? Fave music for example.

SH:    I do collect  real freaked  out movies  on Laserdisc, like  Braindead or
       Evil Dead or all kind  of that  movies. Yes  and I do  collect miniature
       cars (stop laughing!). About music...well The Prodigy  seemed  nice, but
       their new album is crap! And I'm a hetero, so I do like girls...


UCM:   Please give us a short comment on following topics.

ATARI         -     Dumb management, but I still like to use their stuff.

FALCON        -     I used to have one, but sold it coz of the shitty scene.

AMIGA         -     Don't like 'em... 

PC & MS       -     hate 'em... 

DEMOS         -     Nice to look at... 

SCENE         -     Is there a real scene left? The old days were fun...

CRACKING      -     Hehe...crack  em all, old  fave saying  by  MCA...well some
                    people  say that  cracking destroyed  the Atari, but that's
                    bullshit coz the user  needs to buy originals, that keeps a 
                    machine  alive, not  the craptalk  about crack destroys the 
                    scene...

INTERNET      -     Place for lamers... 

JAGUAR        -     Good machine, again shit management! 

PLAYSTATION   -     Good machine, good management!

NINTENDO 64   -     Maybe it'll sell out PSX? 

VECTRONIX     -     ...lazy  people who  sun themselves  in  their old  success 
                    dreams.

ELITE         -     cool guys, do you know that  Sledge was the  first european
                    to ever call an US Atari Elite board? Don't know any of the 
                    new members... 

DISKMAGS      -     Good articles, good mag - Shit articles, shit mag!


UCM:   Have you any last words for the Atari-public?

SH:    I need some  old games, if anybody  got a list or some Disks to giveaway 
       (with games!) get in touch!
       Nothing else comes into my mind...see ya all around!
       (I'm  willing to  stay on  Atari until  the  end, let's  see who's still 
       around after 2000...)

Many thanx for spending your time for us. C u l8r.
