                   Interview with Simon Sunnyboy of Paradize
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UCM .... Hi Matthias! Since  you are  around  for some time  on the  IRC now and
         even entered a  new band, it's time to check out, who you  are and what
         do you do in the Atari scene. So just tell us at first, something about
         yourself, what  are you doing  if you're not hanging around on IRC  and
         playing around with Atari?

ÒSunny .. My name is Matthias Arndt  and I'm  now 24 years old. I  come from  the
Ò         northern  part  of   Germany  and   I'm  currently   studying  business
Ò         informatics at the technical university Clausthal-Zellerfeld.
Ò         In the scene  and to my  friends, I'm  known  as "Simon Sunnyboy" which
Ò         substituted my old nick "Arcade King" that I used for many years on the
Ò         ST. I'm more of a shy guy and I'm not the one to take to the next rave.
Ò         I wouldn't like it. Although I really appericate chiptunes and music on
Ò         the ST, I  hate all kind  of electronic  music otherwise. I  prefer old
Ò         style rock'n'roll, blues, country, boogie-woogie and western swing.
Ò         Actually a  real wild  piano like the  one of Jerry Lee Lewis  makes me
Ò         mad. I can listen  to these kinds  of music all the  time without  ever
Ò         wanting anything else.
Ò         My interests  beside  Atari are  old computers  in  general, emulation,
Ò         programming, GNU/Linux, microcontrollers, astronomy, rocketry and space
Ò         sciences, history, rock'n'roll  music and its associated films, artists
Ò         and protagonists. I like good science fiction movies, teeny movies like
Ò         American Pie, all James Bond movies with "Moonraker" being my favourite
Ò         episode, and war movies like "Das Boot" and "The Longest Day".
Ò         My favourite TV sitcoms are "Married with Children" and "Roseanne".
Ò         There's only one thing missing for me and that's a kind girlfriend.

UCM .... Please tell  us a bit  more about  your steps  that brought  you to the
         point to enter  the scene as someway active member. What brought you to
         the point to say: he, I wanna be part of this strange microcosm.

ÒSunny .. Steps? Well, I wanted  to take part  from the day  my brother showed me
Ò         the first  steps in programming. That  was way back  in 1990. I was ten
Ò         years old and  my brother was really  pissed off that I annoyed him all
Ò         day to play games on the ST.
Ò         I don't really  know what motivated  him but I guess he wanted me to do
Ò         something  more useful than playing games. All I ended up with was that
Ò         I learned programming  to do games  on my own. I used a lot of  type in
Ò         games to learn from them. One  reason that  forced that whole thing was
Ò         my lack of  contacts. All my friends  had an Amiga with new games every
Ò         three weeks. I only  had the good  old 520ST with  only a single  sided
Ò         drive at that time and no contacts to other ST users.
Ò         If you don't  get new games  as a little  boy and  you want to play new
Ò         stuff, then you go start coding. Although GFABASIC only, I learned many
Ò         things with it.
Ò         Taking part in  the real scene so is just the final step. Infact I just
Ò         want to  express my love for  the Atari ST and  to take  part. I do not
Ò         want to be on top nor do I want to beat them all.

UCM .... What are your  main interests on the ST. I know you were playing around
         in game development a little bit and then you tried to code some little
         demo effects. So please tell us.

ÒSunny .. Playing games and developing them. Demos are impressive but for me they
Ò         only are demonstrations of what can be done.
Ò         A good game  uses techniques  like those used in demos. Lethal Xcess is
Ò         an excellent example for that.
Ò         Coding  demo effects  is  my way  to learn about  the ST in detail. The
Ò         intended  goal is  to use this  knowledge for  coding  games. My  first
Ò         released intro called "The Debut" is an an example for that, I tested a
Ò         few techniques for game programming in it.
Ò         I'm  a  supporter  of  Atari ST  emulation  as  well. I  use  emulators
Ò         frequently and I support the emulation community without having strange
Ò         feelings  with that. Without  emulation  the scene  would  be even more
Ò         obscure and more underground.
Ò         My interests in that direction concentrate on the ST emulator Hatari at
Ò         the moment. I help with debugging it and I write the user manual for it
Ò         which is available since summer of 2003 in the Hatari CVS.
Ò         I betatest  the  Linux version  of STEEM as  well  and  I maintain  the
Ò         Makedisk  tutorial to help the emulation addicts with playing the games
Ò         on a real machine. I actually  betatested and  helped debugging  the PC
Ò         Joystick support in XSTEEM for Russel.
Ò         At the  moment, I  have  a  1040STFM  at home  for  gaming  and  casual
Ò         developing  and a Falcon here  in Clausthal although  the latter one is
Ò         gathering dust as I don't have the time to do specific stuff with it at
Ò         the moment. From  time to time I  watch demos with it or test out Atari
Ò         related software, For development and trying out I rely on emulators as
Ò         I don't have the space to keep my 1040 here.
Ò         I use Hatari and STEEM most of the time both under Linux. Although from
Ò         time to time  the Falcon assists while coding and ofcourse I use it for
Ò         compatibility tests.
Ò         I'm planning  on getting an STE though as it is easier to upgrade  with
Ò         memory and  the additional hardware is nice too. That won't mean that I
Ò         stop doing STFM stuff. I'll never forget my roots n that respect.
Ò         Developping  is done  either  with  Devpac for  the assembler stuff and
Ò         GFABASIC for  other things. GFABASIC is  a nice language  and I have no
Ò         problems with promoting it as a good, easy to use and powerful language
Ò         on the ST.

UCM .... As far as  I know you joined  the new formed group "Construct Crew" for
         some  months and  lately have  left it again. What  were the reasons to
         join them and to leave it that fast again?

ÒSunny .. Reasons for  joining them/him? At  that time I  thought that  Cosmo was
Ò         willing to learn. I wanted to do that too and I still do. The point is,
Ò         he neither  wanted to learn from other people, he soon made enemies and
Ò         he was not willing to listen to other people me included.
Ò         When  he started  pissing off  the whole  scene on  DHS, I got  mad and
Ò         dropped all  connections for some  time. I cannot work with someone who
Ò         badmouths  the whole  Atari  scene just  because of  his personal short
Ò         comings.
Ò         But I  do not hate  him like STS does, he  might be a lamer but I'm too
Ò         and I must  admit Cosmo's music is quite ok. He agreed to do some music
Ò         as a member  of Stax for me so  at least his SID tunes will be heard in
Ò         my projects from time to time.

UCM .... I know that  you coded some  little intro for one of the Construct Crew
         menus but in  the end it wasn't  released. You told me as well that you
         wanted to create a little intro for ST later on, what happened to these
         projects?

ÒSunny .. The CC related stuff died with my connection to it, although I kept the
Ò         sources, I do  not plan to  use that stuff  except as a base of already
Ò         written code.
Ò         The intro  screen for  EIL #3 will probably finished someday. It is not
Ò         completely dropped although on ice at the moment.

UCM .... Your next  step was to  join  Paradize, formerly  known as "The Coolest
         Paradise". What brought you to this step?

ÒSunny .. Cooper of course. I  was a freelancer in the summer and Cooper just did
Ò         ask: "Hey, you wanna join?" And I did. I even didn't hesitate for long.
Ò         Cooper does GFA stuff too so I guess it is a perfect fit at the moment.
Ò         We  get  along well  and I  hope to  do many productions  for and  with
Ò         Paradize.

UCM .... How would you describe  the cooperation  in Paradize in comparison with
         the Construct Crew?

ÒSunny .. To be honest you  can't compare that properly. But it is definitly much
Ò         more rewarding  to work with Cooper. He has much better contacts to the
Ò         scene and I now have too. We can talk about anything and we often share
Ò         the same  opinion on  a subject. And  if we have  different opinions on
Ò         coding subject or on what project to do, it won't lead to trouble.
Ò         We just talk and it turns out not to impose problems. Cooperation is as
Ò         good as it can be. I'm really looking forward to meet Cooper someday.

UCM .... Paradize seemed  to motivate you a lot in the end, what projects are in
         the pipeline  after  your first  releases under  this label  and can we
         count on some stuff that features works by you and Cooper together?

ÒSunny .. Projects in  the pipeline? Ok, I'll  tell you  a few things but keep in
Ò         mind that  this is just a sketch of things that _could_ be done. I have
Ò         an almost finished  board game  called Penta in  the queue  which  will
Ò         likely  see the  light of day  at Outline 2004. Beside  that  I plan to
Ò         reactivate some more of my old games.
Ò         One is a  Vermeer clone  that hasn't  got a release  title yet. The old
Ò         development title is "AHA - Aktien, Handel, Auktionen".
Ò         Another thing is some sort of turnbased strategy based in France in the
Ò         Hundred Years War. It currently is simply called "France 1429".
Ò         Beside  games I'll probably  do a contribution  for  Outline 2004. What
Ò         exactly ain't  clear yet but it will probably something for the Fake or
Ò         Wild Demo category.
Ò         Then  there  is  the  Atari-Forum demo  project  but  that  is  more  a
Ò         participative project for the members of Atari-Forum.
Ò         As a final throw we plan a GFABASIC megademo but except of the idea and
Ò         some prelimary work don't expect anything on that before summer.
Ò         Although these  are mine ideas I'm looking forward to do parts together
Ò         with Cooper.

UCM .... With your  time in  the  Construct Crew  you were able  to see that the
         scene  isn't  always a  very comfortable place  and  somehow, newcomers
         could  have a hard  time. What  do you  think about the nowadays  Atari
         scene? What  do you think about those quarrels around your former group
         on the BBS and in the IRC?

ÒSunny .. The scene is  great and  it is not  only a pleasure  but a honour to be
Ò         part of it. I  come along very well with all of the members as far as I
Ò         have met and  talked to them yet. All were very kind and helpful in the
Ò         beginning. Everything  has something  to do  with  the  way  you  treat
Ò         people. If you  treat them with  respect and honour like I do you don't
Ò         have problems. Nobody ever bashed me as long as I'm on IRC and DHS.
Ò         People even  show interest if I  explain my point  of view in the games
Ò         department  for example. The Atari platform ain't dead and the scene is
Ò         not only a vital part but it is one of the reasons for me to keep Atari
Ò         in my  heart. I've met so many nice people here that I'd really miss it
Ò         if I'd be forced to leave again.
Ò         I don't like to comment here any further on the Construct Crew. Leaving
Ò         it should be signal enough.

UCM .... What about  ASM Software, your  label. Why you  decided to release your
         stuff  under this  label and not  under your  nickname? And why ASM? Is
         there any deeper meaning behind those letters?

ÒSunny .. ASM Software is the label I used for a long time and I still do. All of
Ò         my Atari ST programs until now were intended for the ASM Software label
Ò         although  beside  "Megastar", "Blackjack" and  a  few  small  utilities
Ò         nothing has been released sofar.
Ò         Actually ASM Software was a shareware label for sometime, mainly on the
Ò         PC and  without success. ASM  was a nifty short label for me in the old
Ò         times. It hadn't  had a meaning until  I got asked what it could mean a
Ò         few years ago.
Ò         ASM  Software  stands  for  Asymetric Simple Microprocessor   SOFTWARE,
Ò         meaning  that  we   mainly  produce   software  for  various  kinds  of
Ò         microprocessors including Intel x86 and Motorola 68000 architecture.
Ò         Asymetric in  the term  of  not  being a  commercial label  and without
Ò         schedule. It is a pure fun thing.
Ò         And as ASM Software is doing serious stuff as well, especially for GNU/
Ò         Linux, I will  not release software  under a nickname and using the ASM
Ò         Software label. Either  it is Matthias Arndt  for ASM Software or Simon
Ò         Sunnyboy for Paradize but not mixed.

UCM .... What are your  dreams for your near future in the Atari scene? Have you
         anything in mind you would like to do or to do with someone together?
         No real plans, just your dreams...

ÒSunny .. Dreams? Atari related  dreams only include doing my first polished game
Ò         project that is neither buggy nor ugly like Megastar. I never said that
Ò         Megastar looked like Lethal Xcess :D
Ò         As I already  found a crew  I have no more  Atari related dreams beside
Ò         that. Getting an STE but that's all.

UCM .... Ok... we  have  nearly  reached  the  end. If  you  want  to send  some
         greetings or if  you have some message to the readers, you now have the
         possibility to write it down.

ÒSunny .. I'm  proud  to  take  part in  the Atari scene  and I'm  really looking
Ò         forward to do  more stuff on the ST. For  greetings just take a look at
Ò         our Website Intro. Nothing big but most people who deserve my greetings
Ò         are listed there.
Ò         If you don't know our website yet, check http://paradize.atari.org/ and
Ò         feel free to leave us a comment in the guestbook.

UCM .... Thanx for  your patience  and I hope we  run over your name in the near
         future in the Atari scene from time to time...
