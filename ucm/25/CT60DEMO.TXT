                          EVOLUTION - "EVOLUTION 1.o"
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

system .. Falcon with at least a 68o4o CPU, designed to run on CT6o

Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The longer  the wait  for the ct60 was, the  shorter it  was for  a special ct60
demo. Sure, "Evolution 1.0" is  just a relative short intro, but it is exclusive
for the ct60... this means it  is just  running on  68040 or higher cpus, but to
get a good speed, you'll need your 060Falcon.

When starting the demo, you first get an ASCII menu, where you can select the Hz
and quality, on my 66 Mhz CT60 100 Hz VGA runs fine, other options are 60 Hz RGB
or VGA and  50 Hz RGB, a  switch  between  high  and  low detail-level  is  also
possible.

The intro begins  with a moving mirror effect  which looks very nice, after that
you see a  moving 3-D  writing "evolution" and "dhs". The  text  is  moving VERY
smooth over the screen but is not very colourful.
The following 3-d and textured objects are moving and turning in front of a nice
drawn "finished" Mortal Combat combatant, 18+, if you know what I mean ;-)

The next  part, a jumping  3-d ball in  a kind  of 3-d "castle" is  my favourite
effect, it is simple, but has something fascinating, it is followed by my second
favourite: a  morphing  cube, also  very, very  smooth  and  nice  coloured, but
nothing you need a ct60 for...

A kind  of textured snake, or  two rings  holding  each other  are the next one,
followed by a short writing which is also the end of this short demo...
Just as long as a good song has to be ;-)

ÒMy conclusion: In  this  intro  you  won't  find  any  really  new  effects, but
Ò               everything is  running smooth and the effects are innovative, for
Ò               example  the  jumping ball  in the  3-D environment, or  the nice
Ò               drawn background picture...
Ò               The music  is also  very good, it  is a mod  file  playing in the
Ò               background, but the quality is very clear, just as mp2.
Ò               Sure, this short but good quality proggy is not a reason to buy a
Ò               ct60 (if there is a second run), but  it shows  the world  a very
Ò               exclusive  product for 150 proud ct60 users and of course it is a
Ò               step in the  right direction, because  good software  lets  other
Ò               good software grow, it is a question of honour and maybe a result
Ò               of this would be a ct60 exclusive game... we just t can hope ;-)

                                                       Cheers, Chris (MacFalcon)
