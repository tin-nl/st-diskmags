                     Today on the hot seat: STsurvivor (?)

UCM ... Hi Seb, hope you  don't feel so  uncomfortable getting interviewed by me
        for UCM, so how are you?

ÒSeb ... Hi Eric! There is no problem with me if you want to waste some time with
Ò        me but I hope you have more interesting interviews for your readers :) I
Ò        would like to point  out that I cannot wait  to read this  issue of UCM,
Ò        reading your own stuff a hundred  times tends to  bore you to death. I'm
Ò        feeling ok tho  really tired these days with work but  relieved now that
Ò        I've managed to kick out another issue of ALIVE!
Ò        I didn't want  all this work and above all the efforts of our supporters
Ò        to sleep any longer on my harddrive. But I feel really sorry that Defjam
Ò        couldn't deliver  his intro though I waited 10 days while this issue was
Ò        already completed :( I hope Defjam finishes his intro but hopes are very
Ò        low and that's very sad...


UCM ... The reason to  catch you for a little interview are the things you wrote
        in the latest Alive issue, about  quitting and  so  on. Even though  you
        already explained your  views there, let me ask you if you feel bit  sad
        now, that you wrote this?

ÒSeb ... I don't feel sad nor embarrassed for all I've said or written, I already
Ò        wrote too  much crap in  my life :) Of course  I'm VERY sad that history
Ò        repeats: first I left Toxic Mag, then UCM and now ALIVE... As for UCM it
Ò        was different  tho, I simply  didn't like the idea of taking your  royal
Ò        seat :)
Ò        ALIVE was and still is my beloved baby, with heavy help and support from
Ò        CIH and I  strongly believe it's not the  end yet, well CiH  and Cyclone
Ò        seem willing to go on and that's good news to me !


UCM ... Have  you informed  the other Alive  chaps before  you did this  step? I
        guess they may not be afraid to read that stuff in the magazine.

ÒSeb ... Well the ALIVE team has been  reduced over the  last issues, others were
Ò        already busy with their  lives so  that mainly CiH and CXT were informed
Ò        of my decision. I also discussed the topic with other fellows and all of
Ò        them seemed  to understand  my move, tho they  showed  sadness (dunno if
Ò        they  burnt candles, prayed or cursed me in the end :).
Ò        I'm pretty sure  that CXT thought  I was being  depressed once again and
Ò        somehow I can't tell he was totally wrong.


UCM ... You mostly wrote that Alive may die with you leaving the magazine now.
        What about CIH? Don't you  think he can  get the magazine  alive? Do you
        regret this, to kick  the magazine into the grave even though the second
        main editor could go on?

ÒSeb ... Oh I guess I was misunderstood here and don't want  anyone to think that
Ò        ALIVE is nothing  without me! Surely  it's not much  without any kind of
Ò        help and CiH has ALWAYS been a great supporter  but I've always been the
Ò        one  working  on the  worst  part: harass  writers  and  supporters with
Ò        mailing  then collecting  and  reformating  stuff, finding  last  minute
Ò        replacements and so on. CiH has never handled the assembling process but
Ò        I know he  could do  it easily with  the proper instructions,  the way I
Ò        tried to do with Earx essential help.


UCM ... As you mentioned you may even use a new nickname, are you going to break
        completely with your past now?

ÒSeb ... Wee[r]do isn't a new nickname. I used it once for DHS Online Compo, back
Ò        in 2000 if I remember well when I  happened to  paint 2 piccies but with
Ò        very different  styles and  techniques. You're right tho, as I wanted to
Ò        break  with  my  past, but now  I've  decided  to  get back to  my  real
Ò        nickname because I'm still proud  of the small things I've managed to do
Ò        :) Besides, many  people  keep  calling  me STS. In the end, it makes no
Ò        sense to forget what you've done.


UCM ... And how do  you feel now, as  you closed  the Alive chapter, do you feel
        free or do you miss something? As I remember for myself I missed writing
        stuff a lot and after 1o  years editing magazines as you did, I guess it
        is quite strange to have not the mag editing pressure anymore.

ÒSeb ... It's too  early to say if I miss  it. What is a  certainty tho is that I
Ò        cannot say I enjoyed wasting my holidays on completing this issue. Still
Ò        I'm happy ALIVE (l)8 is released. At the moment, you can say I feel free
Ò        not only from  pressure but above all on the many extra hours after work
Ò        that every issue implies. Juggling between work  and another  issue that
Ò        gets delayed again and again isn't such a funny hobby :) The  absence of
Ò        pressure is nice! Besides I don't mean to get retired from the Scene yet
Ò        as I already  painted  some crap for  the  UCM  intro (while  completing
Ò        ALIVE). I'd like  to help  SWE to complete BARS is a nice  and addictive
Ò        puzzler and  I have other ideas in mind, yet I have to confess I want to
Ò        be lazy for some time now :)


UCM ... Yes, and what  do you think of the current state of the diskmag scene on
        Atari? All mags now have in common that the main editors write big parts
        of the mags alone, was this the main reason to stop for you, btw?

ÒSeb ... Not the main reason  for sure, but  I don't  enjoy reading  a mag with a
Ò        single  writer (no  offence meant  at your work). I still believe that a
Ò        mag needs  as many  different views as  one can  afford to bring  enough
Ò        flavour. CiH is a  greater writer than I am and I confess I didn't  read
Ò        all of his  articles before  releasing the mag, so that I could  read it
Ò        later and still find something new.
Ò        Decent reason for  quitting then? Hmm... Easy one : it  grabbed too much
Ò        of my little spare time and I'm tired of having almost no social life.
Ò        Growing older, still  being single, seeing so few friends, it's no life.
Ò        I hope it's  not  too late to catch up  with the real world  if there is
Ò        some room in it for someone like me (but in an asylum I mean! :).


UCM ... What do  you think, is  there a  chance to  see  you back  editing  some
        magazine or writing  some stuff for a mag? What changes the scene should
        make to get you back into the ring?

ÒSeb ... There's always  a chance for anything if you ask me :) Maybe I'll become
Ò        a top ASM coder  soon :) More  seriously, I don't consider going back to
Ò        editing  AT ALL at  the moment for the  reasons given above. I need some
Ò        time off and I think I simply deserve it. If CiH and CXT keep going with
Ò        ALIVE, then maybe  I can give  them a hand, as a  simple writer  tho and
Ò        nothing more. I don't  believe anyone will  move  his ass to  change the
Ò        situation  now: active  Sceners are perfectly aware that the lazy people
Ò        don't wake up. And if you want something done, better do it yourself.
Ò        That's  how the current  scene lives  on these  days, active people keep
Ò        being  active, while  lazy  people  keep  being lazy. Of  course there's
Ò        always more than the eye can see and I know some people are doing things
Ò        while they seem to be inactive. Future will tell then.


UCM ... What  future do  you  give  the current  diskmag scene, seen  from  your
        current point of view, being not active involved anymore.

ÒSeb ... Oh that question  is TOO easy: the diskmag Scene is DEAD! Sorry Eric but
Ò        you should know that reviewing stuff 6 months later isn't quite what you
Ò        can call fresh news... Chosneck is still going on, but I wonder how many
Ò        people  can read it since  ST users aren't allowed to, nor are  standard
Ò        Falcon users... This  is no  complaint  to  Grey, I'm  just wondering...
Ò        Going  online could  be a  solution  but it doesn't  fit the Fuji way of
Ò        thinking imho.


UCM ... Ok... that were the things that burned under my finger  nails, thanx for
        your patience  and if you want to leave a message for the crowd, you can
        do so now.

ÒSeb ... Were I still naive, I could  think that my quitting  could change things
Ò        but I'm not so  stupid :) It won't change  anything, except for me. Good
Ò        luck to you Chris  and Heinz, I hope to read new issues of ALIVE!
Ò        Last but not least I would like to tell people who have  started things,
Ò        that it  would be extremely cool if they completed them : Beams, Sprell,
Ò        Heftig and  god knows what else.
Ò        If you love the Scene, show it and  do something, nevermind if  it's big
Ò        or not, but  even a little something is a contribution. Doing nothing is
Ò        only consumption...

UCM ... Thanx, stay cool and much luck for the way you go now!
