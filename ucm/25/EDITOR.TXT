Sometimes they comeback...

Editorial

Hello  together, right  at  the beginning, I'm really glad  to be able  to write
another editorial, some  of you might  knew that this issue of UCM almost turned
into vapour ware, as it wasn't sure if it will ever see the light of day...
In fact I wanted  to kick all into  the trash after UCM 24 and the problems that
doing the  magazine nearly alone caused for my social life. As some of you might
know, my girlfriend  wasn't really  happy about the fact that I was sitting that
long  on the  machine, day by day, evening by evening, night by night, and  this
caused  some big  troubles... every normal thinking individual should understand
this...
That  was the point  for me to  change my mind  and if some people wouldn't have
kicked  my ass, this  UCM surely  would never be finished... so the first months
after the release of  issue 24, or better, the whole  summer, I didn't cared too
much about UCM anymore, the best thing to do at this time...

Last  autumn  several people  contacted me, asking  me about  UCM, and slowly my
Atari soul  came back to life, but  with several restrictions, such as computing
only if I was  in the right mood and without any pressure, as well as placing my
girlfriend  in the first  place again (as it should normally be... dumbass I was
before) leaving the Atari somewhere far behind.

Slowly growing  support in the  end turned UCM back into an active project, even
though it always seemed  to be the  same in the end, only a part of the promised
articles by  several people  arrived in the  end, and because I didn't wanted to
fill this  hole alone, the  development time was stretched more and more, now we
are speaking  of nine (!) months  since the last UCM... But over the most time I
was satisfied with the way I was going and how I was going it, just leaving room
for my  other interests  apart from  family life, that  means  sitting for hours
there and  using my free  time to play strategicals like "Stronghold" or "Sudden
Strike Forever"... but I needed those breaks...

Ofcourse the last  weeks I was mainly  oriented on finishing UCM and for several
days I stood on the edge of torture again, and believe me, I didn't liked it!
I don't want  to stay under that pressure anymore, as it turns me into a nervous
individual  and destroys  any bit of motivation  as it isn't fun anymore. I have
too much  other things to do  and in my  mind, that tormenting my mind about UCM
isn't  really  needed here... On  some of the  last days I even was short before
thinking "bah, lick my ass, this will be the last one...", and  so I  decided to
took some breaks  in development again, as I still think and hope that it wasn't
the last issue at all...

And I'm quite  satisfied with this issue, it contains more stuff to read for you
and a  marvellous  intro  and could  be the  first issue  of a new generation of
UCM's... More about this topic can be found in the article "The future of UCM"..
Just want to say... it lays also in your hands!

Anyway... it's time  to cut the crap  here, hope you  enjoy reading the stuff we
bring you here...

Stay cool - stay Atari...

PS... There were a  lot of words thrown  into the ring about a birthday special,
      but... somehow  I missed the  topic. An article about the last 1o years of
      UCM was  just slowly  growin as I really wasn't in the mood to do it... On
      the other  hand I wanted  to release a complete Atari related index of all
      UCM's done so far, I have to admit, I stopped on this after I included the
      issue 11 stuff and  the file was  grown up to 5o kb... I will release this
      index maybe in  the next issue  then, but  diving through all the old mags
      and memories is eating a lot of time I didn't have really...
