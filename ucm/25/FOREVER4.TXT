                      FOREVER 4 PARTY ATARI 8BIT RELEASES
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After fooling  around with ST and Falcon  stuff I thought, "Eh, let's check what
the 8bit Atarians  have done in the past months as "Numen" and the latest  demos
by the Quasimodos are  already covered  by dust again... so time to discover new
stuff...

The first  thing that came  up to my mind  was the all  years  happening Forever
party, that took place in spring this year. It's already the  4th edition and if
I remember right, it brought always some little 8bit releases.
Checking up  the file containing all the releases  I got  a bit disappointed, as
the old hyper  active 8bit scene seems to vanish slowly. All demo  stuff on this
disk  are 4 different  1k intros, a  few pictures  as well as  musix. But let me
check them up anyway...

ÒDrab by Fox

This little  intro has won the competition quite clearly and offers  a nice chip
tune, no  burner but better  as the ears tormenting noises of the other ones, as
well as some vector stuff. So you can see some glence vector cube turning around
on the  screen as well  as  some vector squares in different  colours. I have to
say I like this one and it has won the compo with right.

ÒWow1K by Raster of C.P.U.

This small  intro took the second  place and brings us a multicoloured scrolling
background thats layers are moving in different speed. You can listen to a quite
nerving tune  all the time you watch  the intro. As main effect after a while an
animated one plane sprinter comes up, running along the scrolling background.
That's it, looks not that bad for 1k even though the music is brain melting...

ÒFucking Weather by Bob!k of C.P.U.

This screen starts with a light blue background  showing some yellow circle that
obviously should  be seen as the sun. Some strange noises came up and slowly you
can see a  texture, thought to be  clouds, scrolling  over the screen. The whole
thing gets darker, darkening the sun and finally some kind of bolts are blinking
in the scrolling cloudy texture, together with some crushing chip noises.
Very strange idea, gets some bonus points for this :)

ÒLinea 256 by Lewis of AIDS

This one seems to be just a 256 byte intro, showing some of those 3d line effect
you learn  in Basic at the  first lessons in  different colours. Nothing more to
add here, looks a bit outdated and boring.

Other things from  the party? Raster of C.P.U. did an sixteen (?!) players  game
for the Multijoy interface called "Shot'em all". Ofcourse I wasn't able to check
it out here... eh, eh...

The pictures  are in  parts of good  quality, Raster  brings a  pic in 32o * 16o
resolution showing a fortress in the water or something. The others show comical
stuff or just simple logos, but mostly in interlace mode.

What we have left, the musix. I didn't matched it to get all of them to my ears,
I have to admit... But the  ones I listened are of good quality, for example the
tune  "Accident" by  Xray  of Slight & Taquart  or "Still Alive" by  Greg of Bit
Busters, that uses 8 channels in its tune.

I just  hope at the  moment, that there  will be a  next edition with more Atari
8bit related releases next year.
