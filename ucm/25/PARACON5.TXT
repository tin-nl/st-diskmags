Next to the bi-anual big atari party  there's always a more or less fixed amount
of smaller parties each year. Paracon is one of those smaller events and it just
reached it's fifth edition.
 Although the editions I attended seemed a success, last year's edition I didn't
visit because of the usual exams. That year there also was a limit on the amount
of visitors  which seemed  quite strange  to me. However, only  now I understand
why. But more about that later.
 The trip to  a party is a problem. Maybe it even is _the_ problem. Planning the
trip and  meeting up  with your  friends at  the right  time can  be a  bit of a
nightmare. Although  this year everything  went smoothly. I put my stuff into my
bagpack and  got on the  train. Just  over two hours later I arrived in Enschede
(+kut) and there Havoc picked me up with his infamous red Ford Escort.
 The  car trip to  Selters, the  traditional  location  of Paracon, was  just as
quick. We checked out  a bit of the  scenery at first, but soon it went dark. We
had just one pause for stretching the legs and continued onwards.
 Near  Selters we  had  to keep  our eyes  peeled  for  roadsigns but after some
minutes we  arrived safely  at the  partyplace. This was at 19:00, 2 hours after
the party had begun. So far, the  only visitor there was Charon of Escape. Quite
uncommon, with the Dutch guys often arriving last.
 We installed  our stuff  and spoke  a few  words  with  Paranoid and Charon and
waited  for the  rest of the  visitors  to appear. Meanwhile, there was a bit of
stressing  going on  in the demo  production department. There were bugs to fix,
there was syncing to improve, etc.
 Eventually  the first other visitors came in: the guys from Cruor (now ex-Cruor
;)) and the guys  from Escape and Checkpoint (including  Defjam this time). Even
Ray managed to  replace his  uniform  with some casual clothes for this event :)
There was  alot of  talking about  the  ACP with  Norman, who  even  brought his
coldfire  testboard  +  PCI video  card  for  working  at  the  party. Was  very
interesting to  see! Especially the  insane development tools he had constructed
for reverse  engineering linux x86 display drivers had me scratching the back of
my head =)
 Eventually another  familiar face  popped  up: Marakaman. He lived quite nearby
the partyplace  and decided  to drop  by with  his ct60 tower. I admit it looked
sexy. Even if  it didn't have that atari flair the colors of the machine matched
the atari  desktop pretty  well (grey + light blue). The ct60 seemed very stable
and I guess made a pretty fine Mint setup.
 Questions  remained  about the  usual visitors from previous years: Lotekstyle,
ST_suvivor and Zerkman. Sadly  none of them could make it this year. Hope to see
you guys at Paracon6!
 PIZZATIME! The  pizza wasn't  half bad I  might add. Although  Havoc complained
alot about the bottom being halfbaked. I told him to shut up and he went sitting
in his corner  of shame again. Although, with his size he could also have rolled
me into  a ball and  kicked  me out  the  window ;) Anyway, the pizza was okay I
thought, although the medium size didn't fully saturate me (This is beginning to
sound gay isn't it?).
 So the night  went on with  some coding (and  some pixelling  for Havoc) and at
some time  it seemed there  was so  many glitches  and bugs to be killed that it
would be  better  to  skip sleep  alltoghether. So that's  how  it went, coding,
pixelling, drinking  AfriCola, peeking  a  few  times  at  some  screens by Ray,
checking out Zweckform's democollection, etc.
 AfriCola, a  really much  better  than I expected  type  of drink, was consumed
eagerly  throughout the  party. The  local  AfriCola fountain  was guarded by Mr
Paranoid and  his evil  henchmen, who  were easily bribed for 1 EUR / litre. The
extra caffeine did give that kick to code through the night probably..
 The morning was  up and that's a  strange sensation when not getting any sleep.
However, there  was a delicious  breakfast  to anticipate. It  was  splendid, as
usual at  all the  edititions of  Paracon. Having consumed about five broodjes I
decided to call it a breakfast and went back to bugging.
 At that time Paranoid had  put up the beamer, which  sadly didn't  seem to like
many of the Falcon video formats. However, there  was a good  selection of newer
vga60 supporting demos to choose from.
 The bugging  went on and  at some moment  it was possible  to show  a (somewhat
ugly) preview of  the new lineout demo. It was ofcourse a bit crappy, but enough
about that.
 The party went  on and  there was  a small  informal  competition  of Gyrus and
Desert Falcon II on the Paranoia  commodore 128. Quite cool to play these games.
Gyrus I hadn't played in like 18 years perhaps. "memories..."
*needle scratching on record*
 Some of the guys went outside to visit a local spring which I completely missed
out on. And  there was  also a big fucking building of Jehova freakazoids around
as well. I did  see that  one, and  it looked  huge. Quite  strange  for a small
looking town like  Selters. What would be the odds? Yeah, what would be the odds
of an atari scene still existing in 2003?! Get on it with it will ya?
ñ= entering slag mode ===========================================================
 Apparently  there was  some radio program  made  by somekind  of an old haig to
'interview' (read: slag down) the  members of Paranoia  and this radio interview
was presented on the stereo of the partyplace. Although it seemed like a laugh I
think these reporters have poor taste.
 There is  an oldschool  8bit/16bit revival  happening (emulators, atari-shirts,
sid sounds in  the charts, isometric sprite 3d in musicvideos) so the media have
to write a  little about this. Unluckily  they decide to target longtime fans of
the cult machines and call them so 'uncool' and 'ungay' whatever.
 They talk about blocky  graphics, completely  oblivious to gameplay or sport or
creativity  and  without  the  slightest  notion  that  people  can  also  enjoy
themselves without  slagging other people off. These reporters have the insights
of a 13 year  old (and a  stupid one  at that) and  present  their opinion as an
expert view on trends.
 The piece  on the  radio was  indeed a laugh at sometimes, but I would urge the
reporter  to do something  more useful  with  her time. Respect  to Paranoid for
actually playing this at the party :)
ñ= exiting slag mode ============================================================
 There was some  pizza again that night and I liked it, so I did not wipe my ass
with it and  it wasn't  hard enough  to use as  a frisbee so that was out of the
question as well.
 That night we  decided it was time  for a nap. After a huge period of 6 hours I
woke up again  and descended  from the stairs back to the main party hall. There
was the 1040STe of Zweckform again  to play some  games and demos on again and I
decided to put it to good use.
 By the way, this party was the first time I ever spoke to Zweckform and Ralf in
real life. Really  friendly chaps  as well they were! Defjam seemed to be dozing
off again. Sadly he hadn't brought that comfy 1040STf to put his head on.
Too bad ;)
 Later on again it was time for that breakfast again (yeah!) and now there was a
little Paranoia  birthday cake for the 5th anniversary. I ate 4 broodjes, an egg
and a bowl of cornflakes mixed with that honey-corn cerial.
*Burp* That was that.
 After some  more craptalk  it was time  to pack up again, say goodbye and drive
home. The ride  home was  even more  easy  than the  ride to  Selters and at the
pluskut trainstation I say goodbye to Havoc.
 Let me spare  you the trainstuff  for this time and just conclude that it was a
good party. I'd say it was about the best of the three Paracon's I've been to.
Paranoia continually  decided to keep to party as small and cosy as possible. No
other party  has such things  as a breakfast this good and it's possible to talk
to all people in just under two days as well. A winning concept.
 It seemed that  Paranoid didn't have  any plans  for a 5th edition this year at
first. That's just strange when seeing the outcome of this great party!
Thanx a million to the organisers for making this possible :)
