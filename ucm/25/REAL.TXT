                         - ---------------------- -
          collected by POPPMANN of the megamighty FISCHBRŽT CORP.
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello again you little suckers and lamers outthere.. it's time to show up again,
what the mighty Atari sceners  did in the last months, and who else as the great
POPPMANN should be able to liften up all those secrets?

ñ...CUNT GIRLS...

Yes, they are back  and brought us  an intro for  the cool CHICKNECK magazine by
the HYPNOTIC BYTES, it  is called "Anal Intruders" and  seems to  present  their
sexual orientation once more...

ñ...DAMN HOT SWEDES...

Hum, it's quite silent  in the north at the moment, don't you think they prepare
something new for us? Anyway, their latest online competition was a full success
as the XMAS WANKING COMPETITION got high attention by the little Atarians.
Winner was DUMBJAM, who else, who has shot his load 3,25 meters (what a pressure
man!), closely followed by some britts and the skandinavian crowd (who else? who
is living  in a bunker the  whole year, needs  some special moment to get rid of
its load, don't  you think?). The last  one was the TOTE from Germany (he surely
took the right nickname as his dong was hanging like dead...).

ñ...DREAM...

As we  hadn't guessed  that, FAIRY renamed  himself into  FAIRY ULTRA lately, he
told us he just  wanted to show that something inside of DREAM is moving, and if
we  don't see  any code, but they wanted  to be in  the news, this was  the only
possibility. How right you are!
Meanwhile MAO was active for the YMCA ROCKERS again, inventing music in tubes...
But read more there...

ñ...EPI-DRAINAGE...

As this bunch of skandinavisk vikingare has no new ideas they just remixed their
2oo2 production "ATARI BELT" and under titled it just "PISS MIX", whoa.

ñ...HYPNOTIC BYTES...

GROW has released another issue of his congenious porn disk magazine CHICKNECK..

ñ...KLEINLAUT...

The new team by EEEKS is preparing a party in  the very next time and it is just
called OUTDATED as it is a party for Atari machines only. We have been told that
there may be  a load of stuff shown there... Releases? As usual party demos need
a long time untill we get the final version done, so don't wait for something...

ñ...MISTAKE...

DR. NO of this group seems to be quite silent on Atari  nowadays, working mainly
on his "DOPE" project, at least one who is serious about the things he does...
SHARON, their  underscored second  coder, is  very silent  as well, we have been
told, he  is hiding somewhere  as he's  in fear for  some palestinian terrorists
that may burn away his Faclon...

ñ...PARANOIA...

Isn't it  PARADOX that PARANOID joined  PARADOX while he still stays in PARANOIA
and he isn't changing his nick? Sounds quite cool: PARANOID of PARADOX^PARANOIA.

ñ...REGULAR DROPS...

It's quite silent  about the UK fighters since the last party, only DEMO (what a
nick!) showed  up with  his first Fo3o DEMO: "Are you feeling uncomfortable"? To
be  sure about the  question in  the title  he presents  us a stomach tormenting
tour de force through the ugliest DEMO effects ever done... Be sure to have some
bucket nearby...
Meanwhile the works on "JOINTLAND ADVENTURES" continued, at least we hope so, as
well  as it surely is a  problem of STINK's heavy  dope consume  that we have to
wait that long for it... or at least for the shit that will be provided with the
game...

ñ...THE NAKED BARCODES...

While FLUSH  disappeared  somewhere, rumours told us he is working for the Atari
Links atm, XXL then supported  MARSDOGS (.tSCc.) "UNDERWEAR MAGAZINE" with loads
of used  slips by himself, and not  to forget, with a little music as well, that
is just called "Down with your pants!"...

ñ...THE SHITTY CODE CRUNCHERS...

Hee! Their coder GAY went back  from the army now (hope they made a real man out
of him there) and so there might be  the hope to see their  last years demo with
the ugly name "DREAMS" somewhen on our machines. The other members of this bunch
of hyped lamers  didn't matched it to present us  fresh stuff since GAY left the
crowd to part room and bed with other men... so new blood is flowing through the
scene veins now.
MARSDOG is  preparing another issue of "UNDERWEAR MAGAZINE" that will come along
with second hand slips and  tampons this time. We have been told, the CUNT GIRLS
provided the last ones...

ñ...YMCA ROCKERS...

Lately they  came back, MAO, KLO-TEK-STYKLE, FPU-MC and 5,o5 and  their fellows,
with another ear cream, "HORRORS"... This  thing is provided in little tubes and
the cream in there has to be pressed as deep as possible  into your ears, you'll
life the  pure horror then  if you try  to get the  dried stuff out of your ears
then...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, that was  all so far, and you  little nobodies know some more about our kewl
scene now. As you  wont get this  stuff from other sources, you just have to sit
down and pray  to me now, send some  money or chicks and I may will come back...
Depends on the stuff that floods my mailbox...

                                                      untill next time, POPPMANN
