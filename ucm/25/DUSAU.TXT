                       DU SAU - A Falcon game by Foundation Two
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foundation2,  especially  Mad Butcher - greetz  to  him, see  you  at  the  next
jagfest - are known mostly for their atari 8-bit support, although they released
some nice Falcon stuff, like "Dryegg" or... "DuSau" - a new game 4 the Falcon.

Imagine  small, cute  pokeymonsters, like  little  pacmans and dragons, combined
with a  very colourfull  playfield... no, you  are  not watching  your  children
playing with their Gamecube, you are sitting in front of your Atari Falcon!
The game, DuSau, is a  kind of  cardgame, mixed  with Minesweeper and two player
combat games. You can  play it alone, or with  up to four friends, which is much
more fun!

Every  of the - yes, you  counted right - 5 pokeymonsters  has  its  own colour,
which is important for the gameplay as described below.
The game begins  for each  player in another corner or even in the middle of the
playfield. There  are cards  layed down, which  are the playfield, you  can move
step by step, card by card, 4 ways, up, down, left and right.
When you press  your firebutton, you  can look up the card, you are standing on.
It shows either  a coloured  arrow, or  a so-called death-card. Your  goal is to
find the death-card belonging to another player and so... kill him.
The coloured  arrows show  you the direction in  which you  have to go, when you
want to  find the  death-card  for the player, who  has the  arrows colour. This
sounds  and is pretty  easy, but you have  one other hurdle to take: Each player
who moves over a specific card, colours this card in his colour, e.g. red.
This card  cannot be  turned and  looked up, until  another player moves over it
twice, the  first time another player  will walk on it, he won't be able to look
it up and  the red player, who  fears that his death-card could lay there, gains
time, to make this card save again.

ÒConclusion: DuSau is a very  addictive game, if you have some competitors around
Ò            you, it is a real  party game and will provide yo many hours of fun.
Ò            Also the  single-player mode is  good for  a play between work, as a
Ò            game doesn't take t oo much time. The graphics  are  nice and really
Ò            cute, although they are much below of that what a Falcon can do, but
Ò            for a game like this, it's enough, because the gfx are not what this
Ò            game lives from! The sound and music are in acceptable good quality,
Ò            but not  my taste, as  I am not  a techno-guy, maybe  you can choose
Ò            between some music files in later versions ;-)
Ò            On the Jagfest 2K3 Mad Butcher told me, that they released this game
Ò            to show their  new game-developing tool and not just from that point
Ò            of view, it is worth a look, it  is a really  cool game, which tells
Ò            us again that our platform isn't death!
Ò            So my  conclusion  is, that  this game  should  be  in  every Falcon
Ò            player's collection!
