                            LAST PARTY 2oo3 Releases
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With pleasent regularity (ui?) this party takes place  at the last days of every
year. In former  times it brought  also some Falcon  releases to our screens but
the  latest editions of  those parties  feed only  the 8bit machines then as the
former fast growing 16/32bit Atari scene  turned to  dust again, while  the 8bit
scene survived.

In comparison with other last years  events this party brought a little flood of
demo releases for the little Atari and here we go to take a sneak look at them..

Ú"Pizza Opalenitzza Story" by Sikor & Miker

It starts with  a black screen  and a loading status, a chip tune starts to play
while the  some text is  displayed, finally  a P.O.S. logo  scrolls  in, changes
colours and  showing some "pizza"... to be  honest, I have seldom seen such ugly
"grafix".
The "show" goes on  with some kind of portrait slideshow that obviously has also
a story, but as always in polish language. The music  in this part seems to be a
kind of Eminem conversion.
After the  credits screen in  the same style  and a small picture showing a chip
with the info "all 4 64 KB" we already reached the end...
ÒWhat to say  more, just a fake or better crap demo, the best on it are the musix
Òeven though they are light years away from known quality 8bit musix.

Ú"Too Hard 666" by Atari Terror Team

This is another fake or better joke demo as they are wide spread of the nowadays
Atari 8bit scene. It starts  with a loading menu, where you can choose a version
of the demo to  start, maybe they're thought for  different RAM extensions, as I
didn't found out something special about them.
The demo features several parts, the  intro scene is showing the TwinTowers with
an airplane featuring  an Atari logo, together with the groupname, this is a bit
tasteless  for me. We go on with  some numbers fast displayed on the screen that
ends up with the  demo title logo. The whole scenery is brighten up with a quite
ok chip music.
At next we get some digitized animations, at first some "dancing" girl, followed
by some  polish text  and then  3 people "dancing" around, one  of  them holds a
bottle or something, surely Wodka if you ask me!
Then the music breaks and we see the logo of the old Warner Bros comics together
with a sampled music track.
The demo goes on  with another chip tune (a quite nice one) and a wave of techno
oriented pixels, the  screen is flickering  to the beat and we  get some strange
pictures and  animations, just like  a head looking  out of a toilet and a  very
primitive pixeled guy who gets an arse fuck with a dildo... Oh man, get mature!
The demo ends up with the credits shown on the screen...
ÒWhat to  say, one of  the usual fake demos, showing  just nothing  besides  dumb
Òpixels and text in  polish language... just forget it... only interesting things
Òare the chip musix.

Ú"Total Zalamka 2" by Sikor & Miker

Again Sikor and Miker are stepping into the ring, can it be good then? This show
starts with a  two colour hires picture with the title of the demo, and the very
low quality makes you ready for the things to come.
Along a fast and not even that bad soundchip tune the screen gets filled up with
pixel garbage then, followed by some kind of raindrop effect made with small dot
circles and some noises. Then the music goes back and we see another small hires
picture but I don't understand its sense.
After some kind of "greetings" screen the demo ends up... Just wasted time...

Ú"Delmes" by Miker & Sikor

This intro shows us some digitized photos together with a small chip soundtrack,
no effects except some kind of transition between the two different pictures...

Ú"Delvas" by Miker & Sikor

Hu? This looks quite  the same to the previous one, just using other colours, so
the screen is  blue/violett this  time and it uses another photo then as well as
another music. Quite dumb idea...

Ú"Grtz" by Sikor

Happily this  isn't a remix of  the previous two intros, but just a short screen
that prints the greetings of the  coder onto the  screen together with some fake
starfield and a nice  short music. But... I think  we have seen  better stuff on
the 8bit machines...

Ú"Rolo 3" by Animkomials

Another fake band, can  it be good then? It  starts with an options screen where
you can chose the output device, monitor, bigscreen or cyclotrone (?!). Ofcourse
the last option doesn't works and switches to bigscreen, that is the same as the
monitor  in the end, just with  the exception  that the scrollers  are presented
with a bigger font.
The intro starts  with showing two logos, the title above, and the group name on
the lower  border, both  are changing  their  colours. Between  them one jumping
scroller  comes  up, later a second  appears too, both  bringing  some  stuff in
polish language, you guessed it?
The ears are tormented with a damn strange  music all the time... if you finally
press space, some  more polish text  comes up in silence with big letters on the
screen. That's it... I wonder if there is something real to come in this compo?!

Ú"Vasmes" by Miker & Sikor

Arf... you surely  guess what this  intro brings, it's  a remix  of "Delmes" and
"Delvas" using the second photo's of each other intro to mix them up now, with a
new but ugly music... Just forget it...

Ú"Animkomials Interlace Text" by Animkomials

Arf... This "intro" just shows  an interlaced text... but what  were you waiting
for after that title?!

Ú"Matrix" by MacGuyver of Blowjobb

This small  intro starts with "Matrix" printed  in white letters on black screen
and then green lines of ascii signs are scrolling vertical over the screen, more
and more of them... it's the  256 byte conversion of the "Matrix" movie intro...
Quite nice idea!

Ú"River Raid" by MacGuyver of Blowjobb

He, funny thing, right yet. You can see some kind of airplane sprite flying over
a green "landscape" (if you can  call it that way) with  a river, together  with
some noises from the chip.

Ú"Xmas256" by Fsckers (?)

This  screen brings colourful  scrolling rasters together with some strange xmas
greetings to the screen. Nothing more to add, doesn't impresses that much but is
the most colourful 256byter...

A small wave of  pictures and  musix were released  on the party  as well but as
they weren't  presented as excutable file I wasn't in the mood to check them out
in the  end as  the fake  demo overdose  I had to  survive today killed all  the
motivation to do so...

ÒShort conclusion? Overall seen the demo  releases on  this party were completely
Òruled by fake stuff of the lowest  level. The few more interesting releases came
Òonly from the 256 byte level, but the rest was just... crap...
