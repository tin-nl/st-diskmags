Howdy, my scene friends! So here I am... hitting the UCM columns to complain to
a bigger audience! =) Steady Chosneck readers surely know what topic I am going
to touch... don't ya?  Well,  just  take a look at our garden... nice, picture,
isn't  it?  beautiful  flowers...  but  hey,  it's so silent in there, don't ya
think? where are the buzzin' bees...?  I touch the flowers... they are plastic!
I see a gardener  with a drooped head and sad eyes... his shoulders are scarred
after  heavy  lashes... He  was  blamed  for  it  not  raining  and the sun not
shining... There  was no-one willing to help him but there was a lot of passive
observers  ready to kick  his  ass  for  EVERYTHING. So why the hell did he not
leave this garden? Because  he  LOVES  his  job,  this  garden  and  all things
connected to it.

This  garden  is the *DISKMAGS* who are the *MIRROR* of the scene. It's hard to
imagine  a  better  place  than  that!  It's *OUR*  garden  for *US*. Internet?
Forget it... it's  so  cold,  so  usual,  so...  soulless! Reading the "on-line
based"  magazine  surely isn't that exciting and can't bring such a big dose of
joy IMHO... And I know  that many of you share the same vision. Am I right? Ok,
but... so wot...?

Take a look  at  our garden once again then... a lonely gardener and everyone's
shouting around from  the  house  windows... no-one's willing to move their ass
and  HELP  him... that's a heavily demotivating picture. Guys, STOP POKING YOUR
NOSES AND FARTING INTO YOUR SEATS!  Don't become the busy observers, please! We
really have TOO MANY OF THEM already!  Is it really THAT hard to write at least
*ONE* single article and send it over to Moondog or ST Survivor?  C'mon! Give a
hand and break da silence!

Phew... I felt blood burning in my veins... =)

I hope that none  felt  offended  reading  the  words above... but I don't find
a better way to express the feelings  living inside of me, sorry. We have a lot
of "talking pumpkins" around "without the stones"... Some  of  us keep spitting
on Moondog or STS for a bad  review  of  any release... But did anyone think if
THIS release really deserves respect?  Should they give high ratings to satisfy
anyone's vanity? Soapin' up everyone's eyes? "All's fine, all's cool!". Besides
writing your own reviews ISN'T prohibited. If You don't agree with their views-
write  your own and send it over to Moondog for example! He's an adult dude and
he won't HIDE IT anywhere, I am pretty sure...

            ÒSo think about it! There is nothing more needed to say!

       ÒMy deepeST respect for EVERYONE supporting any existing diskmags!


                                            ÒYou are worth our hard work!
