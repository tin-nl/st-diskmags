                            Interview with Paranoid
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UCM - Hi Paranoid. after the last Paracon party it seems to be  time to clear up
      some  things, so it would be nice if you could  answer a few  questions if
      you're allowed to speak about them ;)

ÚPara  I have to ask my attourney about that ...


UCM - At first, what do you think about the latest edition of your Paracon party
      series? Are you satisfied  with it? And if you liked it, is there a chance
      to see even more Paracon parties in the future?

ÚPara  We, the organisers, all  liked it and it seems that our guests liked it as
Ú      well. Organisation  of such a "small" party naturally  involves a lot less
Ú      time  than  such  a "big" party  as  the EIL or  the  Sillyventure, so the
Ú      ParaCon, as it currently is, seems to be good fun for all people involved.
Ú      It's a good  occasion for all the Paranoia-members to meet and also for us
Ú      to meet a few  good friends. Too bad the video-beamer was very picky about
Ú      the video  signals  so that  we could  play  only  a very  small amount of
Ú      Falcon-demos.

Ú      From our current point of few, it's pretty likely to plan another ParaCon-
Ú      party, but let's talk about that again autumn next year.


UCM - Ok, you brought us rumours about a new team on the Atari scene, words like
      Paranoia, Cruor and stuff were wandering through  the bulletins and in the
      end Paradox (right?) popped  up. So  what is  it all  about  with this new
      team?

ÚPara  You basically  summed it  all up already. The  guys from  Cruor were a bit
Ú      unhappy with their name  and planned to re-form the group under a new name
Ú      while I was a bit unhappy that my crew-mates were not really interested in
Ú      making demos  anymore but  rather in  organizing  events while I wanted to
Ú      keep making demos.
Ú      So, since Ronald, Ralf and I got along pretty well on and after the EIL #3
Ú      in Dresden as well - why not include me in their new team?


UCM - Can you tell us something about the memberstate of this new team?

ÚPara  Currently, we  have  3 members: Ralf Zenker, Ronald Wendt  and  myself. It
Ú      looks  like  Daniel Boerger, TNT,  will  most  probably  join  us, too, to
Ú      support us with additional graphics.


UCM - And, are  there some projects  in the pipeline  and overall, what machines
      will you feed with them?

ÚPara  Hmmm ... Can't really  talk about any specific projects yet simply because
Ú      there aren't any  at this  time. What I can tell  is that the machine that
Ú      thrills all of us currently is the STE, followed directly by the Falcon.
Ú      Pure ST-stuff is  not directly planned but when we see that an STE-project
Ú      is possible on the  ST with very  little additional work, we'll surely try
Ú      to make it ST-compatible as well.
Ú      Falcon-compatibility  is planned  for all  STE-productions. I can't really
Ú      imagine that anyone cares about TT-compatibility very much ...


UCM - What brought you to this way, to form a new team, at a time were the group
      -Paranoia- got its own place in the  Atari scene with  the growing quality
      of its releases.

ÚPara  Thanks for the flowers. But the later releases featured less and less work
Ú      from  my  crewmates  and I constantly  had to  cover  up  for  that. Their
Ú      interest  had shifted f rom making  demos, graphics or music to organizing
Ú      events and  since making  demos was and  is supposed to be fun, I couldn't
Ú      force any of them to contribute.
Ú      I think even a famous diskmag-editor said that once ...
Ú      So in the  end, I had  to face  the fact  that I will  either end up doing
Ú      basically everything  myself or simply  search for new companions that are
Ú      interested in making demos.
Ú      This is  also where I  have to correct  an aspect of your question: It was
Ú      the guys from Cruor who decided to reform their team and I asked whether I
Ú      could join them. So it certainly wasn't me forming a new team.


UCM - And what about Paranoia then? At first  there were rumours  about some STE
      activities, will Paranoia go on or will you dissolve it for the new team?

ÚPara  Paranoia will  continue  to exist with  me included, but  as a demo-group,
Ú      Paranoia  should  be  considered  dead. Hopefully,  we  will  continue  to
Ú      organize events  and probably  do some  other stuff, but the focus of this
Ú      group is certainly  not demos  anymore - therefore, no  real connection to
Ú      the Atari- or  demo-scene  in  general  will persist  besides the ParaCon-
Ú      party. The STE  activities only  exist in form  of some  effects and test-
Ú      routines, which  are all on  my hard-disk  and will  certainly  be used in
Ú      upcoming projects, just not bear the "Paranoia"-label anymore.

UCM - And, what  do you  think about  the current  situation in the Atari scene,
      after  the EIL the breath  of silence  is flowing  through  this scene, is
      Paradox your contribution to blow new air into the current situation?

ÚPara  I thought blowing  new air into the scene is UCM's duty? Or was it blowing
Ú      old(-school) air into the scene?
Ú      No seriously, give  us some  time to  get a few  things straight first. We
Ú      haven't yet  decided on definite projects yet and you will agree that this
Ú      is a must before releasing anything.
Ú      About the current  situation of the scene in general - I think we're still
Ú      going  downhill, but  at  least  we  stopped  picking  up speed. The scene
Ú      consists of  very competent programmers, graphicians and musicians and the
Ú      scene-events usually yield a good amount of high-quality productions ...
Ú      But the scene is  also very small, so that the amount of releases is small
Ú      and yet  again, there's  a big  problem  throughout the whole scene with a
Ú      phenomenon named "feedback" ...


UCM - Oki, that's it for  now, thanks  for clearing up some things and much luck
      for your future  projects and  way. if  you have  some  words left for our
      readers, just leave them here...

ÚPara  If I spend all my words here, I won't have any left for the Alive-readers,
Ú      so probably just this: Being a part of the Atari-scene rocks, so just stay
Ú      the way you are, folks. :-)

UCM - Many thanks, stay cool - stay Atari.
