                     1o years Falcon Demoscene 1993 - 2oo3
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1o years  already?! Oh gosh, how  fast the time passed by, sometimes it seems to
me as it was  just a few  years ago  that we  were sitting at the Dresden Coding
Convention, back in 1993, as I saw the first Falcon demo of my life, "Warum", on
the big screen, as well as the  days I was at Lot's home and I searched for more
demostuff on his Falcon's HD... A new  era was  dawning at  this time, the Atari
scene changed in a way it didn't made in its existence since the ST was born and
the ST demo scene arised in somewhat around 1987...

Seen from today those old demos have lost their most impressive moments they had
on our Falconless minds in 1993. But we have to face the fact that without those
beginners, a big  part of our  todays scene  wouldn't exist. And  in fact, those
first Falcon demo makers had hard  to fight  to squeeze  something out  of their
machines, problems you stumble  over in nearly every  of the early demos. Nobody
had a good painting tool for the Falcon and the fewest had  connections to PC or
Amiga Graficians, so the first Falcon  demos often featured just grafix, painted
on the ST and often it was a fact that just  one or two members of a group had a
Falcon at  all. Even though  the most  programmers  started quite  fast with the
development of painting tools and so on, it took  quite a while  until the first
reasonable results could be seen in the demos.

And so it was on all  edges, on nearly every territory the Falcon demo scene had
to start from scratch and for this point, the demos looked very amazing, even if
it took quite a while too untill the Falcon coders matched it to leave the Atari
oldschool  problem, you  remember all those  black backgrounds  and screens that
following each other without stylish transitions...

Ok, I wont talk too much blabla here  but want to write down my views on some of
the old demos, also seen from  today. I try to write those small reviews in best
possible chronological order... So here we go...

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       "Cebit '93" by The Respectables
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released ... March 1993

In fact, I wonder why I count  that demo here :) In fact it was just a laugh, as
it looked  somehow like a single ST screen and showed off  that The Respectables
were the most overrated chaps around on the german scene. Ok, just joking here..
The demo brings some nice grafix, a starfield (woah) in 32 greyscales, scrolling
and such stuff... so not much to say about, except that it featured a nice sound
track on limited 25 KHz (usually on STE)...

I have  to admit that  this demo belongs  to the most  seldom loaded demos of my
past... even today I have to say, it was just boring and I wonder where the hype
around Duke and Tyrem was coming from...

                             "Fever Week" by Aura
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released ... April 1993

This small dentro was the first Aura demo on the Falcon and at first not planned
to be a public  release. Aura  was already some  years around but got their real
breakthrough on the  ST quite late in 1992 with the demos "Mathematica" and over
all "Hifidreams". Esp.  Chris of Aura  did a lot  of documentations  for  Falcon
coding but  after all more or less only BDC was the one, who coded demos on that
machine.

So what  shows  this  little  thingie? We  get a multidirectional  softscrolling
background, showing a  faked TCB logo  and loads of  german text to read. Mainly
craptalk stuff. Between the  in and outscrolling textpages we get several vector
objects of quite big dimensions while a nice module is played in the background.

Seen from  today this  small demo  gathers  just very  low attention, it doesn't
shows off the real abilities on Falcon, in fact  there is nothing to see the STE
for example wasn't able to  show as well. Therefore it was one of the very first
demos on  the Falcon at all. At this  moment I'm not sure if it wasn't maybe the
first Falcon demo at all.

                               "Warum" by Lazer
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

release ... August 1993

Without any  doubt Lazers' "Warum" demo  belongs to the real Falcon classics. It
was along  with Sanitys' "Terminal Fuckup" one  of the  few Falcon demos in 1993
that used the  higher colour  palettes of  the Falcon for  some quite colourfull
effects.
Furthermore this  demo installed a  little hype around the band Lazer that never
matched  it to step out  of the shadow of the  big ST groups  before. It was the
first of three demos in a row that matched it to deplace other competition demos
and got the first place. This one has won the 68oXo convention.

The demo features  an original and for  those times very stunning soundtrack and
while  it  lacked more  or less  pixeled  grafix  completely, it  impressed  the
watchers with  fx like RGB vector  balls, a blurred/delayed  filled vector ball,
filled vectors  with hicolour  plasmas on  their surfaces, transforming big line
vector objects, multicoloured dots  splines, multidelayed flat vector logos, RGB
interference circles and several other stuff.

I still remember me sitting at Lots' home watching this demo over and over again
in autumn 1993, we just can't get enough of it... even though the demo was a bit
de-conjured  a few months  later, as Lucky of ST did  a demo with his old group,
The Friendship Cooperation, called "Spaceballs", that brought some of  the shown
effects to the ST.

Seen from today watching "Warum" is like digging out "Ooh Crickey" on the ST, it
is just a classic  on the Falcon, even though the effects don't knock your chair
away anymore, but "Warum" is a demo every Falcon user should  have seen and over
all should have  in his collection, as this demo founded somehow the competition
between the young  Falcon scene  groups even though Lazer was never  deplaced as
band in a competition.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  "When Dreams Become Reality" by New Trend
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

release ... August 1993

New Trend was  also a band that never matched  its breakthrough  on the ST scene
even if  they were since  quite a while  around. In fact  the band profited much
from the joining of Lig Lury, formerly known  as Mr.Pee of The Cyclemasters, who
was more or less responsible for the short rise of New Trend in  the Falcon demo
scene.

This demo was also released at  the 68oXo convention  but had no  chance against
Lazers' demo. While Lazer avoided it  to build in too  much pixelstuff to make a
break to ST demos, New Trend presenting  a lot of  grafix, all in 16 colours and
done on the ST. And except two effects this demo looked like a ST demo then.
Ok, we get a  quite hard rocking  soundtrack, but the  presented effects  didn't
matched it to come close to Lazers' demo.

We get a realtime  raytracing ball, 4 plane keftales together with shadebobs (in
those years a standard ST effect), a very slow  multicoloured texture cube, then
magnetic linevectors  and a starfield. So  nothing much revolutionary, just  the
texture cube shows a glimpse  of the abilities  of the Falcon as it  uses the hi
colour mode.

Seen from today I have to admit that this demo just wanders around in my archive
but I didn't  loaded it since years anymore, just for  this article again, as it
lost the few bits of its impressions after shortest time.

                   "Plastic Dreams" by New Power Generation
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

release ... August 1993

Another ST group comes up, NPG was well known in the scene since they released a
bunch of nice  demo compact disx, as  well as a megademo (known as the demo with
the thousand  names) and  some very cool  dentros (maybe  you remember "World Of
Wonders" that was also released in 1993).

They stopped  their works on ST as  the Falcon came up and belonged to the first
Falcon demo  groups and to  the best bands the german Falcon scene had to  offer
at this time, even though they never matched it to win a competition.

This demo is the first of the -only- two big demo releases they did on the Falcy
at all, somehow they started a huge game project at the same year, I saw the 1st
previews already  in autumn 1993, "Incubator", and this not only sucked  off all
energy the  group had  to offer, no, it  was also the last lifesign of  the band
itself... Some demostuff they were working on in 1996 never saw the light of day
in the end...

This demo  starts with  a raytraced  NPG logo, followed  by a pixeled title logo
that offers some  kind of main  menu (not interactive). All future actions start
from here then. The music is some heavy technoing tune we know from Tyan already
and stomps around quite monotone...
The show itself offers one after another many effects we know from the ST, such
as filled vector cubes, a dots tunnel with 4ooo dots, some complex vector stuff,
the demo furthermore takes the mouth very full as it announced to bring a better
rotozoomer than "Terminal Fuckup" by  Sanity and  this one  features a raytraced
picture. We go on with plasma stuff, a dots volcano and fractales...

Seen from  today this  demo is already overtopped by several todays ST releases.
The  steady use  of ST artwork by Carnera, that  isn't bad at all, improves that
feeling a lot. So the  demo belongs to the more mediocre  releases and I have to
admit that I didn't watched it very often, even in the past.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             "Crime" by DNT Crew
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

release ... September 1993

Also the DNT Crew  was known from  the ST but apart  from the unregular released
DNT Paper  diskmags they weren't  that much known  for demostuff. Therefore they
belonged to  the first french  bands that released  stuff on the Falcon and with
"Crime" they released one of the first multipart demos on this machine.

"Crime" comes along with a short looped heavy metal sample (that  goes onto your
nerves very  fast if you  don't like  such music) and several effects known from
the ST but  blown up a little bit now, so you get 8plane shadebobs, several fast
dots objects, a big lightsourced dnt vector logo, several mandelbrot screens and
two gelee balls as well as an end scroller.

The effects can't  deny their origin and the style of the demo seems to be quite
inspired by older ST demos, the usual black backgrounds and no liquid design and
after all, in 1993 the ST demo scene  made some big  technical steps that leaved
this demo far behind.

Seen  from today "Crime" belongs to  the demos you  wont load  that often again,
"Warum" was  long time not  topped (in fact 1994 better demos were released) and
this demo doesn't made  an exception. It  doesn't offers  any special effects in
the end and misses the special feeling "Warum" was able to create.

ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 WHAT ELSE?
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apart from those major releases a lot of other demos popped up in 1993 but those
were mostly just one screen demos. To the first  releases we can  count SANITY's
genious "Terminal Fuckup" that was some kind of crossconversion of an Amiga demo
and I  liked  it  very  much. More  stuff  to mention? LIGHT's "68oxo" demo  for
example and with autumn 1993 the slow dripping flow of  Falcon demos turned more
and more into a little flood, we saw the first screens by BLACK SCORPION, EKO or
even MJJ PROD with their "Place To Be" dentro that  appeared in reworked form as
"Mostly Harmless" one year later again.

Ok, after  those small  reviews let me  take some view  onto the new born Falcon
demo scene at  last. Very interesting  to know is the fact that  the Falcon demo
scene somehow has it's roots in the german speaking region again, as it was with
the  start of the ST demo scene, where  german bands  took over the same role in
the very first beginning.

And so the  majority of the  first releases  were done  by german  freaks and we
could  see bands  like  Aura, NPG, Light, The Respectables  or  New Trend moving
forwards. The  reason is  still quite  strange for  me but it could be that  the
quite  big german  Atari community  was the jumping  point at  this. In fact the
german ST scene  had left its  golden years  behind and a  wave of underdogs and
newcomers flooded the scene, while old bands still had a big reputation and over
all had their noses quite high in the sky.

Names like  ACF or Delta Force  still ruled  the scene  even if  their best days
already  passed by  but all newbies were measured  on their level and so the new
machine opened  some new territories  where all had to start from scratch and in
fact nobody was able to take a break on his old laurels. In fact none of the old
"scene gods" matched it to jump really onto the Falcon train... even though some
guys, just like The Respectables took their mouth damn full, as they announced a
new label called TWID, that consisted of Delta Force, The Exceptions and others,
really it was a laugh, as nobody showed up again...

Therefore the bands on the second range took  over the  show and  many underdogs
did the same  and nobody was  speaking of  the old ST heroes  anymore, the rules
have changed and  left the oldies behind. Though, unfortunately  only the fewest
of the new rising teams were able to keep the fire burning over longer time, the
most of them vanished after  2 or 3 productions... The fewest bands stood longer
than 2 or 3 years  active, this was a  quite strange thing as the newcomers, the
waybuilders already have left this  new scene before it was really grown up. But
they left footsteps for the followers... footsteps we still use today...

So peeps, 1o years  after, the Falcon scene  is still  alive, conquered very new
territories and it is a fact that it turned into motor of a whole community.
Some times back I really thought we have seen all, as the Falcon scene was layin
in stagnation, and  I was kind of  bored with  the new releases, but  the last 5
years showed us that the  machine still rocks, or better, the  coders still know
how to torture  it very well, to release demos and effects nobody has thought it
would be possible to do with the Falcy...

ñSo what? Let's go for another 1o years then!
