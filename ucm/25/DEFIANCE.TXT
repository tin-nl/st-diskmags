                         ASSEMBLAGE 23 - "Defiance"
ó--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So what about this electronic/ebm thingie? ASSEMBLAGE 23 creating right that, in
some parts quite oldschoolish ebm music as well as electro-pop stuff that tastes
just yummy to anyone who likes the more melodic things on this range, compare it
just with a little Depeche Mode, some spicey Front stuff, some VNV Nation and to
make it even more  tasty take some And One even too, smash it all into a big pot
and mix it up  once or twice, and you get a small clue of the things, ASSEMBLAGE
23 are  bringing to  our ears. And if  you think, damn plagiators, you're  quite
wrong... it's  very tasty  and shouldn't  be missed in  the CD box of anyone who
likes this kind of music!

Checking the tracklist...

o1 - Opened
o2 - Drive
o3 - Blindhammer
o4 - Cocoon
o5 - Document
o6 - Fallen Down
o7 - Horizon
o8 - Light
o9 - Maps Of Reality
1o - Lullaby

Short and pregnant titles, no?

I don't want to run down the whole tracklist now, just want to mention some very
tasty  songs. Such as track  one, a very good  opener as the  title suggests. It
stomps straight forwards without being stupid but quite melodic.
Also "Blindhammer" has a special drive, but leaves a slightly depressive feeling
inside, as many other songs later then too.
"Document" then is  another quite fast one, pure electro pop in its best way and
finally  with "Horizon" they  bring us a very  balladesque one, very calm with a
lot of piano passages and some Depeche-a-like parts, at least it reminds me here
and there to the heroes of my youth. Yummy!
"Light" then brings some oldschoolish drumplaying in the intro, reminds a bit to
the good  old eighties here and  there, before the track starts to move straight
forwards.
And... at last "Lullaby" sounds like some of Depeche's 8oies  ballads, just like
"It doesn't matters" and so on, this one crawls under your skin quite deep...
For me one of the best electro/synth ballads I have heard over the last years...

If this doesn't helps you to jump into the next CD shop to buy it, then at least
check it out, you wont be disturbed!
