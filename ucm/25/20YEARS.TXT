                      Any idea what we may do in 2o years?!
Û--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hehe, this idea came up in my mind after all those ideas about the future of the
world, Germany, multimedia, jobs  and stuff... And  so I will take a  sneak look
with a blinking eye into the future of the Atari scene now and what we may do in
2o years then... I know, 2o years  is a damn long time, but if you look back and
see that some people around  are already 1o, 15 or even longer active on the ST,
those 2o years aren't that utopic, don't you think?

ÒAlive

CiH is  creating this  magazine now  bound on  his bed  in an  old peoples  home
somewhere in the  UK. Unfortunately the speed in releases slowed down once more,
one issue every  two years isn't  that much seen from  today, but CiH has always
problems with the nurses there, as they switch of the power at 8 PM every day or
torment him with katheters and klistiers.
So CiH has to write  his stuff on paper again, as he did on Symposium 96... damn
hard job to bring it on the computer then if you're bound to the bed and are not
allowed  to stand up. But thanx God  Felice popped up  again, stealing the paper
issues from there to type them in at home...

ÒCheckpoint

Defjam finally matched it to convert "Hhmm..." to the ST, after he presented the
classical Falcon  demo "Sonoluminszenz" in 4k  on Error In Line # 9, as  well on
the old 68ooo machine. Therefore  mOdmate still announces the death of the Atari
scene within the very next time.

ÒCream

Ultra is still  preparing his long awaited demo called "Heftig"... thought to be
released 25 years ago he is now writing the endscroller as he told us lately but
since Morbus Parkinson  catched him, it is a torture for him to press the single
keys on his keyboard, now, but he announced  its releases within the next two or
even 3 years... in the end...

ÒDead Hackers Society

As many CTo6o Falcons died over  the last years, Evl decided  to rename the band
into  Dead CTo6o Society and himself  into CTo6oSurvivor. Their latest demo  was
just  called "Don't break the CTo6o" that  runs on  standard  machines again, as
with about  a handfull of running o6o's around, the demo wouldn't have that much
people who could take a look at it...

ÒEphidrena

Nerve decided to release another remix of "Atari Behn"... now called "Monochrome
mix" as he fixed  it to run  on  SM124 too, after  he released  the "ST mix" two
years ago, that  was running on ST, and  not to forget  the "8bits mix", done in
2o19, for Atari XL.

ÒError In Line Party # 13

The competitions held at this party were quite hard to put into any category, as
we got  demos for Atari Coldfire, Falcon Coldfire, Falcon CTo6o and even for the
mythical Falcon PPC. Ofcourse  the coders came into trouble as they got kicks in
their ass for not supporting the Standard machines anymore.

ÒMJJ Prod

They have released MJJ Slideshow 45 to entertain the scene once more, it is full
filled with grafix by  hyperactive C-REM  who is going to  release the second CD
that is  stuffed with grafix  for everyone. You  can even order logos and grafix
for your  productions by  PayPal on  the MJJ site, a 16 colours 32o*2oo logo for
your band will just cost small 4,99 Euros!

ÒSector One

They  did it again, they  released "Old Stuff" together  with the chaps of Dune,
their demo  from Error In Line # 9... ST Ghost  had to do  hard debugging  works
again, as always.

Ò.tSCc.

While Ray finally  works on  the finishing  touches of "Beams", moondog prepares
issue 27 of UCM.
LotekStyle is now known as HitekStyle as he got bored by chipmusic and oldschool
electro lately. He is  working on another CD colly, called "Blinking flashlight"
where he collected screenshots of flashy demoscreens in DIVX.

Hum... so what do we do in 2o years? Bifi Bifi, Bifi Bifi... errr...
