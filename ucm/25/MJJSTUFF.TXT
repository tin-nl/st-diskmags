
Ok pals, here I will  take a sneak  look at the  latest MJJ PROD releases, as it
was just little stuff that mustn't get a seperate article each.

MJJ Prod are working hard to belong to the  most active  Atarians in 2oo3 and so
they released  another little demo that turned out to be some kind of party joke
demo. Unfortunately  we have to learn that the classical Party demos are relicts
of the good ol' times...

After their latest releases featured the works by KIKSOFT and STRIDER, now their
coder TOOSEB is taken into the ring as well. So let us see what he can offer us.

The  intro  starts with  a nice but  old  chip  music, a  well done  MJJ logo by
Wilfried and  some short infos  about the demo itself that are scrolling upwards
on the screen. Those infos featuring a quite ironic touch and so they announce a
release without C-REM grafix, if this will be a good choice?!

The intro breaks while the digitized head of some beardy guy is displayed on the
screen and we're entering the mainpart, featuring now also music by TOOSEB. This
one is a quite unspectacular chip sound. It comes along with a kind of slideshow
featuring black/white pictures, in parts  drawn and  digitized, as  well as some
2 frame  animation of a "dancing" guy. This goes  on for a  while, showing again
and again the same pictures, that are of, to be honest, ugliest quality.

The whole thing ends up with another  digitized picture, showing  one of the MJJ
members laying on the  bed just wearing  shorts that  don't cover all of his man
attributes... Euh... Happily the demo jumps then back to the desktop...

ÒHmmm... what to say? MJJ did it  again! What? Releasing  another slideshow thing
Òas we can't call it a real  demo. It's a  bit disappointing  to see them wasting
Òtheir skills again for another fake demo thing  as all their releases  showing a
Òlittle glimpse that they can do more if they really wanted to do so...

Arf... you know what comes next? Another slideshow review... :)

This time the MJJ men decided to include  a little story  into it. The slideshow
starts  with another  neat MJJ logo  by Wilfried and  a sid tune by MC Laser aka
Lotek. There isn't  much of  an intro  sequence, the title  picture  seems to be
painted like a child then and so I wont judge about the quality ;)

The story is all about a Strider loving  Felx and an Amiga loving Strider, comes
along with  digitized pictures of quite good quality for 16 colours and features
a strange sense  of humour. It  furthermore represents the  impression we got in
IRC and on several parties, the french boys seem to be affected by  men as well,
and so do the MJJ men... except Strider who loves the connectors of his Amiga...

ÒSo what? Another slideshow, no burner again, leeching, watching deleting...
ÒStill waiting for the first real demo of the MJJers...

What, what? Another  small demo? And  what do I have  to read in  the intro? MJJ
together with Star Academy? Are casting shows now invading the Atari scene?!
Yes, somehow...

This small demo was  done especially for the little daughter of Fel'X that seems
to be a big fan of  a french singer  and newcomer Jenifer, obviously a so called
casted  new "Star"... I wont say more about this topic here as it is just wasted
time. So check the demo itself...

It is  nothing more  than a ... slideshow... arf! They did  it again... It gives
together with sampled passages of  a song by her and quite good converted photos
a small  portrait of  Jenifer, starting  with MJJ and  Star Academy logos in the
intro  and ending like that. I think  I must not  mention that the whole text is
written in french again...

ÒSo what? I think its  just for collectors and lovers of Jenifer, even though she
Òwill surely very fast forgotten again, as this small demo too...
