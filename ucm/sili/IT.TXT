This  is the  second  Falcon-demo and  you have  surely seen  their  first one,
called FIRESTARTER. Since this time their skilles are very improved and so this
new demo  brings you  some  very cool  effects, of  course without  beating the
winner-demo by AVENA...
Ok, this  demo was the biggest in  the competition and so I was very anxious to
see it, after  the other ones  have packed such  brainblasting stuff into their
smaller files.
At first I had thought that my copy of the  demo doesn't run because at first I
saw only some grafix garbage on the screen besides the music plays.
After  the demo-logo (a  rendered one, but  nothing  special) appears  my fears
were undfounded.
The first effect was a  bumpmapper on a  pixeled dragon, but this one looks not
very good and remembers very hard to their first one in FIRESTARTER. After this
a gouraud-shaded torrus  comes up (a bit  slow) followed by a  very strange and
abstract phong-shading-object. Also this object  wasn't very fast, but it's the
biggest phong-object so far on the Falcon.
At next  a textured collumn (or  something like  that) comes  up. It looks very
strange (eventually because of the colors) and features a kind of shading.
This effect was  followed by  two different texture-tunnels and a picture which
was  scrolling behind  a humped glass-plane (don't  know how to say). This  one
looks very strange...
Now the best  effect comes  up, 3D-bumpmapping! It looks really great. You have
something  like a big  struktured object  turning around on the screen with the
bumpmapping on it... horrible! The best effect in this demo.
At last a "vote us" picture comes up, followed by a greetings-scroller in hires
and finally  the demo  switches in 70 Hz (hum, also the  other demo from Poland
had made this dull thing... it remembers a bit to some french ST-demos...).
What should  I say? It's a  nice demo, no  question, but  it don't  reaches the
quality of the AVENA-thing. The effects  aren't brainblasting enough and I have
missed a continous design. Eventually we will see it in the next demo?
This demo  is quite recommendable, not  only for  collectors. It beats the most
other  releases of  the last year (I think  1996 was the  shittest year  in the
Falcon-demo-history) and you should really take a look at it...
