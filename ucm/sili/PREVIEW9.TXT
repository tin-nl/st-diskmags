                           PREVIEW TO UNDERCOVER IX
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum. I know, we have some months up to the release of this issue. We've planned
the release at the end of June or so.

What will you read that time? Hum, I don't know either =)

Because of the SILIconvention I don't expect many releases after the party.
With some  luck we can eventually review the releases of the NAS Party and also
the stuff which have several groups worked on but not finished for the SILICON.

We will try to make more scene-reports, perhaps about the scandinavian scene.

You can read also more interviews  and I hope that  we can include  finally the
interview with the guys of  TUMULT, because  I havn't got back this in time for
release it in the actual issue.

The coding-corner will perhaps  reopened. I hope to get some top-effecs and the
description of this things for you.

You will  read the biggest  music-corner in  the history of UNDERCOVER! We will
review tons of new stuff from the electronic scene, be sure!

Sorry, but I can't not  promise more  things. Perhaps we  can review  some more
games (like the commercial version of Running and other stuff...).

So at this point I'm also very anxious to see the next issue =)

Ok, keep cool!
