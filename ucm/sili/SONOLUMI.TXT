This was the  winner-demo, but I haven't the  final version for testing because
the guys  will improve the design of the  demo much  more, and so I have "only"
the competition-release... but... hum... I will not wait to  say that we have a
new world-beater  here! Yes, this  demo isn't  only one of  the best demos ever
made  for the  Falcon, no its surely  the best! As I  have seen this  thing the
first time I must scratching my head because  I couldn't believe that this is a
Falcon-demo, it looks like newer Amiga-demos and I think this should say all...
But I will not write more bullshit and review this brainblasting demo for you.

Ok, the demo starts with some squealing noises of Tommi's  module and the first
thing  you will  see is a water-surface  made with  phong-shading (?)! It looks
really great. You  fly some seconds above the waves and than you will dive into
this sea. Now there  are some phong-shaded and textured fishes  swimming around
and they're moving very real and they leaving  little bubbles... The background
looks as the sun  is shining on  the surface, I can't describe this with words,
it's just  cool. After a  very big dolphin you can see fishes which  were a bit
other styled, this time it's a mix made out of shading and delay, it looks very
strange... don't know...
After a  little Avena-logo  the title-logo  scrolls  over  the screen  and some
abstract  one-plane-grafix appearing  on the  screen, followed  by another very
great idea. You  will see a  textured and  shaded wasp on the screen and also a
abstract  tree and  meanwhile the wasp is crashing  against the screen the tree
is turning  and stretching around on the  screen. Between this two  objects the
letters of the demo-title blinking off. Hum.
Than a very  cool picture  of A.-t- appears  on the  screen (I think it was his
compo-release).
The demo goes  on with phong-morphing  and finally it looks as you're inside of
a phong-shaded box... it's strange and I can't describe this effecs again...
After this you can see  several  phong-shaded  objects, so  there are stars and
heads and  other stuff, followed  by a new texture-tunnel. This time it isn't a
round one...
Another world-beater is coming up with a very big textured and shaded head! Oh,
I really can't believe it to see such stuff on my good old Falcon!
The  demo ends  with some  phong-vectors (the  Avena-letters) and  another very
nice picture of A.-t-...
Hum, finally  also some  words to the  great soundtrack of Tommi, who has again
written a  great piece of  music which  matches to  the whole demo. It's a very
atmospheric sound-track and not only "bum-bum"...
After this show I was  sitting on my chair, still very impressed and also a bit
more satisfied because this demo shows what the Falcon can do if there are some
very skilled coders on this machine...
I must say  that I don't  know if all the different shading-stuff was phong, it
looks  sometimes very  strange and you  should watch  this demo  by yourself to
understand what I have written here.
I can only say that we have a very high  standard now on the Falcon and you can
forgett all  the big demos of the last years. This demo don't  suffer from very
outdated  effecs like  the most productions in the  last time and the following
demos will be compared with this new production and  I don't think that we will
see such a high-level-production in the next time, even if  it's sad, but there
aren't many coders with this skills left on the Falcon...
Hum, I'm  writing bullshit  again. Just get this  thing and be prepared for the
biggest impression of your Atari-demo-history!
