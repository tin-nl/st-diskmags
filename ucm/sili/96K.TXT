Hum, there  weren't  many intros around and  the Atari-stuff must get in direct
comparison with the stuff of other systems... and what should  I say, you don't
believe me if I say to  you that  a little  ST-screen has  made the run, before
Amiga and  Falcon-stuff! I  for myself don't  know why OUR demo =) has made the
first  place. I  think it was  only a  flash of nostalgic feeling for the  most
people to see a little ST-demo again and so they have voted for it...

Because m.O.d. has said that he wouldn't test our demo for Undercover I will it
review  by myself. I  will leave all ratings. Ok, at first a little story about
this demo-screen, because it has a very long history.
The first parts  of this screen  were dated in the middle of 1995. Mike of Stax
had asked us if we would do a screen for the new STAX-megademo he had worked on
since months. We were  very proud and  started to work on a screen. At first he
was  named "Waste" and  then "State Of Mind". Sometimes in  autumn we  lost any
motivation  to finish this  screen, as we had heard that the demo was laying on
ice. This time the whole intro-sequence up to the lemon-dots was ready.
So the screen was forgotten and we digget it out in autumn last year. This time
.tnb. was very  motivated and we tried to release it as own little demo. And so
we worked some days (also on a little .tnb.-party at my home) on it and finally
it reaches  the part with the  tri-di-rasters. Because we haven't matched it to
release it on the INTERcon last year the demo was forgotten again and as Drizzt
had said that he will stop his activities I had never thought to see it again.
And so I was very  surprised to hear  that Drizzt and Flash have released it on
the SILICON... Ok, the  shown version isn't the  final one, we will improve the
design a little bit and include a real finish. But it's really possible that we
will see it  sometimes. Hum, it isn't the great demo which we have promised but
it is on the way. I think  it must be  released as fast  as possible before the
motivation  is lost again. Ok, what  you can expect? Hum, besides  some more or
less nice grafix from all the (ex-) .tnb.-artists there are effects like lemon-
dots, zooming  chessboard, several other  dots-stuff, 3d-rasters, burning line-
vectors and a delayed rotating-zoom. It features also a more or less good dsign
by our ex-chef-design-man m.O.d. (today he torments the guys of .tSCc. with his
strange design-ideas =) and I would say it's not only a mediocre ST-demo... Its
a good one, at  least in comparison with the most other ST-releases in the last
time... I think you should  get it, if you like ST-stuff, and don't  forgett it
will run also on the Falcon...

Whatever Moondog wrote. Most of the design was by me... =) drizzt

                            "SIX SIEVERT" by .tSCc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

competition : 3rd place in the Intro-competition
              official the first place * READ THE LAST MESSAGE *
system      : Falcon only (4 MB & RGB)
credits     : coding  : Dynacore of .tSCc.

m.O.d. has told me that the 96K-demo by .tSCc. will be a great  thing with cool
grafix  and  8-voices-module  and of  course cool  effects  and so I  was  very
anxious to see this thing.
Now I have it on my  harddisk and  sometimes I think that m.O.d. has a bit very
"dick aufgetragen" (don't know in english =)
The demo starts  with the little  sentence "the end of the world is nigh" and a
"design"-effect.
Then  a .tSCc.-logo  appears on  the screen  and a filled  and shaded vector is
turning  around  on  the screen, then the logo turns to  the low border  of the
screen, followed  by  a big "Six Sievert"-logo, which  is scrolling  with  some
waves before and after it over the screen.
After this a tree with many branches and  made of 3d-lines coming up. This tree
is burning down and the credits coming up.
The next  effect is  a gouraud-shaded  torrus  which  turns some  rounds on the
screen and dives in the background.
The last screen is the greetings-part with a little scroller and delayed vector
bars in the background.
The demo ends with the Six Sievert"-logo by m.O.d. in hires.
That's all. The demo  isn't bad, no way, but after the big words of m.O.d. I've
expected much more. Ok, the single effects, grafix and  also the music are good
and the whole screen features  a continuous design but obvious it wasn't enough
to impress the party-gang...

Aaaarg... This is  the first FUN-release I have seen up to now and it is in the
same primitive  style as the most  D.B.A.-Falcon-releases. Sorry. All  what you
can see in this demo is a pixeled FUN-logo and some zooming words (the names of
the FUN-members). This  is surely one of  the shittiest Falcon-intros ever made
and so I will not write more about it.
