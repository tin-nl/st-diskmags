Hum... After a Bible-demo last  year by the  religious fanatics  SPIRITS now we
have  another extreme  thing here. This  time it's a  satanic demo and it comes
from the "wastelands" of  Poland, erm... It could  be that this demo  should an
answer to  the SPIRITS-demo and  this would be really crazy... Before I give my
personal message to this demo I will review it for you.
The demo starts with several lines in hires and some words like "unholy digital
art" and  so one. The music starts to  play and it's a good one, ok, it's not a
brainblasting  soundtrack but  it matches to  the demo without being extreme or
so...
Then some  coloured logos  of Pandemonium  and the  demo-name appearing  on the
screen  and another, very cool, picture  by Eloy of  Complex comes  up with the
credits of the demo. Above this picture rolls a glass-ball, always seen before.
At next a skull comes up and zooms in the left upper corner and builds together
with pentagrams and turned cruzifixes a frame around some gouraud-shaded vex.
The following effect is also well known, it's the good old fire with the greets
but this time it's good timed (as the whole demo).
And after  to turned cruzifixes  scrolling to the left and right border you can
see some burning line-vectors on the screen (again a pentagram...).
After this the picture by Eloy comes again, but this time  in black & white and
some shaded glass-vectors are turning around on the screen.
After this an End-logo appears and the demo goes in 70Hz-mode... urg...
Ok, as you can see there were only old and outdated effects used in this demo.
The grafix are (except the picture by the Complex-man) only mediocre, the sound
is ok as I have said above, but also nothing special.
After this I would ask you about the sense of this  demo. I think all the demos
haven't a deeper  meaning and they shouldn't bring divers views of the world to
the demo-watchers. Now we have  a God-squad and a satanistic-demo, when we will
see the first political demos? Hopefully never. And I think you know my meaning
about religion. I  think Satanism  is at  least so  feebleminded  as the  whole
christianity-shit! But  I think it's  funny to see the  primitive structures of
some simple-minded individuum which believe in God or Satanas... You make me so
sick!
Ok, this  demo is something  for the  christians, because so  they can test the
newest excorcist-techniques on  this demo, they can sprinkle the disk with holy
water and can try exorcist the devil out of this demo...
This demo is also  something for all  those little cemetery-disgracers, so they
can try  to hold a black mess by watching this demo, they can sprinkle the disk
with blood and do other dull things with it...
