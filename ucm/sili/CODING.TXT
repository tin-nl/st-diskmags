                          CODING COMPETITION RESULTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The coding-competition on the SILICON was ruled by the ATARI-coders, there were
no other  entries... This time there were 4  different  screens and I  must say
that there quality is better as I had thought!

The first place was going to Llama of .tSCc. with a BUMPMAPPER for the ST (!!!)
and  this was a really  great thing! Ok, it wasn't the first bumpmapper in only
4K (yes, Seb of SPIRITS  had coded such a  thing a half year ago for the Falcon
but he had  not relesed this  cool  thing...) but  it's  for the ST and this is
icredible!

We of .tnb. have  made the  second place (very scarce =) and Drizzt had coded a
Wolfenstein-routine  with a burning  sky... It's for the Falcon and  you should
get it to build your own meaning...

The third thing was done by Sage of DESASTER AREA and brings moving fractals to
your screen... nice... but nothing special, at least this is my personal view.
It's a Falcon-screen.

The last screen was coded by the guy behind the game NEUROBOTIX. Earchaeopteryx
has  brought the  only screen  with music (!). At  first you  can see some cool
plasmas and  then a wobbling "Icerain"-logo  with little pixel-spreaders on the
borders... Also a very nice thing... 

Hum. After this I ask you  what we will see at next in only 4K... Phongshading,
motion blur  or what?! I really  can't wait  for the next  screens because they
show the powerful skills of the Atari-programmers...

UPSI... At last also a little review of the Fake-demo by CREAM.

There screen  was called "Solonuminaeszanz" and is a fake-version of the AVENA-
demo. So you must know the AVENA-demo to understand the jokes in this demo.
It will  run on a simple STF  and brings  you the AVENA-demo  in one-plane  and
ascii-stuff... Strange eh?! They  have even  done a chip-music  in style of the
original-sound-track by Tommy...
What should I say?! One  of the best  Fake-demos ever! And  much funnier as the
SENIOR DADS stuff... =)
