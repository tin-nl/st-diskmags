Wow! If I  should to be  honest, so I must say that  I had never thought to see
again  something from  this  promising game-project. Please remember, the first
preview is about one year old and not only a single  information about the work
was given out, at least I haven't received anything.
And so I  was very impressed  to get this hot and fresh and IMPROVED preview of
the game and so I will not withhold this thing from you.
The most of you can surely  remember to the first preview of this game. We were
all very impressed  of the nice grafics, the cool animations and the glas-clear
sound. Ok, there were no enemies or so in the game, but we were very anxious to
see it... Now, one year later, we can really talk about a "Rayman"-clone!
The whole game was extremely improved. The grafix are much more colourfull, the
hereo WILLIE has  more features (he can climb, duck and defend), there are some
enemies included and all were cool animated and have there own charakters (cool
things, some of  them are laughing  if you  will kill them and you miss...) and
also some traps and lifts.
This time there  aren't any panels (with score and life-energy) included and so
I will tell  you that your  hereo can  endure 5 contacts  with traps or enemies
before dying. So  you must be  very careful  because you have only one life and
will go back to the desktop after dying.
If you think  this is a  dull idea you're  right, but  this game makes you very
addicted to it and you will load it again and again.
Even if this preview features only a very little level (1280*960 pixels) you've
many things to do to  finish it. This  time you haven't a special job, you must
only find your way out. In the final game their will be much more improvements,
so there  will be more worlds (you're still in the jungle in this new preview),
some possibilities to become new skills for your hero and many more enemies.
This  sounds all  very promising and  I can't wait for  the final version and I
hope to have  some money if it's  finally released, because this game is surely
worth buying. You will don't need a Jaguar or PSX with "Rayman" if you have the
Willie-game!
So go on and get this preview! You'll be impressed as never before!
