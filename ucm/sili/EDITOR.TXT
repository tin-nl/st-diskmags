                      EDITORIAL - UNDERCOVER SILICON SPECIAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                      

           Heyho and welcome to the SILICON-Special-Issue of the UCM!

Yup, I  know, we  couldn't hold our promise to release  this issue on the party
itself but  because of  my absence  it wasn't  realisable. I hope you like this
little  special-issue anyway and I hope it's interesting enough, especially for
those people which couldn't come to this event.
Because of  my problems  to join  this party  this special  is a bit smaller as
planned. So you will not find any interviews in here. Another probleme were the
few releases. It isn't as much  as hoped  for. Ok, we  have more releases as in
the last year (4 big demos!) and  they're on  a very high  standard  but we had
hoped  for more  stuff because  there were  about 400 or 500 guys on this party
present and many guys of the ATARI-scene (all the great names) were there...
Drizzt had asked me if it would sensefull to release a special-issue because of
the very few releases but I think we have promised this and so we will do it...
As I have  said above the releases have a very high standard  and if I say that
we  have now  also big morphing phong-vectors  on the Falcon and bumpmapping on
the good old ST you will believe me!
If you want  to read more  just look in  the reviews-corner. We have also a big
party-report and again a crazy realtime-article. Hope you enjoy this stuff!
At last  we have  reviewed some  other stuff  which was released at this party,
even if there weren't many other things really released there.
I've tried to get also  some informations about the Mekka-party which has taken
place at the same  time about 100 km in the east of Bremen. This multi-machine-
party hadn't the same fun-level as the SILICON and there wasn't only one ATARI-
demo  released, but  I will  give in spite  of it some  informations about this
event... And finally you will find informations about the VOLCANIC PARTY 3 here
in this issue, which was held at the  end of February this year. And so we have
a real massive PARTY-Special for you...
So this  issue contains  about 150 KB  of articles  and I know  this isn't much
stuff  for you  but I  hope you  enjoy it anyway. We  have leaved out any other
things because we wouldn't blow up this special with tons of useless stuff. But
I have included a little  special area with reviews of stuff which was released
around the  party-days. So  you will find a fresh preview of the WILLIE-game in
here and this will be the best game for the Falcon, be sure!
The next "full-lenght" UNDERCOVER you can expect around the end of June and you
can believe me  if I say that  we  have many interesting things for you in this
issue =) just wait...
But now read at first this little special!
