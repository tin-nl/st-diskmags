With SILI CON CARNE we have the first and only german demo for the contribution
and with ESCAPE it isn't from a new-comer-one-man-band (what a word =). We have
see the first things  by him in autumn last year, as he has won the 4K-compo at
the INTERcon '96. After the code-work for  the MODULATION Musicdemo by the guys
of CHECKPOINT this his first  real big demo and it's also the strangest demo on
the SILIcon.
Ok, I will not start in the middle and review the demo from the beginning.
This demo  starts with some  noises of a  techno-module and several hires-logos
and words. The intro is a bit colourless BUT... after some dots-stuff  the demo
turns into a very colourfull one. At first you will see the picture of a sun or
so and this  one will be distorted in several directions, looks good. At next a
plasma zooms and distortes one the screen... hum... a bit outdated I think.
But for the  following effects  I haven't a right idea what  it should be. It's
something like colourcycling-stuff  and looks fantastic! The module by 505 gets
very groovy and spheric and so this demo is much  more impressive. Besides some
line-vectors and other dotsstuff there are again and again the strangest effecs
and I'm sorry that I couldn't name this stuff, it looks marvelous!
I can only say  that you should take a look at this demo  to get an idea of the
shown effects.
The demo itself is finished with a desktop-picture with the credits.
Hum. If you like colourfull and spheric  demos you should get this one! The sfx
are as stunning  as the effecs  are crazy. I think  we will see much more stuff
from this guy, no question!
But it would be better if  he could write an information-file for the next one,
to describe his effects =)
