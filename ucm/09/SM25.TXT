                              SOUND MACHINE v2.5

done by : The Beast of Typhoon / Supremacy Corp.
system  : ST / STE / Falcon, 512 KB RAM, RGB / VGA / monochrome

SOUND MACHINE is another chip-sound-player and converter. It runs (a little bit
buggy) also on the Falcon and can replay the most usual sound-chip-formats. Ok,
for replay  there are some better players around (with much  more formats) like
the FANTASY PLAYER or our (.tnb.) MEGAPLAYER (hehehe =) ...) but for use on the
Falcon these aren't the best.
But SOUND MACHINE cannot only replay  the sounds, you also can  identify files.
But this little feature isn't very good. So it doesn't know the Synergy-driver,
one of the most important drivers of the last time, at least in my eyes.
But therefore the program understands also several packers.
Ok, here comes a list of the sounds you can replay

Hum. There  is also a  convert-option included, but I haven't matched it to use
it right, because there isn't a read-me-file included.
A bit not-understandable  for me is that the Count Zero driver was used to play
Scavenger-sounds (not  all). Hum, an  own format  is also  included but I don't
know how to use it.
Some final words: it's a nice little player, even if this  thing is still a bit
buggy and not finished. There is a must to include some more formats...
Ok, we will see what future versions will bring...
