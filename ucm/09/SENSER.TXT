               INTERVIEW WITH: SENSER OF SUPREMACY & VECTRONIX
              -------------------------------------------------
                  (made with the multi-UCM-interview sheet)


Hi Senser of Supremacy & Vex! First  of all something  about  yourself. How old
are you and what do you do when you're not sitting in front of your computer?

* 20y
  when im not comput-ing, i play tennis. go out with friends. or seeing tv too.


When did  you first  come into contact with  computers, and what was your first
machine? What  sort of  computer do  you have at  home? What do you enjoy doing
with your computer apart from programming, music making or painting?

* started comput-ing in 1988 with a sony's MSX...
  i now own a Ste with 4mb, an A1200 with 6mb and a pentium with 16mb.
  (and still playing my msx games through my emulators :)
  i like playing too! and i like watching demos.

I'd like to know a little about your background in the scene... how did you get
into the demo  scene? What were the first demo screens you have taken part in?
What was your first group before you have joined your current crew?

* pfff too far(t)... cant remember them :)


Can you  tell me something about  your current  group? What is your function in
this band?

* im in 2 groups on atari : - Supremacy (ascii+pixel)
                            - Vectronix (ascii+ansi)


What about the projects of your group? Is there anything to come in the future?

* Supremacy - St collection #11 (summer 97?)
            - The Supremacy ST Cdrom (900 games, 500 demos) (around june'97)

* Vectronix - Supporting the scene... (always forever)


... and how  do you view  the large-scale  death of  the  Atari demo  scene? At
present  it seems  that everything's  going down  the tubes. Do you think there
will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?

* i think (thats  my  opinion) that  a resurrection  is  possible, through  the
  PaCifiST emulator... large quantity  of peoples  left the st scene for the pc
  scene... but with this fabulous emulator... we  can expect  those  coders re-
  starts coding  68000... (for  example, french coders Zappy, PoiPoi, Keops are
  actually  Pc  coders, and  now  they  want  to  restart  coding 68000 through
  PaCifiST!!) - PaCifiST can be THE solution!


Will you put your Falcon/ST in the corner one day and put a PC on your desk?

* already  done :) no, in fact my st  stands at the  right of  my pc, and  both
  are // linked... (the same for my amiga)


Right, before everything gets out of control here, here are a few subjects that
you can show your views on with a couple of words or a short paragraph.

What's the one thing you really can't stand?

* too many things, all will not fit on a 720k disk!


Good, I'd like to leave it there, and if you have a message for our readers, do

the best for your group and your future projects!
