                             THE UNDERCOVER TEAM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum, the UNDERCOVER MAGAZINE isn't a .tnb.-only production anymore. Without the
massive help of .tSCc. and support of several guys in the european scene we had
never reached the  current state. So I will introduce you the team which stands
this time  behinde the  magazine and  if they wouldn't help  us you would never
read the one or other article in this magazine and  without their  help  we had
surely stopped the mag...

DRIZZT of .tnb.        - the coder of the shell...

MOONDOG of .tnb.       - the main-editor...

MC LASER of .tSCc.     - The news-man... without his big  modem-activities  and
                         his good contacts to the european scene we hadn't such
                         an actual and big scene-area.

mOd of .tSCc.          - Our PR-man. He's active  in the Inet  and the IRC like
                         mad and if he wouldn't do this some guys in Europe had
                         never  heard of the UCM and because  of his activities
                         we had never got a new UCM-HQ...

GREY of SHADOWS        - Yup, he's our first HQ and he  brings us all the stuff
                         and news from the  scene in Eastern Europe. Because of
                         his  activities  we have  more time  to work  in other
                         directions...
                         
MARCER of ELiTE        - His board ELiTE's HIDEOUT is now also .tnb. HQ sweden.
                         Because of his great activities in  spreading the mag,
                         collecting votes and news he's also the swedish UCM HQ

Up to now the team isn't the biggest  one and so we're  still interested to get
more  people for  the  UCM-Team. So  we're  still interested  in guys of  other
countries which would build up a new UCM-HQ to collect articles, votes and news
stuff and  to spread the latest issues of UCM  around. So if you think you have
enough contacts to support us in the right way get in touch with us. We're very
interested  in HQ's in  France, Netherlands, Finland  and the  good old Maggie-
country UK... =) But all guys from other countries are also very welcome!
Just send us a letter and join the UCM posse!
