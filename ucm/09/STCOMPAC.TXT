                           NEW COMPACTS FOR THE ST/E
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if the compact-disk-scene is  nearly down we have matched  it to receive a
lot of new disx which were released around the  last few weeks and months. It's
sad to see this in former times very  big part of the scene  dying. I hope that
the last survivors will go  on as long as  there is the  possibility to collect
stuff for high-quality-disx, especially  the good old  demo-compils and we hope
that we can  review also in future  issues of the UCM this kind of software for
the ST/E... I formyself  prefer the good  old demo and intro-compils, but there
are nearly no guys left in this  sector. Sometimes I think that there is enough
stuff out there to pack at  least one or two disx per  month, but then there is
for many weeks  nothing you could pack to the disx... It's sad... If I could, I
would try to release such disx, but  I can't code and  so it isn't  possible to
open a new  series of demo/intro-only  compacts... And  so I must sit  back and
watch what's going on in this sector of the scene...

                    MODULE COMPILATION # 13 "Golgafricham"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

done by : .tSCc. / Germany
disx    : 1 DD
type    : module-compil
system  : STE & Falcon, 1 MB RAM, RGB & VGA
release : 15.06.1997
credits : intro code - Scy of .tSCc.
          intro gfx  - Dynacore of .tSCc.

Yep, after a very long time  here comes another  volume of the best MOD-compils
on the good old Atari STE. We must wait about a half year for this one and it's
again a nice disk.
The intro is  a little bit older and contains  a little shot'em'up game by Scy.
The grafix are good and you  can listen to a new (at least I haven't heard this
sound up to now) chip-music. Unfortunately the intro is a bit buggy on the F030
(only on VGA?). Don't know if the intro will run on a simple ST because my STFM
is out of order since a week or so.
Ok, the disk contains  besides the modules the wellknown SIRIUS player in v1.4.
The disk is filled up with only 4 mods:
"ASTRALEBENE"       by MC Laser of .tSCc.    (4 channel Protracker)
"BLOCKADENBRECHER"  by MC Laser of .tSCc.    (4 channel Protracker)
"DISCONIGHT"        by Scy of .tSCc.         (8 channel Octalyzer)
"QFT GOES TECHNO 5" by Lot of .tnb.          (8 channel Octalyzer)
All modules are again in techno/electro-style. This time there aren't brand new
compositions included (this compil  was in work for many months) and two tracks
were already released. So the  mod "Astralebene" was used in an  older issue of
the UCM and released for the INTERCON'96. The mod "Disconight" was used for the
invitation-demo for the SYMPOSIUM'96.
The oldest mod (and besides "Astralebene" my favorite) is the "QFT..."-modules.
It is one of the  few finished HQ-modules of  our now inactive musician Lot and
was done in 1994. It's relative uncommon for Lot, because  he don't like techno
and he  tried everytime  to  make the techno-scene  stupid (you  don't know his
other "QFT..."-releases... mad but  funny =) ...) and  with this  module he has
done a very melodious  and nice one. My other fave mod is the "Astralebene", it
is a wonderful ambient-tune and it sounds like an old record...
The other two mods are ok, the second is  very strange, but if you like the old
electro-pioneers KRAFTWERK you'll like it for sure.
Hum, all  in one it's again  a nice disk, even  if the intro  doesn't reach the
quality of the  last ones. The intro isn't the most important thing on a music-
disk, I think. Just get this disk if you own a STE or Falcon!

          intro msx  :

Ups. After a long time without any lifesign I had thought this last french demo
compact series was finally stopped. The last one was released over one year ago
and so I was very surprised to get a new volume, and this time on two disx.
The intro isn't state  of the art, sorry. It's just a scrolly/music/logo-thing,
but the menu is  ok. You can get some informations about the single screens and
so you  know something about before you're loading the stuff. The menu is fully
mouse-controlled and you will come back to this screen after the most demos and
intros.
The included intros  and demos are a  sort of ST/E/Falcon intros and demos. The
latest stuff  were some releases of the SILICON'97. Other  stuff which is worth
to be mentioned  is a trained (!?) version  of the last HMD demo called "HUMEUR
VITREE" and the "CRAPMAN"-game from the last SYNERGY-demo. There are many older
things included, like  several DCK-screens (...) and  older  demos like "SINFUL
SINUSES" by CHRONICLE. Other stuff are several  intro's by .tnb. and .tSCc. and
the great ST 4K from the SILICON by .tSCc. ...
All in one this two disx are filled with nice stuff. A minus-point is that some
of the stuff is four  or five years old  and really not worth to be packed on a
compact-disk, sorry. I think it would be better, if  they had packed the better
stuff to only one disk and sorted out the old crap.
The good point  is, that there is still a demo/intro  cd-series around and that
there are new volumes coming up in the next time...
If you're a compact-collector you should get it. If you already have the better
stuff you don't need the disx...

After over a half year here comes the second edition of their SID-compils. It's
the first  AM-compact  since 3  years with  an intro  and at  first I  was very
anxious to see this thing, because I know about the quality of their old stuff,
I think some of their old GSC-intros belong to the best ST-intro's ever made.
Hum, after I have started this thing I was very disappointed, only some rasters
and text and a module (also on the ST)... That's all... Ok, it's a little plus-
point  that  they have  done again  an intro, but  I had  expected  much better
quality...
On the  disk you will find again  a sort of C-64-SID-sounds, together  with the
CREAM-player for STE and Falcon.
Nothing more to say, only that  the following SID-CD's will be for Falcon only.
What  should I say? It's  only a disk for collectors  and guys which don't have
any contact with the Inet to leech the sounds...

                               TUMULT CD #11
          "SPACE FIGHTER" AND "BANG AND BLAST MAN - EXPLOSIVE FUN"

                           by TOKKEL of SuperZIP!


This compact disk starts up with an intro by "Dynacore of TSCC" which is really
lame in  comparison  to the  stuff TSCC  is doing  nowadays. It  shows a moving
background made out of a lot of triangles, some ugly big 1-plane  triangles and
a 1-plane  scrolline in  the lower part  of the screen. Looks really awful. The
thing that shocked me about  that CD is the  fact, Dynacore and  M.O.D. of TSCC
told me, that the guys  from TUMULT have stolen  Dynacore's  code. He  did this
screen some years  ago. Originally it  should have been  an intro for  a Module
Compilation. Those TUMULT-bastards never asked him for permission  and Dynacore
does not  even know where they got the code from. I think that the behaviour of 
the members of TUMULT is just awful  and lame. Why are  you not doing  your own
codes and cracks?

The disk contains  two games  that where  already cracked  and spread  by other
crews:

1.) SPACE FIGHTER by Frontier Software. There  was already a test  of this game
    in an other issue of UnderCover, so  there is no need to  tell you anything
    about that. The version on this disk also works on 1 MB STs.

2.) BANG ANDBLAST MAN - EXPLOSIVE FUN by MegaGold
    This game starts up with a lame "Loading"-Screen  showing a big  ugly drawn
    bomb and a lame "Loading"-logo. The game  starts with several  informations
    in a  scroller, telling you  everything about the  makers and  so on. After
    this, the main menu  appears. In here you can  select a lot of  things like
    screen  frequency, music (which is mainly Mad Max and Count Zero chipsound)
    and player options. The game itself is a "Dynablaster"-clone for the ST.
    The grafics are a bit colourless and monotone. The bonus items are the same
    as in other "Dynablaster"-versions. The control of the players via joystick
    is quite good. But after games like "Dynabusters+" we can await a bit more,
    also from a simple STF. I won't do a rating for  this game due  to the fact
    that I  would have  to play  it a  bit more  to judge  objectivly. My first
    impression is that you better register to Dynabusters+.
