                              SENIOR DADS ON ST!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoho! Yep, the  british coding-gods have release 2 of their brainblasting demos
on ST! This hot stuff is called "ST FLOORMAT" and "THE ANTI-TECKNO TECKNO DEMO"
and you surely suspect  what you will  see in these  two productions, filled up
with hypnotising effects, terrorising music and shameless texts.
Their first release was the "ST FLOORMAT" demo in March and believe me, some of
the ST-owners are lying in the corner because of  the brainblasting  effects or
have destroyed their machines, 'cause they can't believe that these evil coders
can produce such great demoscreens on this humble 12 years old machine.
And they really  don't need any DSP or customship to let your screen flash like
a stroboscope or to blow away your speakers! Great stuff! 
With their second ST-release they have matched it to show all the technomaniacs
the finger (you know which finger I mean =) ...). And if you think that the old
Grotesque-demo was a hell of a  demo you're so wrong! Just get this one and you
know what a real knightmare is!
I will not  write more shit here! Just  get their releases if you want to be up
to date!
