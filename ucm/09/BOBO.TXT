                          BOBO IN WHITE WOODEN HOUSES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ups, don't remember about the title of this album =(

album, released by Pilgrim Records / 1992

"Hey, what's going on?!" will you ask me... Had Moondog again changed his taste
of  music? No way... but  I like very different  styles and  so I've decided to
test also  other stuff as only  dark and  electronic music for you, to make the
corner a bit more colourfull.
At first I will start with this  nice piece of  light guitar-pop. Don't know if
you  have ever  heard of BOBO... Only  a little  story by the way... because of
this woman a  dull and  stupid young man  from switzerland must change his name
in DJ BOBO =)
Ok, this is an older album of BOBO. She  had released  some months  ago another
one but I haven't seen it up to now. So I've  taken this one  because I've been
told that this should her best one. You will find the following songs on it:

01. Ever The Wind
02. Wide Awake
03. Blues For Niki
04. Troublesome Desire
05. Aside Of The Road
06. What I Mean
07. Hole In Heaven
08. Beg Your Heart
09. Fooling Around
10. Crazy Tickle

And even  if this are massive  10 songs the  playtime of  the whole album isn't
much longer as a half hour...
As I've  said above  the style of this music is really light guitar-pop and all
the songs living from the glass-clear and elven-like voice of BOBO. It's one of
the most impressive woman-voices I have heard for long time.
The melodies of the single songs are sometimes a bit simple and going very fast
into your ear and brain.
My private favourites on this  album are  the songs 1, 2, 4 and 6, but also the
most others are really good.
The only  thing I  don't like is that  the playtime  is very short and you must
press the repeat button everytime.
What should I say? If you  like such  poppy  guitar-music  just go  to the next
record-store and buy it...

At last (as always) the songtexts...

Ever The Wind
-------------

As I went a walking way down by the green wood
down where the ivy and laurel entwine
I heard a bird singing his sad plaintive love song
he mourned for his true love as I mourned for mine.

I brought my love flowers and tied all with ribbons
soon the sweet flowers were faded and gone
like the flowers my true loves affection has withered
which leaves me alone here to pine and to mourn.

Ever the wind keep on changing their journey
ever the waves keep on changing the sea
ever green summer keep changing to autumn
my true love has changed there is no change in me.

My constant companions are sadness and sorrow
trouble has never forsakken me yet
but wherever I go til my days are all numbered
the love of my soul I will never forget.

Ever the wind keep on changing their journey
ever the waves keep on changing the sea
ever green summer keep changing to autumn
my true love has changed there is no change in me.

WIDE AWAKE
----------

To be wide awake
to be frank with me
don't be discouraged
you gonna be so free.

To be horrified
if it escalates
even the pious side
is desolated.

In the disarray
we are in a rush
it's pay one's way
and eat my dust.

To be wide awake
to be frank with me
don't be discouraged
you gonna be so free.

Why bother? You might ask
You know it couldn't last
to look for a reason isn't beside the point
to figure what went wrong.

So the pale faces
were discoloured
well in any case
a new world is disclosed.

It seems what we heard is just a tale
all the misbelievers failed.

Should the irritable mood fly away!
Let the gloomy meetings end
oh let's go on dancing
though the chaos is perfect.

Why bother? You might ask
You know it couldn't last
to look for a reason isn't beside the point
to figure what went wrong.

BLUES FOR NIKI
--------------

Wehre have you gone little sister
how we laughed you and me
I've been waiting for you
I realize it's in vain
you've run with the black haired boy
you don't care where.

Why are you gone little sister
how we laughed you and me
I miss your lightness
I've thrown away my energy
what did I do wrong
sometimes I stand behind your house
watchin' your window.

I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
together.

I know I have to face up the facts
we've got to stay alone
over and over again
we are always waiting for someone
who doesn't come anyway
and you don't know
what you mean to me.

I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
together.

That's why I sing a song
even you can't hear me
you've run away with that black haired boy
it's such a sad old feeling
you've run away with that black haired boy
you don't care where.

I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
I don't ask much
just to keep in touch
to waste our precious time
together.

TROUBLESOME DESIRE
------------------

'cause your way is stopped
'cause your way is wild
'cause your way is stopped
'cause your way is wild.

When you go away
it makes me feel so high
when you go away
it makes me feel so light.

And I remember the time
as a virgin my life was undisturbed
from troublesome desire
what you ever hurt.

When you go away
it makes me feel so high
when you go away
it makes me feel so light.

And I remember the time
as a virgin my life was undisturbed
from troublesome desire
what you ever hurt.

When you're rough though I do love
when I stand stunned your laughter
shows it undisguised
when you're rough though I do love
when I stand stunned your laughter
shows it undisguised
when you're rough though I do love.

My troublesome desire
my troublesome desire
my troublesome desire.

'cause your way is stopped
'cause your way is wild
'cause your way is stopped
'cause your way is wild.

ASIDE OF THE ROAD
-----------------

Outside it's cold
I'm walking down the road
which changed a lot since i passed it.

Here where now and then
a bright light shines
was it a little while ago dark and grey.

But as a woman is asking me
How are you? And said I'm doing good
I can watch the way she looks
'cause of all the bloody news
I know that I can't change a world
which makes me sometimes feel so blue
but she couldn't know what I know
that I got you.

I'm living on an island
aside of the road
there are so many things in face of
which I'm helpless.

I took you to the island
and you take me.

Before the first kiss falls
I notice your touchy mouth.

But as a woman is asking me
How are you? And said I'm doing good
I can watch the way she looks
'cause of all the bloody news
I know that I can't change a world
which makes me sometimes feel so blue
but she couldn't know what I know
that I got you
I got you.

WHAT I MEAN
-----------

Language is a fussy case
some time we quit
words got a fixed meaning
for some people
we are right in their midst.

Between people one is used to
reactions to certain signs
that is similar to animals
except a response inside.

But what I mean means
hearing as a complex faculty
hey darling what's the matter
I try to see.

We are like politics
in our duels we are talking
but all of a sudden
drawing revolvers in our walking
he who listens first to the words
'stead of taking care
of the hands and the eyes.

Will get worse
will get worse
will get worse
will get worse
Look at my hands!
I see your face
but I don't know now what you've
said
Look at my hands!
I see your face
but I don't know now what you've
said.

All the colours are so much stronger
sorry I don't understand
all the colours are so much stronger
sorry I don't understand.

But what I mean means
hearing as a complex faculty
hey darling what's the matter
I try to see
but what I mean means
hearing
hey darling what's the matter
I try to see and see
and see and see.

A HOLE IN HEAVEN
----------------

There's a hole in heaven
I come falling down
I seek you in a green-white grand
meadowland
but if you don't wanna embrace me
I send big bubbles to the air
I leave all my sorrows behind.

And I fly fly and cry
I fly fly and cry
I prefer to be free
and I shouldn't have to wait any
longer.

There's a wave in the ocean
I move on to you 
I dive to find you in a stormy white
whirl
but if you don't wanna catch me
I'll hop onto the next blue wheel
and I drive away in the wind.

And I fly fly and cry
I fly fly and cry
I prefer to be free
and I shouldn't have to wait any
longer.

There's a hole in heaven.

BEG YOUR HEART
--------------

I don't believe
I'll find the love
anywhere outside
I should find and awakin' the power
deep inside of me.

I should not wait for love
to catch me
somewhere outside
and on some far better day
passing by.

I don't believe
I'll find the love
anywhere outside
I should find and keep the power
deep inside of me.

For all that I hurt you
you're not angry
but your heart perceives it all
oh I beg your heart
let all the bitter things be falling down.

I beg your heart
please do believe it's true
I never meant any harm to you.

I beg your heart
please do believe it's true
I never meant any harm
to you
to you
to you.

FOOLING AROUND
--------------

We are 2 fishes
swimming in the sea together
we have circled around
nobody could catch us
in the shimmer sea
nobody could find us
so deep down.

We are 2 birds
we could fly together
we like to cross the sky
voices are guiding us
to the big city
where we lost each other - bye!

Fooling around
now when I can't find you
fooling around
it's one of those lazy days.

I'm just fooling around
old bicycle
you take me through the streets
look there! A young man is coming
he lends me the coin I need.

I check out, babe
is all the weakness in me?
you are not there
what a stroke of luck
these telephone answering machine.

Fooling around
now when I can't find you
fooling around
it's one of those lazy days.

Though we could really move
could really move
I just fool around.

Fooling around
fooling around.

CRAZY TICKLE
------------

Here is just a smile
it's all I'm gonna give to you
questions all you hold fast
the feeling is a lost old
and a gained new.

All the things are new
relationships are changing
we touch each other
take attention
we are speechless or tellin'
ordinary things.

I drink the wine and eat green
cookies
remember the crazy tickle
of the beginning
the same we felt without drugs.

In all that jungle we can find
so many things
some taste bitter, some taste sweet
we take care or feelin' careless
something is lost
something is gained.

Just a smile...
