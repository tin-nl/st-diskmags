                               - COBRA STRIKE -
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                               

...when I got this game some time ago, I was really looking forward what it may
look like. The  title of it  made me  curious, I  thought about  that nice game
called "Super Cobra" I played years ago on my atARi XE. But  the disappointment
about "Cobra Strike" just came after playing it one time...

"Cobra Strike" comes along as an  executable file that has a  size of 244 k. It
only works  on STF and STE. After loading, we  can see the title  screen of the
game. In the upper part of the screen a  white "Cobra Strike" logo in  capitals
is shown. This one doesn't look that nice because it is not  antialiased. Below
this, the  name of  the creator  of the  game  is  presented: Ross Mc Naughton,
coder, grafician  and  musician  for this  product. There  is also  a highscore
shown, but  unfortunately the  program does not  save to  the disk, so  it only
gives you the  highscore of the  day. Eventually there are some  small logos in
the lower corners of the  screen saying that the game  is a product of "Serious
Soft" (is it worth mentioning that an other name of the well-known Falcon demo-
group "ThERAPy" is "Seriouz Software"?? ;)  and that it was written in STOS.
The whole screen  is accompanied by a chip tune, playing a theme by J.M. Jarr‚.
It doesn't  use any of those "newer" stylish sound routines like AM Sidsound or
Insignia Trisound. It  seems that it was made with the MAD MAX editor and so it
sounds pretty old.

By pressing the fire button on your joystick, we reach  the playfield of "Cobra
Strike". For  all of our  readers  that are  at home  in games, I only  need to
mention "SWiV" as a comparable game. For all others...read this!
The playfield scrolls form the upper part to the lower part of the screen. Your
player is shown by a helicopter. You've got to kill all enemies that are coming
from above. (Well, that's what I call a short  description of  what principle a
game has ;)) As  playfield  we see  some big meadows, forrests and deserts that
are displayed in the worst colors I have  ever seen. It's  just _pure_ green or
_pure_ yellow. Nothing else. Scattered through this landscape, several bunkers,
cars, tanks  and  houses  lay  on  the  ground,  again  drawn  with  an  awfull
colorization in an even more awfull  style. Your enemies in the air  are mainly
jetfighters  of type "F 117A", but as  they are  shown in the game  you have to
think of  drunken pilots or  damaged steering systems - the jetplanes just move
in boring sinewaves  and this doesn't  look pretty  realistic. Well, so far, so
bad. The thing that brings "Cobra Strike" to  the "top" is the  control of your
own chopter. When I played the  game first, I nearly  broke my joystick  before
recognizing that the player  really _is_ so slow. The  sprite reacts  so slowly
that the game  is kind of  unplayable. After  some minutes  of flying  over the
landscape  I pressed  the  reset-button  on my ST, fully  persuated by the high 
playability of the game...

Overall: Don't say that we cannot expect better games coded in STOS! There must
have been  a possibility  to draw  better  graphics  than the ones shown in the
game. I also  cannot image that the  scrolling of the screen and displaying the
enemies takes  so many  frames, the coder was not able to fasten up the player-
sprite a bit. Therefor "Cobra Strike" is a real flop and not advisable playing,
yes, not  even worth  to be coded  six (!) years  after high quality games like 
GODS or WOD.
