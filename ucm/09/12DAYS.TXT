Demo:         12 Days of X-mas 
Group:        Sinbad of Effect
Review by:    MC Laser/.tSCc.


Well, I have  downloaded this demo  from their support BBS in  sweden and I was
very  excited, because  it comes on 2 disks! I put  the disk into the drive and
short after that a message appears '12 Days of X-mas by Sinbad of Effect'.
After a while a menu appears. This thing looks more like a diskmag than a demo.
The shell looks well known to me. Argh! It's ripped from the old POWER mag! Not
a good move! Let's go on...

First their is a little so called 'demo'. It plays some fucking X-mas music and
some X-mas gfx  are displayed. It's  an interpretation of some christmas-song I
can't  remember. Oh my god! Even Jesus  would have nailed himself to a cross if
he had seen such a shit!

Next their  is a slideshow. Guess what? Christmas-pics! Most  of them look ugly
to me. That's  because most of  them are converted from GIF-format or something
like that! Alright, some of them are nicely drawn... if you like X-mas stuff! I
don't!

The 3rd thing  is a little sample-demo with some... Aargh... X-mas songs! 'Last
Christmas' by WHAM for example! Oh shit! Could it get worse?
The rest  of the 'demo' is  filled with texts concerning X-mas! Infos, stories,
jokes and lyrics. But I ask you... WHO REALLY NEEDS AND WHO REALLY WANTS SUCH A
SHIT! 

After that I have  seen such a demo... I hate X-mas! With such a shit you never
get any acknowledgement  from the demoscene!!! You  can hate me now... but what
for... telling the truth?


C u l8r and happy X-mas! ...Oops!
