Yeh, please kick  me in the ass, Ed! Hum, sorry  that I review the demo of your
game so late...
I had received a first version  of the game in spring  this year but it doesn't
run on my Falcon and so I hadn't the motivation to start it on the ST... I know
that this is a fucking dull thing, but I was very stressed with the work on UCM
issue 8 and so also some other things were lost...
But now I will take a look  to this game and what  should I say? Also the first
impression was really good! It's  the first gfx-adventure for the ST since long
times. And it isn't only a  thing like SHEER AGONY, no it's in the style of the
wellknown Lukas Arts games, like MONKEY ISLAND or MANIAC MANSION. And to say it
a bit more precisely, the  grafix of DONKEY ISLAND remembering a bit to the PC-
game DAY OF THE TENTACLE... Very nice drawn comic-grafix and good animations...
In this  game you have  to run around with  the hero, called Fred, and find out
what happened to  the unreleased sequel  of another classic ST-game called "Dog
Island" - the sequel  is called "Donkey Island" (erm... you  surely  know which
game is  meaned...). All your have to do (...) is to get hold of a copy of this
game... In  this preview you can run around at your home and in some streets of
the city. There aren't many places to meet in this preview and there isn't only
one little sound-effect  included, and so I will  not give any  ratings because
they would damage the very good impression of the game for sure. The final game
will contain  also sampled  sound-effects and so  it could  be one of  the best
adventure-games on the ST since very long times!
I will also  leave a little message in here: even if  nearly the whole  british
demo-scene is gone  it seems that the  U.K. is still the home of the best game-
producers  for the ST  and  of course the  Falcon. While  in  nearly  all other
countries the work on game-projects are slowed down  to zero in the U.K. nearly
every month comes another hi-quality game for ST or Falcon, ok in the PD or SW,
but it doesn't matter...
Last words? Just watch out for this  game! It will cost only 5 pound and if you
really like adventures  it is the right thing for you, especially for this very
low price!
