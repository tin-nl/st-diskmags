                          NEW DISKMAGS FOR ST AND FALCON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep, here  we are again, with  a view on the  productions of our mates all over
Europe. But don't expect too much, we will not review any little piece of them.
We have sorted out the most interesting stuff...
Today we will start with our big brother in UK, the good old MAGGIE...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               MAGGIE - ISSUE 23
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

produced by : THE MAGGIE TEAM / RESERVOIR GODS
released    : May 1997
system      : different shells for ST and Falcon (ST shell runs also on Falcon)
object      : allround-mag with an EYE ON the SCENE (...)

Hum, after more  as 4 months the guys from England  striking  back with another
issue of the most read mag of the ATARI Scene. At first  we had heard that they
will  release it  at the end  of April but  nothing happened  and so we were of 
course very anxious to see it sometimes...
And here it  is. I've received  the ST-version  at first. This  time it doesn't
contain  an intro  again. It  seems as  the times  of ST-intros  for MAGGIE are
finally  over, it's  sad. The mag  itself contains the  new main-menu by TAT of
AVENA but  still the old DELTA FORCE viewer, but  there is a new one planned as
you can read  in the news-file of the mag. The menu  itself is nice looking but
the music is a bit too old and is going onto your nerves after only one minute,
hmmm... there are a lot of better sounds around...
This time there are about 80  articles included, a good number I think (even if
we have beaten them again =) ...). The mix  of the articles is very good and so
you have  the usual news-corner with infos from the scene, the games-market and
so on. There  are several  reviews of games  and demos included, like  the most
SILICON-releases, WILLIE and RUNNING and also some utilities.
There are some music-reviews included and the latest disk-mags reviewed. (Thanx
for your good review of the UCM.)
Another good part  in my eyes is the coding-corner and here you  can read again
something about the ST-demo-secrets (which shouldn't be secrets anymore).
At another point I must laugh... as you can read in the review of UCM 8 in this
magazine they don't  like the adult-corner  very much... but why the hell there
is a x-rated (a hardcore-story) article included  in MAGGIE 23? It's the hidden
article. So  I have a little  question: what  is the problem  with this kind of
articles? Do you  have something against  sexual fantasies? I really don't know
why. And  another point: I really don't think  that there is someone how hadn't
read the articles  in issue 8  of the  UCM... Ok, I will  try to  get some more
stories of this kind for the following issues of the UCM and I hope to get more
stylish ones, not only "fuck around the clock" stories... =)
Ok, back to MAGGIE 23... All in  one it's again a good issue, but there isn't a
real highlight included. The articles are interesting, no question, and they're
a bit more actual as the UCM in some reviews, but there is something missing...
Don't know what  and why... ups... another  point: the goodies, in former times
there was real good stuff included... this time it was a bit low...
Last but not least some words for the Falcon-version. It has the wellknown menu
(slooow...) with some colourfull grafix by SH3 and a funky tracker-music. There
is also a little  intro included, made  by polish  SHADOWS. Ok, it isn't a real
intro, only  an animation-rout, but they  don't have  finished it, because they
had to work for their next Falcon-demo... But all in one it looks promising.
Final note: Just get it! At the one point it continues the MAGGIE-series in the
wellknown good way and at  the other point  there aren't many mags around which
I can really recommend and MAGGIE brings not only good articles but also a good
shell and so it makes more fun to read it as some other publications...

                                 FUNSCAPE 1.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

produced by : FUN 
released    : May 1997
system      : Falcon only, 4 MB RAM, RGB & VGA, harddisk only
object      : mostly scene-oriented

Yo, finally  they have released it, the  follow-up of the  DBA-mags. And as the
guys behind the  mag are nearly  the same it  is needless  to say, that the mag
looks, sounds and tastes like the old DBA-magazines.
This issue  remembers to  the DBA MAG 14, which  was presented  with a Windows-
shell. This time you have a Netscape-look-a-like  shell... I must also say that
this shell  is still one  of the best on the Atari, no question. It's faster as
the one of Maggie (not as buggy as ours =) ...) and features tons of options...
But a mag lives from the contents and hum... what should I say... in this point
FUNSCAPE 1.5 is very disappointing. Not  only that they  have used our SILICON-
realtime-article  without  our permission (I don't  know  why, because  we have
already  released this  article in april  with our SILICON Issue... Don't know,
but it seems that this guys don't like their mag without a realtime-article. Ok
it is a kind of tradition for the ex-DBA-mags, but this time I don't understand
this...) no, the mag features all in one only 50 articles.
Only very few reviews (3 ... in  words >three< intro's of the SILIconvention'97
were reviewed, besided some games and  tools) and also  the other articles were
mostly all other as interesting, sorry. Ok, there are some scene-news included,
but they're from  the last year. The only really interesting thing (at least in
my eyes) was  the up to  now unreleased  realtime-article of the SYMPOSIUM last
year. The lack of the contents cannot compensate with the  good modules and the
good outfit. I've quitted the mag after only a half hour...
Don't know if they will continue the mag, but  please guys, bring us more text!
You could damage the image of your mag! If you say that the old DBA-mag is dead
you're right, but the FUN-mag  is the SAME  thing! The DBA-mag has written some
history on the ATARI and it  would be a  bad thing if  you would damage it with
more issues of this style. Please invest more time to write articles! The shell
is too good for only a handfull of mediocre articles!
Ups, I must mention that there is a lot of stuff packed  to the mag. All things
are FUN-releases, little intros and games. Check it out!
Final  note: A very  hard thing. Ok, a  wellknown mag is  re-incarnated, but it
suffers from the contents... Only  one or two issues  more of this kind  and no
one is interested in this mag anymore. Sorry, but this is my opinion...
