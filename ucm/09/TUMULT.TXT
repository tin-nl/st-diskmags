Hi together!

I've  some questions  here and it  would be nice if you can give for me and all
the readers of Undercover some answers...
Because I think real names aren't interesting ;-) I'll go over to the important
things...

- When was TUMULT founded and why?

CAPTAIN F.   "It was fount when I was worry that Metallinos has sent me two new
              games he did which were  on 2 disks  even they  easily could have
              fit on 1 disk... I crunshed  them just for  myself and  called it
              Tumult... My neighbour Frederic II. swapped  the disk around  and
              that's it..."

VINCE CLOTHO "Members  today  are:  CAPTAIN  FUTURE, VINCE  CLOTHO, HD  CRASH &
              IMMORTALITY."


- What are your jobs in TUMULT and when have you joined in?

VINCE CLOTHO "My job is to compile and spread  the warez! I am also  one of the
              guys who organises  most of the new stuff. I get it directly from
              Crackers  or  Hacker-BBSes. I'm  also  doing  some  Ascii-Art for
              Tumult."

IMMORTALITY  "My job? It's  mostly spreading the new menus around the world and
              hoping  all the  freaks left  around in the world are getting the
              latest stuff."

CAPTAIN F.   "Writing new intros for the group I think... But thats mainly what
              Vince expects  from me... I don't really  have a job as Tumult is
              absolutely  triviality  for  me! I don't  take the  group  really
              serious and so I don't have any serious things to do."
	

- Is TUMULT the first group you were members of?

VINCE CLOTHO "No. I was a  member of a  black sect in  Babylon, 5000 years ago.
              We prayed to Ghoosa. Our  evil god. But then  our god  was locked
              beyond the  other side  and the  sect fell  apart. So after  some
              thousands of years  I decided  to join  another, even  more evil,
              possee. Tumult - Computer aided Crime!"

HD CRASH     "My first  group, I was a  member of  was  the 'Freedom for China-
              town'-clique. We had the aim to create an independent state which
              was not longer called a town but  Chinastate. Unfortunally  I was
              the only  member of  this  group, so  I gave up  this project and
              became a member of the  fishermen. But I always  got sick  when I
              entered a ship so I changed to Tumult"

IMMORTALITY  "The  Dinosaurus Card Club was  my first  group, somewhere  in the
              past. It wasn't very easy to stay alive back in that time. As you
              all  may know  a lot  of my  fellows  died, so  I had  to turn to
              another group. I have been in some group called 'How do I lose my
              overweight?', but that didn't work out and finally Tumult came...
              finally some  fellows who do understand the problems of an Atari-
              freak in the mid 90's."
              

- VINCE CLOTHO, can  you explain why you have chosen the name "SchlÅsselmeister
  von Ghoosa"? It's a very strange name I think...

VINCE CLOTHO "Yeah. You  surely know the  movie 'GHOSTBUSTERS'. Well there is a
              character  in  there. An  evil (but  I think  more  stupid) demon
              called VINCE CLOTHO (i don't know if the  spelling is correct but
              otherwise  no one  can kick  my ass for stealing a name! :-) This
              demon was the 'SchlÅsselmeister von Ghoosa'(Keymaster of Ghoosa).
              He always searched for the 'TorwÑchter'(Gatekeeper) and... hmm...
              the 'TorwÑchter' was  a naughty  bitch... and... maybe  I am also
              searching  for a 'TorwÑchter' :-))))))"
       
        
- Ok, what about a little review of your personal history? When you've  started
  with  computing  and  what  was  your  first  machine? What  is  your present
  equipment?

VINCE CLOTHO "I started  playing  videogames  on a  ATARI VCS 2600 when I was a
              child of ...9 or 10 years... must be on 1983 or so. For 3 years I
              only played but in 1986 i saw a machine in a german catalogue. It
              was an  ATARI 800 XL. I  thought 'I must  have this  machine' and
              some months later I got it! Guess what I did? I played games. But
              the few  games I  had weren't  enough. So piracy started in young
              years! Then  in 1989 I left  the computer business at all. I sold
              my machine and concentrated my mind on music and other things. In
              1990, music  brought me  back to the computer scene and because I
              am an old Atari-Freak I bought an ATARI 1040 STE, which I'm still
              using today. That's my present equipment! I also  have a harddisk
              and I  bought again  a new (old) ATARI 800 XL! Fucking  brilliant
              demos on this little machine!"
        
HD CRASH     "My first computer was the ATARI ST. Many years  later I converted
              to Falcon030 and I'm still there. Nothing strange about that"

IMMORTALITY  "It all started somewhere in beginning of the 80's. The  first one
              was called Philips Videopac. It was a  horrible one....but it was
              just the  beginning ofcourse. After  that Atari became part of my
              life  as  I  saw......the  Atari  800XL....whhhhoooooohhhh what a
              machine. I  played with  that  one for  some  years, until the ST
              came. I still have the ST. I  bought an Atari 130XE, about a year
              ago  and the two  brothers do  a damn  good job. Besides  the two
              Atari's I own a Pentium 166mhz......just for business....."

CAPTAIN F.   "I started  with  the  VCS 2600  that  I  still  use (for  playing
              Galaxian  mainly...).  Later  I  bought  following  things: C-64,
              1040STF, C128, 1040STF (coz my first broke  down), 1040STE (coz I
              expected something we never got: support), Mega STE (as a working
              station) and  finally I  also have a Jaguar (but without CD Rom).
              Today I don't have the Commodore stuff anymore and also I miss an
              old STF (my 2nd one has also been broken) but I think I'll buy an
              old one  again coz many  cool old games (and demos) don't work on
              STE's.
	
        
- TUMULT is  in my eyes  one of the  last ELITE-compact-groups  which can taken
  seriously in  my eyes. There  are original  intros (even  if you  use them to
  often...) and mostly hot stuff on them. What do you think about the other CD-
  groups around like The Ancient Celts, Pulse or The Braindead Bros?

VINCE CLOTHO "They are  all the  same! Ripped  Intros! Mostly old and uncracked
              stuff! We know some of them. The Ancient Celts are nice guys but,
              no own  intros. Britain has  nothing promising in common. All the
              same lame shit!"

CAPTAIN F.   "Ancient Celts were brilliant, not so boring like  younger people.
              I first  wanted to join them but then the creation of Tumult came
              in between this... Braindead Brothers  have class as they already
              existed  as many of  the today's readers of this mag have not yet
              got any  Atari... I don't care about groups who use other intros;
              the only  thing that counts is the stuff on the disks and the way
              it is presented... Thats my oppinion!!!"
        
IMMORTALITY  "Ofcourse  there's a lot  of old  shit on  them, but it  keeps the
              scene a little  more alive. The more people, the better the scene
              has to be....."


- Up to now TUMULT is  dependent on  the work  of the last cracking-groups like
  Elite or  Vectronix. Do you  have ever tried to crack a game  by yourself? If
  yes which game was  it and what  do you think  about the  protection you have
  removed this time?

HD CRASH     "The easiest protection are the key-protections, where you enter a
              key to  make the  sharewareversion  of a  program  become a  full
              version."

CAPTAIN F.   "We're  absolutely  independent!! Anyway  Vex and  Elite are cool.
              Respects!"


- What do you think about the cracking-scene in general?

IMMORTALITY  "Cracking has two sides.....One side is that you can look and play
              games & stuff  you might  want to buy.....on  the other side it's
              ofcourse illegal. But for god sake, due the cracking scene we all
              can  look at  the stuff  that  came  and still  comes out for the
              Atari."

CAPTAIN F.   "Right. Without cracking we all won't be here today, will we!?! In
              my opinion  the fucking  best Replicants  were ten-thousand times
              more  important  for the Atari-community all  around the world as
              those 'poor' companies like  Ocean Software... Home computers and
              cracked  games belong(ed) together  like party  and alcohol, life
              and death  or simply  Brazil and  football!!! Does anybody really
              believes  the todays situation  around  Atari would be any better
              when there have been more bought  and less  cracked games  in the
              past!?!?!"


- There are still coming games out for  the ST. If this last  softwareflow will
  trickle away finaly will TUMULT change to the Falcon or quit the CD-work?

VINCE CLOTHO "Some of us still have Falcons!"

CAPTAIN F.   "...and  maybe  we  will  buy new  coming TOS computers someday...
              (when there come any...)"


- Ok, I've  some words  now and  you should  give me  a single  word or a short
  clause.
  What do you thinking about...

- Amiga 

VINCE CLOTHO "In 1986-1992, Shit! But today good, 'coz Motorola inside!"

HD CRASH     "Nice hardware, lotsa  games, unfortunally  as dead  as the ST. At
              least no Intel CPU."

IMMORTALITY  "Nice games and hardware, but all the nerds that own one !?!?!:"

CAPTAIN F.   "I think Amiga users were better in racing games than Atari users,
              but the  Atari users were  better in thinking games and shoot-em-
              ups!!!"


- Atari

VINCE CLOTHO "Finally  dead. Or will  JTS  kick our  asses  sometime? I believe
              not!"

HD CRASH     "Great hardware and crap management."

CAPTAIN F.   "Dead. Pity. History. Memories. Lifestyle."

IMMORTALITY  "WWWHHHHHOOOOOOOHHHHHH, what  a  great  computers, but  somehow it
              went wrong somewhere the last years.....till it finally died."


- Cracking

VINCE CLOTHO "Good. Because some cracked versions of games are even better then
              the fucking original. For example Civilisation by Vectronix!"

HD CRASH     "My method of learning assembler: Learning by cracking ;-)"

IMMORTALITY  "Tell me what's wrong about it?"


- Siliconvention '97

VINCE CLOTHO "We will be there. As Undercover agents!"

HD CRASH     "I hope it will be a big party"

IMMORTALITY  "GREAT!"


- Elite

VINCE CLOTHO "The group or the status? The  group: starving. To have  an Elite-
              status is cool!"

IMMORTALITY  "Once they the best..."


- Internet

VINCE CLOTHO "Good! Piracy in Megabytes!"

HD CRASH     "Lotsa hype. Too slow for megabytes"

IMMORTALITY  "The future...but it has to become much faster and bigger."

CAPTAIN F.   "Nice but not amazing. Overrated."


- Jaguar

CAPTAIN F.   "Cool!  Bought "Towers II"  now. I  hope  some  more  titles  will
              follow!!! ...but as all Atari stuff: no support!"

VINCE CLOTHO "Dead! Sad but true! It's a good machine but hard to code!"

HD CRASH     "Tempest 2k!!!"

IMMORTALITY  "It's better then the other ones....but where did it go wrong?!?!"


- Lamers

VINCE CLOTHO "Still to many on earth. And even in our scene!"

HD CRASH     "We all start as lamers. Most stay lame"

CAPTAIN F.   "Lamer is the  synonym for PC-user. We're all no lamers because we
              hate PC's... Once there were many lamers on Atari, too, but today
              they're  all gone... Lamers are playing the 10000th Doom-Clone on
              their  silly  PC's, usually  they're very, very boring and stupid
              individuals with little characters only. I've pity with lamers."

IMMORTALITY  "I'm not one of them I hope."


- Nintendo 64

VINCE CLOTHO "I don't believe that this will kick the Playstation's ass!"

HD CRASH     "Hype. Is it good because it's from big N?"

IMMORTALITY  "Nice, but it still is a Nintendo."


- Pentium

VINCE CLOTHO "Useless. 'coz Intel build it!"

HD CRASH     "Sucks by definition. The biggest hardwarepatch ever seen."

IMMORTALITY  "As we all know the Motorolla based computers are still better."


- Scene on the ST

VINCE CLOTHO "Oh. It's still here but most of the guys are sleeping!"

HD CRASH     "May the force be with them."

IMMORTALITY  "If we keep  the faith, it will still be there. Look  at the ATARI
              XL-scene...it is still there."

C.F.         "Dead."


- Scene on the Falcon
  
VINCE CLOTHO "Hm. The situation is the same as on the ST!"

HD CRASH     "Better chance for smaller groups."

IMMORTALITY  "I hoped it would be better."


- Symposium '96 (If you were there...)

HD CRASH     "Not enough  space for the  ATARI-scene. FB4 would  have  been the
              better choice."


- The OLD Undercover (hehehe)

HD CRASH     "Cool."


- Diskmags in general

VINCE CLOTHO "They are important to inform the scene what's going on!"

IMMORTALITY  "Great, still some ways left to see what happens in the scene."

CAPTAIN F.   "Good platform!"


- Scene-charts (Do we need them?)
  
VINCE CLOTHO "In the past: YES. Today: NO! But I will vote!" 

IMMORTALITY  "Are there any candidates left to vote for?"

CAPTAIN F.   "Today Bullshit! I don't see a sense in it.."


- Windows 95

VINCE CLOTHO "Hiroshima 45, Tschernobyl 86, Windows 95!"

HD CRASH     "Argl! Lame OS for lame users!"

IMMORTALITY  "We all make mistakes!"

CAPTAIN F.   "Vince gave the correct answer. Not really impressive, but its the
              same phenomen as DJ Bobo: Popular!!!"


- Vectronix

VINCE CLOTHO "Metallinos Schmittmann is cool! PHATT RESPECT!"

CAPTAIN F.   "Replicants' grandchildren."


- Do you have a last message for our readers?

VINCE CLOTHO "If I ever buy a PC, I will never buy any programs!"

HD CRASH     "Stay cool. Or at least try too ;-)"

CAPTAIN F.   "Take care and enjoy !!!"


- Ok, thanx in advance and good luck for your further project!
