Yes, we have here another  nibble-game. This time it's a bit older but from the
gods of game-making... I will  not write anything about  the game-princip here,
just read  my article about  the game "SLIPPERY SAM", if you  really don't know
something about the nibble-games (If it's so, poor guys).
This game is a bit older and was  released last year  together with some  other
games of the same kind (sorry, I had another one here, called ADDER, but I have
lost the copy and no time to get it back before releasing this mag...).
SWORMS is a typical  RESERVOIR GODS game. It's  colourful, contains  good musix
and  sound-effects and  last but  not least it's a bit strange  as always. This
time  you can not play only on  2D-playfield. No, also  in 3D! And this is very
strange because the control is very tricky. It's only for hardcore-nibbler. But
because the cube you playing on is very  slow (texture-mapped) it could be also
a bit easier in this way as the 2D-arena.
In this  game you cannot smash against walls, because  there aren't any. If you
reach the border your worm appears on the other side of  the screen and this is
really confusing if your worm is longer than 100 tiles.
Also in  this game there is a bonus-option included. You chose if you want them
or not. If yes there appearing some little boxes on the screen. When you
collect them it could be  that your worm grows  without getting points, or your
worm shrinks, there appearing some obstacles or something like that.
Another point is that you can chose between 5 different levels. This means that
you play each level as lang as  you live. There aren't any level-changes in the
game itself (as in SLIPPERY SAM).
Hum, other things to say? No I don't think so.
All in one it's a typical RG-game, colourfull, loud, crazy. The only thing I've
missed is a  saveable highscore. I will  the nearly not existing playability of
the 3D-field count as minus, because you  must not play it. I see it more as an
original feature for the toughest guys... So  there is only to mention that the
highscore-list would be the coronation  of the game. Without  the motivation is
all other as very big to play the game more as only one time... sorry.
If you like RG-games you'll love SWORMS!
