                                "IT'S NO GOOD"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

maxi-single, released by MUTE Records 1997

After  the two "BARREL OF A GUN" maxi-singles (original  and remix) this is the
third DeMo-release  this year and I must say it leaves a split impression in my
mind. But before I come to my critics I will mention the contents of this CD:

1 - It's No Good
2 - Slowblow - Darren Price Mix
3 - It's No Good - Bass Bounce Mix
4 - It's No Good - Speedy J Mix

(the remix-single contains the original-version of "SLOWBLOW" several mixes)

Hum. The title-song is great, no question. It remembers a bit to the "old" DeMo
and is in the style of  the "VIOLATOR" and "S.O.F.A.D." album. It's a very slow
song, but with  the wellknown impressive voice of Dave (this time not stretched
or pitched) and driving beats and also a bit more electronic... only cool...
But please don't  take a look at the video to this song! It's shit! If you will
see what's  going on in this  little piece  of crap  you would  buy a shovel to
smash it on  Dave's head! I don't  care about the  meaning of the clip but it's
only ugly, especially Dave's outfit... bleurgh...
The mix of "SLOWBLOW" is very  slow (erm... you  always know this or why it has
this name?!) and it's an instrumental piece.
The BASS BOUNCE MIX  of the title-track  sounds a bit strange but has also some
good passages. The bassdrum is very deep and so the song has a very good vibe.
BUT, the SPEEDY J MIX  is pure shit! It's not understandable why DeMo releasing
a breakbeat-mix! It sounds sometimes like older pieces of THE PRODIGY or so and
if you wouldn't hear Dave's voice you had surely not thought that this is a mix
of a DeMo-song... bleurgh... I'm a  Depeche-Fan, no question, and I'm also very
tolerant  but all things have a frontier and here this frontiers are absolutely
gone...
Ok, now I'm  waiting for "ULTRA" and  also for the  new Singles-Collection with
the singles of 1985-today and also the Best-Of-Compilation in the next year...
And it could  be that DeMo will go on tour to promote the Best-Of in 1998! I'll
be there!
