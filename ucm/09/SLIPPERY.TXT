This game was  packed to the  new mag FUNSCAPE 1.5 and so I will take a look on
it for you.
I think you all know this kind of games. You have a little snake and must crawl
around on the screen to eat some pills  or something  like that. With each pill
your snake getting longer and longer. But you cannot cross your body or stop or
touch the walls and obstacles because you will die if you do  this. So there is
a kind of strategy needed to survive  as long as possible  and to get the high-
score or at least the next level.
The same for this game. With  each level you  have to eat  more pills and there
appearing  more obstacles. If you have eaten  a pill there appearing  different
objects on the screen. At one hand  there are some power-pills and at the other
there are some poisonous mushrooms. You have to eat the  power-pills before the
mushrooms because  you will die if don't have the energy. By eating  a mushroom
your snake becomes  very slow and if you eat  too many mushrooms  after another
the game is over or at least one live lost.
Ok, that's it.
The game features  nice grafix, but it  seems as they were drawn  on a ST or at
least with a ST-paint-tool 'cause  they contain only 16  colours. I think for a
Falcon-only-game this is all other as state of the art. For a ST-game the grafx
would be ok, but for a Falcon-game... no way.
Better is the  sound. You  have 3  different  Amiga-chip-modules  and a  lot of
sampled sound. Not bad.
The control is ok and you  have to choice of keyboard, joypad or stick. I think
the keyboard is the best.
The highscore isn't  saveable and this  isn't good for  the motivation. So it's
only a game for the coffebreak or something like that.
All in one the game isn't bad and makes also a lot of fun, at least for an half
hour or so. But  with better  grafix and a  highscore which would  be saved the
whole game would be reach a better score  as only mediocre, especially as there
are a lot of other nibble-games around.
