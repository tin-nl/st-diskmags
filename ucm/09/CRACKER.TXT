                         CRACKER CHARTS - YES OR NO?!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you know the cracking-scene is very down and sometimes we thought that it is
useless to make charts for  this part of the scene, because there aren't enough
living bands  and guys left to make  an actual  list. It's really  senseless to
read only dead names in the charts.
But we have included them to look who's number one and who's not. This is in my
eyes very important because the last survivors say all that  they're the number
one and it isn't possible to have 3 no.1-bands... no question.
But now we have recieved some messages of guys which are thinking that we don't
need cracking-charts, but not because  of their sense... no, they  want that we
should boykott this part  of the scene, because they're the gravediggers of the
last view Atarian's...
The reactions about the illegal charts reaching from a simple statement against
this charts up to messy abuses...
So I ask you: Should we include  illegal charts also in the future? Please tell
us what you  think about them! Just tell us, if you think we  need them, if you
would tolerate them  or if you don't want to see them again. Just put your mess
to your votesheet and we  will tell you all, how we will go on... But remember,
the majority decides...
So take your pen or keyboard and tell us your opinion!
