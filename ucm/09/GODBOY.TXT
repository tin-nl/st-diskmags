                                GODBOY-CORNER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first I wanted to open a new area in the UCM but than I have decided to pack
the reviews of the GODBOY-games in only one article...
Hum, the RESERVOIR GODS have matched it to release a very good emulation of the
bestselling Nintendo-handheld and I had never thought that it makes fun to play
the games on this emulation, 'cause  I own a Falcon  with truecolor  and so one
and I had never thought that it could make fun to play games with a handfull of
colours on a very little  screen... But since  the release of  SUPER MARIO LAND
I have  started the GODBOY  much more  as the  Falcon-games... And I think this
shows that a game  must not only feature  brilliant grafix and massive sound to
be addictive...

Yep, here it is, the first game for the GAMEBOY-emulation made by the RESERVOIR
GODS. Ok, at one point I wonder why they have chosen  this game for converting,
because the MARIO-games are more GAMEBOY-typical, but who cares.
They have released the well-known jump'n'run from OCEAN for this thing and even
if there  isn't much stuff left from the  original GAMEBOY-game (sampled sound,
new soundtrack  and 7 (boaa =) ...) colours, start-menu with trainer-option and
so one it brings the feeling of this machine to the Falcon, no question.
It's a new experience to see  only a very little  part of the  screen, with big
pixels and only a few colours, only very simple animations and so one.
But it makes a lot of fun to play it, no question.
This conversion of BUBBLE BOBBLE  is a bit buggy  and so  you have some grafic-
errors on the screen and it's a bit sloooow.
Hm. Another point  I have missed is  the two-player-mode as the game has on the
ST or Falcon.
Ok, it isn't a bad conversion  but I think it would be better  to convert games
we don't  have on  ST or Falcon. I must  really  say that  I prefer  the DOUBLE
BOBBLE game on the Falcon as this one.

This release is up to now the most disappointing game. You have to jump and fly
around on a screen to collect bombs. There  are some enemies around and if come
in contact with them you will  die. Nothing more  to say. As I can  remember on
the ST you had to collect the bombs in a  special order (they  start to burning
and if collect the burning bombs one after the other you will get more points).
The soundtrack  to this game isn't  bad but goes on your nerves after only some
minutes. Ok, there  aren't gfx-bugs as in the first game, but for  me this game
is extremely boring and I don't wanted to  play for longer  time. I have played
it on my ST some years ago for many  hours. Eventually because of this  I'm not
interested to play this conversion as long as other games, don't know.
But for me it is totally superfluous...
I will not write more about it... just forget it.

Finally here  we have a good game  on the GODBOY! I think all  of you know this
game or you have all played it on another system or one of the many conversions
of this game, like "GIANA SISTERS" or "STARIO LAND".
Ok, it  doesn't  feature  a two-player-mode  as "GIANA SISTERS" but  it's  much
better as the STARIO-conversion on the ST, at least this is my opinion.
You don't have any grafix-errors  anymore, the  game is much  faster as the two
others together, the control is ok and the sound is great.
As I had  got this game  I have played it for  about one hour at the first time
and by my limited time this is very much. But this game  is very addictive  and
as I remember it was the foundation of the victory of the Nintendo-consoles. So
get this game  and go with the little plumber out to  rescue the princess. Even
if the  game is very  simple, the  enemies very  calculateable it is incredible
funny and you will spend some hours for sure while playing this game.
It's sad that NINTENDO has heard of the GODBOY and tries to  stop the R.GODS...
I hope that we will see much more games for this emulation...
