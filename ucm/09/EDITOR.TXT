Hello again!

At first you surely  wonder why this mag is presented by the names of .tnb. and
.tSCc. and it isn't a problem to solve this little mystery. Because of the cool
help of  the .tSCc.gang  we have  decided to  credit them in  this way. Without
their friendly  help we  had  never matched it  to bring the UCM to the present
glory. It would be still the same boring craptalk-mag as in the last few years.

This time the UCM isn't as good as promised. We could not hold  our promises to
improve the whole shell and there were only a few fixes made. This time we also
have no intro because Drizzt had not the time and the motivation to code one.
He  must start his civilian service  and so he  has lost  many motivation to do
something for .tnb. and so we have again some problems.
But I'm  very happy that we could manage it to release this issue of the UCM at
the promised time  and I'm sure  that also  the following mags will come on the
announced dates and so the next one will be released  in autumn (perhaps at the
end of September) and we will release also an issue for Xmas (but not a special
one as last year). Don't know  if we will  release special-issues  between this
dates, just wait.
But let us take a look at  the present  situation of  the scene. After the very
weak last  year the whole scene  comes back to life again and besides 4 summer-
parties we have a lot of releases around, even if the scene still  shrinks. But
because the last survivors in each country working better  together it looks as
the scene is growing again... And perhaps we will see sometimes  more people on
the old ST and Falcon again because to see what's going on today could motivate
the one or other to come back to this wonderful machines.
What can you read in this issue of Undercover?! Yo, we have MASSES of stuff for
you! So we  have tons  of interviews  with divers people  of the  scene and the
first signs of the big summer-parties in France and Poland.
The demo-corner contains only some  of reviews because there wasn't  much stuff
released since  the SILICON and  also the NAS'97 has  not brought  the stuff we
have hoped for. 
Alone our  music-corner  is bigger  as the  corners of  the UCM 7 & 8 together,
because there were many  new electronic-albums  around, for example the ones by
And One and Depeche Mode, and these things must be mentioned here...
You will  surely notice that our music-corner gets darker and darker and if you
think it is too  single-sided you  should do  something against  this because I
will only test electronic/darkwave and gothic-stuff in the future, besides some
other  stuff... but  I will not test  techno-stuff  anymore, because  I'm not a
technotic anymore.
Another corner is now reality: our CODING CORNER, or better LAMERS HEAVEN =) is
on the road and we will try to get also for the next  issues skilled coders who
can show you a little bit of their stuff. If you have any wishes please tell us
what you  want to see  in the next issue (if  you want to know  something about
different effex or if you  have some  problems). For  this corner  I must thank
MIKE of STAX and LLAMA of .tSCc. because without  their help  this corner would
never become  reality... But if you  think you have also a nice effect coded on
ST or Falcon (especially this machine, because MIKE and LLAMA are ST-oriented),
please get in touch with us (several adds are included) because  so we can make
the LAMERS HEAVEN to the most interesting place in this magazine, for ALL guys!
Other theme... the first after-SILICON-party is over and, erm... the NAS'97 was
not the awaited event... After  many party-releases last  year this year it was
only disappointing. The last big  party in scandinavia was  only a little show,
without demo-releases and so one. Ok, a few inferior screens were released, but
after the  last year (Crystal  Demo, B.F.O.S. demo, ICEver  and the  other  hot
things) we had  waited for  better stuff... Don't know  what's going on  in the
scandinavian  ATARI-scene... I've the feeling  that this  part of the  scene is
dying  silently... Ok, the  DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY is  still  active, but  what's
going on with all the others? Where are NO CREW, AGGRESSION, LYNX, ICE, EXTREAM
and all the others from  the northern  scene?! While here in  middle-Europe the
scene is still active we don't hear or see much of our northern mates...
Hey guys! Give  us a  lifesign! It isn't  time to stop yet! Grab your keyboards
and code  us some brainblasting stuff! We know that you're able to do some cool
things! Support  the ST- and  Falcon-scene! Kick the dumb PC-fuckers in her ass
and stay on ATARI!
OK, I will  not write more here, all the interesting things you can find in the
mag itself... Sorry  for this confusing lines, but we have about 30 degrees out
there and the water is dripping down from my forhead... =)

It's summer! So read fast and than go out and smash you body into the next lake
or sea or something else! 

             C ya in autumn, when the weather isn't as good as today anymore
                and you spend more time with your computer again...
