                                STARHAWK II
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                

...is the sequel of "Cobra Strike" from British  gamemakers "Serious Software".
In most cases, the sequel of  a game is better than  the first part. (Want some
examples? Just  take  a  look  at  Lethal Xcess - WOD 2, Turrican II or, on PC,
Maniac Mansion II and  Monkey  Island II...) Unfortunately "STARHAWK" got  even
worse than Cobra Strike. The  game-principle stayed  the same, the  movement of
the enemies wasn't changed, so they still move  very artificial. The only thing
that  was  changed are  the graphics. The  whole  game _now_ plays  on an other
planet, the enemies  are spaceships, you are firing with a laser-cannon and the
ground-structures  are  looking more  futuristic. But the  bad control  of your
player has been not changed. So please just read the test of "Cobra Strike" and
transform it to "Starhawk". There are no  differences between those  two except
for the graphics, which are a real shame. To be  honest, I think  it would take
_me_ about five or six  hours to  draw such  stuff with  CrackArt. The  thing I
really do not  understand is, why some  game creators do not  invest more  time
into their graphics. Do they think that gfx aren't so important  for a game? Or
are they not  able to paint better  things? I really don't understand it! A bit
more of dithering, a more intelligent use of colours  and some more  time to do
the graphics would  have a favourable effect on those games. "Starhawk" looks -
seen from the eyes of a graphician - like a game from the 80s, maybe  even on a
C64. After such great shot'em ups like  Wings of Death  and Xenon II  everybody
should  have recognized  how a _good_ shooter  has to  look  like. And  if some
coders, like Serious Software, do not make any effort, they have  to expect bad
criticisms. In the end: I wonder who has THAT strong nervers to play this game.
I would say that there are limits in masochism. ;))
