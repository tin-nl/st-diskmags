Yep, here we go. Today I had the possibility to take a little look to the pixel
painting-prog  from CRAZY BITS. It isn't  a deeper  review, 'cause I hadn't the
time and motivation  to check out all  the functions and possibilities  of this
tool, but I think I can give you at least some little information.
At first some  general info. The  program runs  on all TOS-machines and  in all
resolutions and it runs under GEM (...). It is, as I had written above, a pixel
oriented painting-program.
The program  contains many  features and  besides the usual painting-tools like
pen, boxes, circles, poly-lines  and bezier-curves  there are  some interesting
things I will  mention here. So you have also something like a water-effect. If
you use this the pixels of the chosen area will be mixed up a little bit.
You have  also all  the usual  cut-functions (boxes  and "Lasso-Cut") but  they
don't reach the ones of the good old NEOmaster.
The text-function  is very good  and you  can use  also GDOS and Signum2-fonts.
The program features also an online-help (if 1ST-Guide is installed).
There is also scanner and grafic-tablet-stuff included.
The program understands a lot of several  picture-formats and can load at least
the usual ATARI-formats (Degas and NeoChrome) and  also IFF, TIF (but not all),
GIF, TGA and others. Unfortunately  the program  was broken  down, after I have
tried to load  a very  big TGA-file. It shows the info that the picture doesn't
fit into the memory and than the whole system was slowed down to sero. fuck.
The save-function isn't as good. There are only a few formats  included, as the
several Degas-formats, IMG, IFF, TIF, EMS, PCX, PIX and BMP.
Other things to mention? Hum, the magnify  can be in  realtime (but a bit slow)
and in the usual way (you will  see you action  only at the  magnify-window and
after this on the screen).
The program  uses also  pop-up menus, features  colour-blending and  stuff like
1:1-resolution up to full-screen.
More stuff? Hum, it converts all the  pictures  by loading. It  seems that they
use  -Floyd Steinberg-  routines,  because  the  pictures  looking  very  after
converting even if there is a lack of more as 2oo colours.
Ok, nothing more to say. This program isn't bad, but it doesn't  reach the most
so called  Freak-programs like  the old ST-ones (CrackArt and NeoChrome Master)
or the new Falcon-stuff (Escape-Paint, God-Paint, Indypaint and so one).
Another bad point is the real high price. It will cost about 6o pounds / 18o DM
and this  is too  much, at  least  for  me. But for  what we  have the good old
cracker-posse ;) thanx  to VEX! But in spite of it I will not use it. There are
better programs around, at least I think so.
Ok, for  all the  GEM-fanatics  PiXART isn't  a bad choice, but I don't like it
very much. Ups, and  for  the english users. Even if I had the  english version
for testing there are still loads of german words used, don't know why.
