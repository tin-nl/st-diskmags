All right  it's again your plastic pal who's fun  to be with called MC Laser of
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation  reporting live  for you  directly  from the
warzone. DOWWWNNNNN! Puh, that was close! As an atarian inhabitant you all know
those  black  bombs which  are appearing  when  something  fails. Now, THEY ARE
EVERYWHERE!!!...In the last weeks a war has started on the scene.

A war  between -> FARAMIR/ELiTE < and > PHOENIX/VECTRONIX <-! Faramir  attacked
Phoenix by releasing a textphile under the ELiTE-Flag called WHY VEX SUXX.
He argued that Phoenix is a traitor who is trying to  kill the scene by pushing
the PC. After  this Phoenix  wrote an  answer  but without  involving Vectronix
(What I personely consider as a very good move). On this Faramir answered again
with mostly the same arguments like in his first threat!

All those  texts can  be found  elsewhere in  this issue  of Undercover. My own
personal view from that little ridiculousness will be given to you right now! 

It's totally  stupid from an  atarian to attack another atarian! We are a dying
race and should support each other as good as we can! I share the hate  and the
rejection  against PC's with Faramir but we all use them somewhere in our life.
Maybe on  our work, the  Internet or  whatever. But If you are really into  the
computerscene, you  know  that  INTEL  and  MICROSOFT  are the worst. An INTEL-
Trashcan can only be seen as a SLAVE for the real crowd! 

It would  be nice  if other parties  would tell us their view on that thing. We
keep on  eye on the scene  of crime and  inform you about the next steps of the
two opponents. 

Btw, aliens ARE here. We are the prove! Sirius will take Terra over! :-)))

Signing off,

editors note: Yep, as  MC Laser had  written that  you will find the textphiles
              about this  childish "war" somewhere in the UCM  I've put them in
              here... read now  the facts in chronological order... BTW: I also
              can't  understand some  guys use  the smallest  possibilities  to
              attack  another one. A little  word to  FARAMIR: PHOENIX supports
              the ATARI-scene  with his  PC and the Heaven's Trash much more as
              you will ever do it with such stupid textfiles! Think about it!

                compiled and released by faramir on 29 april 1997

fellow atarians at  war for survival against the tyranny of mirco$oft, too much
is too much! vectronix, lead  by phoenix, not  having enough  of provocation by
passing on pc, treat atari of a dead computer, and loving the wealth of windoze
95, passed a  gear up in betrayal  at the atari scene. this is merely personal.
this is rather  strategical. and i think  a scene with  the throat half cut can
bother with strategical moves of its sceners. 
                                                                  faramir/elite

here's an extract from vex' latest crk release:

 ³  We would like to welcome our new member, Senser which will work for us   ³
 ³  as ascii/ansi artist. You'll see example of his work together with our   ³
 ³  new releases! Senser will bring even more quality to our group!          ³
 ³                                                                           ³
 ³  Due to lack of time, school exams and work, motivation, and activity on  ³
 ³  the atari scene we have have been a bit lazy for a while, and we know    ³
 ³  it! Only fools cannot admit that the atari scene is very much dead, but  ³
 ³  we will continue to support atari as long as there is a need, so don't   ³
 ³  count us out yet! As far as I know we're the only group which still      ³
 ³  releases new commercial software for the atari.                          ³
 ³                                                                           ³

only traitors tell themselves (and others) atari is dead. as far as i know, you
are a weak  traitor selling yourself to the enemy. or perhaps were you never an
atarian? atari isn't dead. and you're not the would-be last atarian sceners you
pretend to be in order to take more atarians with you to hell.

<[Phoenix]> oops: it's lame of release anything without file_id.diz_es....
<Flinny> Phoenix : http://www.flinny.demon.co.uk/files/cab_ovl/cab_ovl.lzh
<[Phoenix]> flinny: thx.. got it....
<Oops2_> hm.. bbs software should get the description from the comment in
the archive
<Flinny> Oops : there aint one :)
ajje [ajje@wombat.ludvika.se] has joined #atari
<ajje> rehuj
<[Phoenix]> oops: file_id.diz'es purpose are just to be, THE description for
 bbses....
<[Phoenix]> oops: atari must be the onlty platform which not everyone uses
 it...
<ethhoack> phoenix: dizes are for pc board wankers, it's not a standard at
all ...
<[Phoenix]> ethoack: say what? you are _quite_ missinformed....
<ethhoack> phoenix: if you were pure and never touched a pc, you wouldn't
even know what's a file_id.diz
<[Phoenix]> ethoack: blah... you don't know what you're talking about...
every fucking bbs program in the world supports file_id.dizes....
<Oops2_> phx: right.. I know what they are for.. but it's a lame idea to
begin with..
<ethhoack> phoenix: i know that, i used pcb before you, but file_id.diz is
a standard only on pc
<Oops2_> the descriptions should be in the comment of the archive format..
eg zip comment.. lzh comment etc..
<ethhoack> yeah right
<[Phoenix]> oops: is it? what's wrong with that the author always gets the
same desciption of his files uploaded anywhere? I guess you have never been
 a sysop, you should see the descriptions people enter for the files they
 upload.....
<Oops2_> I have been.. people usually enter crap descriptions..
<[Phoenix]> ethoack: ratsoft supports file_id.diz, ami express does it...
it's NOT for PC only...
<Oops2_> but.. the descriptions should be got from the comment of
the archive.. not a file in the archive..
<Oops2_> just another lame PC standard we are stuck with..
<[Phoenix]> oops. the comment of archives change! and people repacks stuff
before uplading...
<[Phoenix]> oops: it's not a fucking PC standard....
<Oops2_> ppl should not repack stuff
<ethhoack> phoenix: it's not a reason to piss on ppl who don't use it
<[Phoenix]> oops: nope, they shuldn't... but they do...
<[Phoenix]> ethoack: no... but I nuke files not carrying a diz.. so it's
their choice...
realTINO [__@line15.netwave.de] has joined #atari
<ethhoack> phoenix: so there is no choice but yours
<Oops2_> if they didn't repack stuff.. and put description in the comment of

<Flinny> Tino!
<loke> Hehe... If you say "mirc" on #Linux you get kicked by the bot. :-)
<realTINO> heya again
<realTINO> Flinny!
<[Phoenix]> opps: then, how do you get the comment of an archive, is there
an easy way to do that? which both lzh, zip, arj, rar etc supports?
<Flinny> loke : haha cool :)
Flinny votes for an MIRC kick <G> (please dont hit me:))
<Oops2_> phx: yep.. all decent packers have a command to do that
<[Phoenix]> oops: which command is that?
realTINO [__@line15.netwave.de] has left #atari (realTINO)
<Oops2_> phx: you have to config it for each packer.. just like you must
config the extract file command for each packer
<ethhoack> phoenix: there is a simple way, which is to remember the file
 desc, and type it manually everytime you trade the file, write down descs
  on paper with a pen, but you sure don't understand that anymore, you
   prefer using diz and the fucking lame and shitty windoze notepad, and
   let mirco$oft rule your life which you sold to them !! why don't you just
   leave here and join #windows95 and #mirchelp, where everyone will agree
    with you ?
<[Phoenix]> oops: no problem... just tell me the commands for ZIP and LZH...
<[Phoenix]> ethoack: I'm sick and tired of you, and the atari "scene"...
therefore, I'm leaving...

--...here comes PHOENIX' answer...---------------------------------------------

"Elite presents why vex suxxx", "fuck off vectronix"

This is an answer  to Elite's official  threat to Vectronix, atleast that's the
impression you can get by reading it....

--

Faramir, you  childish leader of Elite. What really, do you think you're doing?
Not only that you  cannot keep our little disputes private, but you have to get
VeX involved  in it too, and make  it an official threat coming from Elite as a
group? You have NO backup from them for this!

To point some of the incorrect things out from your little message, I'm not the
leader  of VeX. Even  though if we  maybe not have any obvious leader, as we're
all friends  and respect  each others, and  make most  decisions together, both
Metallinos and  Hardball for example, is more obvious choice of leader than me.
VeX works  as a group, we're  having fun together and we like each others, just
like it should be. But I guess you don't know what that is like!

The  logfiles  you put  in this  shit  makes  people think  this is all about a
file_id.diz argument, but  it's not. It's  simply that you cannot accept that I
have a  PC now, just  like yourself, all  Vectronix members, and most old atari
users  today. I don't see  the purpose of those logs, I have much funnier logs,
emails, textfiles  from our little conversations, but for your own sake I don't
think you want them to be public....

I also want  to point it out  that we have nothing against Elite as group, this
is strictly private  between me  and you  Faramir, so  leave both  parts out of
this! I  don't understand  why you  had to  make  such a  big deal  out of this
anyway, but now I have had enough of you!

Can't you  get it  into your little mind that you are the one not wanted on the
atari scene, or is so full of shit concerning aliens, satan, microsoft etc that
there's  no space  for anything  else? They  don't  even want  you  on the #ufo
channels strangely enough!

The members  of your  group don't want  you, atleast two members have left only
because of you. Nobody in your group have ever listened to you, and never will.
You're  dragging Elite  down in the  shit, and  you  better start  realizing it
before it's  too late. Open your  fucking eyes, wake up from your dreamland and
face the reality for a change!

I expect you to  step down from the  leadership in Elite, and/or that the other
members kick  you out of the group. I think it's sad that someone like you have
the responsibility for a group like Elite. If Sledge knew what you are doing to
his old group he would not be happy, that's for sure!

Then, what the  FUCK have you  contributed with  to keep the atari scene alive?
I'm quite sure about that the releases I did this weekend is more than you have
ever  done! Or do  you  want  me  to  count  alien  compendiums, craptalk about
Microsoft  and threats to  other groups? Then  if you are such a fucking PC and
Microsoft fanatic yourself, why complain at others? Or, was I wrong again?
You're strictly on Atari yourself? Yeah, right.... ;-)

I say it  again Faramir, you  better step  down from your position in Elite, or
things will get a dramatically change here.....

See you  on #atari Faramir! Ohhh, I forgot, you're not wanted there either, and
you don't  have access  anymore... It's  not the first time you get banned from
there either, you on of the most loyal atarians? haha....

Statements  in this text  are my own  and does not involve Vectronix, no matter
how much they might agree to it... ;-)

vexsuxxx.zip isn't a threat, it's a denunciation of your vicious policy.

and proud to be it!

it's not  about "our little disputes", it's  about atari  in the computing, and
it's about  computing  related to the  world take-over  done by mirco$oft, it's
serious matter, because computing is the future, and our behaviours have heavey
consequences.

we work the same way in elite.

>VeX works as  a group, we're having fun together and we like each others, just

elite as  a crew concern  each other  members  too, marcer  and  myself  submit
decision to members votes.

it's not indeed. it's what about follows.

the matter  isn't about  having a  pc. the matter  is about pushing atarians to
abandon atari to the pc. there's a huge difference. besides, i only quoted your
public statements. i didn't quote any of your private statements.

i don't log any private chat anyway. i have respect for my interlocutors.

i only keep e-mails of practical use.

because you  love windoze and what surrounds, which is a very bad sign. windoze
is shit, you can't  be an atarian  and liking windoze garbage at the same time,
or you're  a traitor. i use a pc with windoze on it just to go on the internet,
and for  nothing  else. my  tt is  my main  machine. my pc  is just an internet
browser. i hate  windoze, i hate m$, i  hate bill gates but i've to use windoze
to go on the net and fight evilness on earth.

>channels strangely enough!

i did release  one of two things  about aliens and m$ under the elite banner in
the past, but don't do it anymore. it's not adapted.

aliens are here for real.

satan is corrupting humans for real.

mirco$oft is taking over the world for real.

why calling  these matters  shit? i'd say  there is  shit in your  eyes, or you
don't want  to have your  qietness  bothered with  stuff that'd  call upon your
responsibilities and care for others (if you have any).

about  the #ufo channel, i don't  know where you did go fetch this. i'm welcome
on the #ufo channel, i  got banned  several time last year on us efnet #ufo for
front-attacking people preaching bowing down in front of the aliens, but that's
all. most of ppl on #ufo channels like me.

>The members of your  group don't want you, atleast  two members have left only
>because of you. 

strata left because  i pointed the  ambuiguity of  being in 2 crews at the same
time. pervert  left after because stratagem left. the other members want me, or
else  they'd have  told me so. may  be people don't  like my  aggressivity. but
everybody likes the result.

>Nobody in your group have ever listened to you, and never will.

you don't know what you're talking about. members consent my decisions, which i
never take  alone, so there's no  problem. elite is more an  international crew
than vex, so it works differently.

>You're  dragging Elite  down in the  shit, and  you better  start realizing it
>before it's  too late. Open your fucking eyes, wake up from your dreamland and
>face the reality for a change!

you're  dragging  the atari  scene into  the void, and  denouncing  your shitty
policy gets  our hands full of shit indeed, and if we let you do we become your
accomplices.

when you clean a copper pan, you rub the dirt for minutes before getting to the
bright copper.

>I expect you  to step down from the leadership in Elite, and/or that the other
>members kick you out of the group. 

i already give marcer  lots of autonomy, because i can't deal with the crew all
the month long (ie when i work).

>I think it's sad  that someone  like you have  the responsibility  for a group
>like Elite. 

what u're doing  is trying to split us up by changing subject. your policy is a
betrayal, and  you obviously don't want ppl to know it. you want atarians to go
for the pecoss. and you want them to be ruled by you, you whou "saved them from
sticking to a dead computer all their live".

>If Sledge knew  what you are  doing to  his old group  he would  not be happy,
>that's for sure!

i'm just taking my responsibilities. which bothers traitors like you !

>Then, what the FUCK have you contributed with to keep the atari scene alive?

ever heard about central europe? huh?

>I'm quite sure  about that the  releases I did  this weekend is  more than you
>have ever done! 

we have several  recent releases too, but  you don't check them anymore, so you
say bull, and it gets your mouth dirt.

>Or do you  want me to  count alien  compendiums, craptalk  about Microsoft and
>threats to other groups? 

these don't count as releases. do they?

>Then if you are such a fucking PC and Microsoft fanatic yourself, why complain
>at others? Or, was  I wrong again? You're  strictly on  Atari  yourself? Yeah,
>right.... ;-)

refer to above  for the reasons why  i'm using a pc. and mocking makes only you
laugh.

>I say it  again Faramir, you  better step down from your position in Elite, or
>things will get a dramatically change here.....

i don't care  about your  policy of  shouting at  everyone, my  release  was to
denounce  you to  others, you  don't care  about  atari, you  just  care  about
yourself and  about power, you worship satan, you're not the kind guy you faint
to be.

>See you on #atari Faramir! Ohhh, I forgot, you're not wanted there either, and
>you don't have access anymore... 

yes, you made me ban by the bots. how nice of you.

>It's not  the first time you  get banned from there either, you on of the most

if ppl knew what vex's doing, you'd be banned too. but you're not loyal, you're
just a pernicious liar. and a traitor!
