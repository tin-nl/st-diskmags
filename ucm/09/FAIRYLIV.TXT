                                 "FAIRYLIVE!"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

live-album + live-video, produced by Indigo / Strange Ways 1996

Here it  is, the second  live-album from  DE/VISION. After the "Live Moments We
Shared" comes now the album to the "Fairyland?!"-Tour 96/97. Besides  the album
with all the "Fairyland?!"-tracks (except "Dawn") there is also a video with 16
songs and one bonus-"video-clip" and also a view behind the band's tour-life in
this package.
Because I was  on the last concert of this tour (3.5.97 / Kassablanca - Jena) I
can compare the video with the real life-performance.
Ok, on the CD you will find the following tracks:

01. Intro
02. Today's Life
03. Keep Your Dreams Alive
04. I Regret
05. Like The Sun
06. Sweet Life
07. Bleed Me White
08. Harvester
09. Scars
10. Daydreamin'
11. Take Me To The Time

I will not write many things about the songs because you can read my critics in
issue 7 of our magazine. I will only mention that the live-feeling doesn't come
through the speakers. The sound-quality  isn't bad for a live-album (I've heard
some other shitty productions).
Some songs don't sound  like on the  original-album and at first  you must hear
very exactly to define the single songs.
Another point I don't like is that there are  no specials on the CD, because it
would be much better if some other songs like their german "Endlose Tr„ume" (it
was only released on Maxi-CD) would be included... 

On the video you will find:

01. Intro
02. Today's Life
03. Get Over The Wall
04. Keep Your Dreams Alive
05. I Regret
06. Sweet Life
07. Bleed Me White
08. Harvester
09. Dinner Without Grace
10. Daydreamin'
11. Take Me To The Time
12. Blue Moon
13. Your Hands On My Skin
14. Moments We Shared
15. Try To Forget
16. Outro

17. Videoclip "I Regret"

Hum... the video shows shootings from their tour in '96 in Cottbus, Potsdam and
Hannover. Here are also some (but only a few =( of their  older songs included,
but I missed "Dress Me When I Bleed" and "Sea Of Flames"...)
But it gives you a good  impression of the live-performance. Ok, I've seen some
better  live-shows (but  you can't  demand to be branded on every concert... if
you  don't know  what I mean I will  give you a word... Rammstein =)... but the
whole performance  matches to  the melancholic  synthie-pop. So you have a very
trist  stage-outfit and  only two  keyboards  on the  stage. The whole show  is
based on light-effects, and these are real nice ones. The other shows-effect is
the  dance-performance  of the  singer, but some  guys had said he looks like a
little copy of Dave (Gahan) in former years... =)
Another  thing I don't  like are  the constant  requests "Wo sind Eure H„nde" - 
"were are your hands" of the singer... huuu... I've  heard this  about 20 times
in the  concert and  so also here  you can hear it about 10 times... I think if
the guys in front  of the stage  will like the  show they will applaud and clap
by there own...
The good point of the  concert were the long encores. They've played some songs
I've  never heard before (and I have at least all their long-players) and so it
was really fantastic. And so they have played after the official end-song "Blue
Moon" (text-line "...das Ende ist nah...") about five or six others...
Hum, what should I say? If  you don't  have the "Fairyland?!"-album you can buy
the  live-album. Ok, it  isn't very cheap (like  the old live-package) and cost
about  45 DM, but it's worth  the  money. If you already have the  album so the
only interesting thing is the video... don't know...
I have received it as present for my birthday (thanx Eva, even if I have nearly
nothing heard from you since this time...) and so I don't had any problems with
the price =)...
