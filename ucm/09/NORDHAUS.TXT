                                    AND ONE
                                 "NORDHAUSEN"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

album, released by Virgin 1997

At last, here is it, the  fifth and  long awaited album of AND ONE, the leading
german electronic-band. After their dispute with the old label MODERN MUSIC and
a forced  break of about  three years they're now under the major-label VIRGIN,
but  this is  the  only change. Their  music  is the  same as  before, cool and
sometimes a little bit trashy electro-pop.

contents of the album

This  album contains  the same  mixture as  the older ones, you  have the usual
dance-floor-fillers, some  slow  things  and  potential  club-hits, and  not to
forget again ambiguous lyrics.
Some  guys don't  like the  cover-version  of Harpo's "MOVIE STAR" or  the song
"SWEETY SWEETY". I don't know why. I think you should not write only songs with
deeper meaning and why they should break with their faible for trash-songs?
These two songs  are good for jumping around on the dance-floor and is this not
the main thing?
I for myself like the whole album, even if it is again a bit short (45 min) and
I think it's the  best AND ONE album  so far and we could see some of the songs
in the charts and this isn't a bad thing.
I will not write more bullshit here. If you like electro-pop just go and buy it
it's really worth the money!

SOMETIMES

daddy said that I'm a good boy
cause I always did his will
but I can't remember
was it me
how did I feel

I call'em family
but in the heart of hearts I know
there's something wrong with me
what can I do?

mother said that I'm a good girl
I was always dressed to kill
but I can't remember
was it me
how did I feel?

now this is long ago
but today I'm really sure
I don't wanna crawl no more
no I don't want to

I want to be all alone
(to be all alone)
(leave me all alone)
(I'm so lonley)
sometimes I dont't know what I prefer to be
(that's all that I can see)

so I burnt down the house of hate
the key to close the door
what a nice september
I found out it's not too late

it happened yesterday
but today I'm really sure
I don't wanna crawl no more
no I don't want to

I want to be ...

MOVIE STAR

you feel like Steve McQueen when you're driving in your car
and you think you look like James Bond when you smokin' your cigar

it's so bizarre
you think your are a new kind of James Dean
but the only thing I've ever seen of you
was a commercial spot on the screen

Movie Star, oh Movie Star
you think you are a Movie ...
Movie Star, oh Movie Star
you think you are a Movie ...
Star ...

you should belong to the Jet Set
fly your own private Lear jet
but you worked in the grocery store every day
until you could afford to get away

so you went to Sweden to meet Ingmar Bergman
he wasn't there or he just didn't care
I think it's time for you my friend
just stop pretending that you are a ...

Movie Star ...

frozen hero
your works are zero
and your dreams are vanished into dark
long ago

Movie Star ...

UNS GEHT'S GUT

sie schicken uns hoch
(Befehl)
bringt uns Sterne
doch niemand ahnt
wir schweben gerne

Instrumente versagen
(kann sein)
am Heck die Glut
(Oohh,oohh)
doch niemand ahnt 
doch niemand ahnt

uns geht's gut
wirklich gut
uns geht's gut ..... gut !

keine Sehnsucht
(Warum?)
nach Mutter Erde
behind the moon
verglÅhen wir gerne

uns geht's gut ...

MY WARRIOR

he said it only takes a year
one thousand storys
(depression comes
depression goes he said)

why don't you open up your eyes
my head is burning
(emotion comes
emotion goes he said)
(my Warrior)

he promised sun
he send the rain
wake up I'm falling
(illusion comes
illusion goes he said)
(my Warrior)

why don't you open up your eyes
why don't you leave me when I'm falling
(my Warrior)
why don't you open up your eyes
why don't you see my head is burning
(my Warrior)

he use to be my Warroir these days
covering in glory
(a dreamer comes
a dreamer goes he said)
(my Warrior)

should I lie, should I cry, should I fly or die
I think it's time to stop pretending pain
(the winner comes
the winner comes my friend)
(my Warrior)

why don't you ...

CREATURES

we're back to Creature
very hard to understand
I can't imagine how it happened
impossible to comprehend

I feel the danger
what are things coming to
they shut their eyes go into hiding
there's no god for me and you

why are we Creatures
it's our natural way
why are we Creatures
I hear it day by day

I call you Creature
and I'm not behind the times
do please forgive me
I'm a rebel
I hit you right between the eyes

why are we Creatures
it's our natural way
(it's our natural way)
why are we Creatures
I hear it day by day
(I hear it day by day)
why are we Creatures
that's what I hear you say
(that's what I hear you say)
why are we Creatures
I hear it day by day
(I hear it day by day)

with all my power
against the wall of decadence
you'll shut your eyes go into hiding
time to have some influence

why are we ...

SWEETY SWEETY

she came from the U-Bahn right now auf mich zu
mein Herz wurde faster denn the reason warst nur you

why don't you open your mind
hîr mir zu !
I know es klingt crazy but I only want a Kind from you

Sweety Sweety marry me
hunderttausend kids for me
chances will passing by
my dear

don't take it mir Åbel when I let you keine ruh'
I don't want to drÑngel you but I only want a Kind from you

Sweety Sweety ...

SITATA TIRULALA

geh' mir aus dem Weg
und nimm die Steine mit
vor meinem Ziel lagen sie verkehrt
sieh' mir ins Gesicht
vergiss die Augen nicht
spÅrst du wie mein Blut sich vermehrt?
wenn du diesen Fehler machst
mir in die Fresse lachst
dann fÑllt es mir nicht mal so schwer
ich wÅrde zÑhlen bis zur drei
dann gÑb's 'ne riesen Schweinerei
denn Diplomat bin ich schon lang' nicht mehr

eins
zwo
drei
vorbei
Sitata Tirulala!

eins
zwo
drei
vorbei
einer geht noch rein

die Warscheinlichkeit
das du dich kannst erinnern
sie wirkt auf mich ein biûchen schwach
drum schleif' ich dich zum "Walterbach"
verzeih' mir wenn ich lach'
ich leg' dich flach

eins
zwo
drei
vorbei ...

FRIENDS IN HEAVEN

it's like it seems
someday
holy hands and holy talks
they'll creep
so I understand

that hypnotize tonight
hit and miss
like fragile lies
they'll creep
so I understand

strange and clean
I had the information of misery
in times of change I've seen
Friends in heaven

that hypnotize tonight
hit and miss
like fragile lies
in me
so I understand

strange and clean ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MIRROR IN YOUR HEART

the party's going on
you cry when they gone
cause invitations are lying when music is dying
(quietly)

you're counting the years
(you're counting the years)
you're counting the days
cause the rage of the butys is stronger than dutys
(can't you see ?)

it's only human that you cry
it's only human that you catch the lies
touch your body
touch the fragile part
but don't break the mirror in your heart

emotional toys come into fashion
when you're down on your knees
they will show the disadventages of passion

it's only human ...

NORDHAUSEN

hier lebt es in mir
lebt es in dir
zwîlftausend KÑstchen leben hier
im Zentrum der Wut geht es ihnen gut
denn diese Stadt ertrÑgt die Not
man nennt es Mut

hier îffnen sie TÅr'n
TÅr'n die verfÅhr'n
zwîlftausend MÑrchen die berÅhr'n
du solltest sie seh'n
um zu versteh'n
denn diese Stadt im Wundertal
lebt Åberall

(Nordhausen Åberall ...)

10th album of them... Haaaarsch... Don't know why and what I had counted, maybe
the singles? Or it was written in a blackout made of alcohol or so one =)
