                     - Interview with Dodger of Therapy -
                              by Grey of Shadows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                              

-> Hi Dodger!

-  Heya! :-)

-> The firST of  all please tell me something about  yourself (a real name, age
   etc)

-  My real name is Olaf Piesche, I'm  aged 23. Actually I come  from Nuremburg,
   southern part of germany, one year ago I moved to Mettmann in the north, for
   reasons of school.

-> What was a main reason why you bought a Falcon?

-  Well, the main reason was that  I wanted to code  something on it - and this
   is a little bit  funny, because at this time  I did not  have the  slightest
   idea of  coding, except  GFA-Basic - and, that  it was  so colorful  and the
   games looked so good... 

-> Do you had other computers before? If yes, so what you did on these?

-  My "computer career" started with a Siemens PG670 my dad took home from work
   one day. That  was a huge  thing, weighing  70 kilos and running under CP/M.
   That was when I started to code my first BASIC lines...
   Then, three or  four years later, I got a Commodre 16, on which I started to
   code several  tiny programs  in Basic, and  that was  when I first heard the
   word "assembler". There  were a few tries to  code a game on it, but nothing
   that was ever finished.

-> You are a member of a well known  group on the  Falcon, called Therapy. What
   do you want to do in the near future ? You are a demo group only?

-  Well, we started  as a demo group, but we have some serious projects running
   under our label "Therapy Seriouz Software". The first is a hispeed  graphics
   file converter  and image  processing  software  called SMURF. We want to do
   some  other seriouz  projects (we're  thinking  about  a HTML-Editor  and an
   alternative  desktop, but this is  not clear yet). Apart of that, we will of
   course continue  making demos  and, if the  routines we're working at at the
   moment, are getting as good as we think, a game for Falcon.

-> Please tell me  Dodger, what do  you think about a Falcon scene? What do you
   want to see more on the Falcon ?

-  I think, the  Falcon scene  is simply  great. There  definitely is  no other
   scene, in  which the  members stick  together  so tight. You  know, even  on
   competitions, there  is no "no, you can't  see it, it's  my routine" like on
   other computers. We've seen that kind of people on the Symposium 96, and  it
   just sucks. When  we meet at conventions, we're just glad to meet again and,
   well, It's like a "merry go-round" ;-))

-> Which groups and demos in your opinion are the beST on the Falcon?

-  The best group... hm, let me think  about it... on ST I think  it's The Lost
   Boys and Synergy. Both  have done  the best demos on the  ST I've ever seen,
   and I can't say who is better... the  best demos are  IMO "Froggies over the
   fence" and "Oh, crikey, what a scorcher!"
   But in my ST times I have  not been  so deep  in the demo  scene, so I don't
   really know anyone.
   On Falcon I believe it's AVENA and LAZER, who both do unbelievable things on
   this  machine. The  best  falcon  demos  ever... I'd  say "Lost  Blubb"  and
   "Sonolumineszenz".

-> What do  you think about  PC and demo  scene on this machine? Do you want to
   buy it?

-  I don't plan  to buy a PC in  the nearer future. If I ever change system, It
   will be a Mac, but this  is nothing to  plan yet. But I  will never  sell my
   Falcon, this  is something I can securely say, because coding and working on
   it is just too much fun!
   The PC scene, well... some people in it seem to think they are the greatest,
   but not  all of them are  like that. I  think it's not easy to say something
   about this whole scene, rather than about certain people/groups.

-> What do you think  about future of Atari scene? Some people say that "we are
   dying". Do you agree with it?

-  It may seem like that, but I think  we also have  newcomers (actually we are
   newcomers, too...;-). And  the scene keeps  itself alive. It's just too much
   fun for all the people.

-> Now we  have a new  Falcon clone, called  PHENIX. Many  people say that this
   machine  is "a real dream" for  Atari users. What's  your opinion about this
   machine?

-  If it is  going to be  released (which I  really do  hope!) it  will be. The
   hardware is pretty  good, you have a fast 040/060 CPU and this awesome 80MHz
   DSP56301... I think It's going to be a great machine.

-> How do you see a future for this project? It's possible to do a new scene on
   this cool machine?     

-  I think it is. If Centek does a clever marketing (which I believe, after all
   they told us) it will be a machine that would even be able to break into the
   Home PC market again, at least a little. Centek has worked out a really good
   concept  for the  machine. And  for demos  it'll  be the  ultimate  machine.
   Imagine, a DSP of that speed with direct acess to the normal system RAM. 8-)

-> What do you  think about Atari  market? Many people said that Atari machines
   were ever the best, but the market was CRAP and it's a main reason why Atari
   had problems. What's your opinion about it?

-  I think It's mainly  ATARIs fault. They did  really have the  best machines,
   hardware that  was one to  two years ahead  of all the others, but they just
   had the  worst marketing the  world has ever  seen. If they'd done this part
   better, we could be, where Apple now is, or even better.

-> What is your favourite musical group?

-  At the moment I like most listening to The Prodigy, Underworld, Phil Collins
   and Supertramp.

-> And a book?

-  Douglas Adams' "The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy" and  sequels, and most
   of the Shadowrun series, a real great SciFi-Series!

-> Ok. That's all. Good luck in your work on the Falcon. I hope to see some new
   stuff from you!

-  You will. Looking forward to seeing you on the GIGAFUN 97 or the InterCon!
