                                 BITWA MORSKA
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

produced by : Adam Rogala / Poland
genre       : a so called strategy game
players     : 1 or 2
system      : Atari ST / STE, 512 KB RAM, RGB
status      : freeware?

Here comes another  game from Poland but this time it's for the ST. Again there
is no readme file included but for  this game it isn't essential because all of
you should knew this type of game, at least I think so.
If not, short  some words  about the  game itself. You  and  your opponent must
place 10 ships (ok, in  the game there  are only crosses) on a playfield. After
this you must try to find them by shooting around on this field (it remembers a
bit to Minesweeper). If have hit all of them you've won, no question.
In the original game concept you have different types of  ships. So you have to
place a ship  with 4 fields, 2 with 3 fields  and so on  and so it has more the
touch of a strategy game because you can find a enemie-ship much faster if it's
a big  one. In this  game here you  can place all  your crosses alone and so it
doesn't feature any strategy touch anymore. It's only luck when you hit a ship.
The next  point is, that in the original game you have everytime only one shot,
only if you hit an enemie-ship you can shot  again. In BITWA MORSKA you have at
first ten shots, then nine, eight and  so one. Every  round you miss the enemie
ships you will loose one  shot and especially when  you have only one shot left
and you've missed only one enemie ship it could be boring with the time to find
it on the playfield... Ok, I'll go over to the technics now.
Hum, the  grafix are  very simple  but they serve the purpose. There are little
animations besides the playfields but they aren't outstanding.
There is now sound except some chip-noises for the shots and the hits included.
The game  is mouse-controlled  and you  can play  it against  the computer or a
friend. Against a human  opponent the game could be much more motivating if you
keep up the original rules (except the number of the shots...).
A highscore isn't included but you don't need it really.
Conclusion: a little game for modest people, good for a coffee break or so, not
for playing it the whole night...
