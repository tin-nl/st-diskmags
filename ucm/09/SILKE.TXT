                                 SILKE BISCHOFF
                           "THIS IS THE NEW RELIGION"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

produced by INRI-records / AM Music 1991

Don't know  if this was the  first SILKE BISCHOFF-album because  nearly all the
songs are also on the album "SILKE BISCHOFF" and  some others are also included
on the album "THE MAN ON THE WODDEN CROSS"... Hum, don't know.
As you cant read in the older issues of UCM this band is  performing electronic
wave. In the  early days they were much crasser as today and  their songs could
bring some guys with suicidal tendencies to the final flash. The electronic
music is a bit more experimental on  this album and  not as harmonic  as on the
later  albums like "TO PROTECT AND TO SERVE" or "NORTHERN LIGHTS". But  as I've
said above the lyrics are very evil! Just read them!

At first what you can find on this album?

01. I Don't Love You Anymore - You'll Die
02. Small And Tired
03. 666 Hellbound - The Devil's Within You
04. Hold Me
05. Follow Me Into The Night
06. Why Me?
07. The Church-Bells And The Razor-Blades
08. On The Other Side - I'll See You Again
09. I Don't Love You Anymore - You'll Die (acoustic)
10. Why me? (acoustic)
11. Small And Tired (acoustic)

Hum, what  should I  say. There are  only a few songs  for dancing to, like the
club-hit "ON THE OTHER SIDE - I`LL SEE YOU AGAIN". The  others  are  mostly  to
slow and  so you can  hear them only at  home but  be carefull! If  you're very
depressive  or melancholic  the music can  make you feel much sicker as you can
think! Even when  you're not in a bad state the  most songs are  effecting very
threatening! This  comes not  only of the  very crass  sounds  and samples (the
usual church-bells and  imitated machine-guns and  so one...) but also from the
very dark voice  of the singer. In  the later albums he doesn't use such a dark
voice anymore. Today the  music of SILKE BISCHOFF is  much more melodic and his
voice is much softer...
But today their music has the same contents, love and death. About the last one
they don't  sing too obvious but at  the "NEW RELIGION" you can hear  in nearly
all texts something about the death. And so you can listen to german whispering
voice which tells  you to  cut yourself  with a  razorblade or  just speaks the
"Lord's Prayer"... And even  for me this music is suitable to become a very bad
feeling and I really know, how I must handle with such kind of depressive music
and so you should be very careful by listening to this stuff... Believe me!

I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE

Waiting on the telephone
I can't leave the room
Maybe you call me when I'm through the door
All these hopeless hours staring at the wall
I can't move my body
I can't sleep

The sky is dark and noisy voices in my head
They tell me that I'm free again now
No more chains
Free again

Hey Hey Hey I don't love you anymore
I look into the mirror
A strangers watching me
Trembling his lips
a cold shining in his eyes

The cage of my broken body
Only one way to escape
A screaming nightmare
I dream in red

The sky is dark and noisy voices in my head
They tell me that I'm free again now
No more chains
Free again

Tîte sie! Tîte sie! Tîte sie!

I see your face in the crowd
Now it's time to sleep
I see fear and loathing in your eyes
Why don't you touch me babe?
This is the end
Come and feel the cold knive in my hand
Hey Hey Hey

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMALL AND TIRED

It was a colored, dark, fast year
Too many changes, to many accidents
I've seen the rainbow in your eyes
A long cold winter, I'm so lonely inside

Sometimes I'm the number one in town
Sometimes I'm just a terrible clown
Sometimes I'm a beautiful young god
Sometimes I'm only small and tired

It was a colored, dark, fast year
Too many changes, too many accidents
The future days are lost in the past
I'm on the road again between night and day

Sometimes I'm the number one in town
Sometimes I'm just a terrible clown
Sometimes I'm a beautiful young god
Sometimes I'm only small and tired

Small and tired
Small and tired
Small and tired
Small and tired

Sometimes I'm the number one in town
Sometimes I'm just a terrible clown
Sometimes I'm a beautiful young god
Sometimes I'm only small and tired

Small and tired

666 HELLBOUND (The devil's within you)

You're imprisoned in an endless labyrinth
You don't know how to get out
Your mind is flaring like a candlelight
In a hall with a hundred doors
It's a puzzle, you have to arrange the pieces
Nothing can stop this game

The devil's not outside of you
The devil's within you

You're imprisoned in your disgusting dreams
Touched by the creatures of the dark
Your flesh is rotten, you've lost your soul
There is no hope for redemption
Read the words written with your blood
No remission of your sins

The devil's not outside of you
The devil's within you

The devil's within you!

The devil:

.... ...... ....

Help me! I'm in hell!

KYRIE ELEISON

The devil:

Let me see your body bleed
Let me taste your flesh
Take the cross between your legs
And you'll be a living dead

Let me hear your mortal shout
Let me drink your blood
I'm gonna fuck you in your arse
And you'll be part of me

Vater unser
Der Du bist im Himmel
Geheiligt werde Dein Name
Dein Reich komme
Dein Wille geschehe
Wie im Himmel
So auch auf Erden
Unser tÑglich Brot gib uns heute
Und vergib uns unsere Schuld
wie auch wir vergeben unseren Schuldigern
Und fÅhre uns nicht in Versuchung
Sondern erlîse uns
Von dem Bîsen

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOLD ME

A lot of trouble the whole night through
A lot of tears for me and you
We fight like mad dogs
You throw glasses on the wall
I say words I shouldn't say
And you run away
A few days later you're on the phone
You spent the nights with a friend of mine
And you're yearning for me
"It's too late, you've made your choice"
I say with tears in my eyes
So don't call me again

Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

When I'm coming home at night
An ambulance is in the street
I'm going up the stairs
The door is open, you're on the floor
A man is coming up to me
Saying "Too late she took an overdose"
I run to you, I kiss your face
I look into your broken eyes
And you whisper in my ear

Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

And I hold you in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
I hold you in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
And you die in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
I hold you in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
And you die in my arms
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOLLOW ME INTO THE NIGHT

Let me take you by your hand
I feel the darkness in your heart
I'll lead you to another land
It's just a different point of view
Close your eyes and come with me girl

Follow me
Into the night
Into the night

Let me kiss you hard my love
Nothing will tear us apart
I'll protect you in your dreams
I'll be with you in your dreams
I'll be with you, when you scream
Stay with me, don't be afraid

Follow me
Into the night
Into the night

Ho Ho-Hey Ho Ho-Hey Ho...

Follow me, follow me
Into the night
Follow me, follow me
Into the night
Follow me, follow me
Into the night
Follow me, follow me
Into the night

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY ME?

It's your last journey in this world
It's dark and cold, you'll never return
They take some pictures of the panic in your eyes
No time to sleep for the rest of your life

The loser's party is out of control
Raging madness in his eyes
You feel the cold metal of his gun
No way out, no way to run

Why does it have to be me?
Warum gerade ich?
Why me?
Why does it have to be me?
Warum gerade ich?
Why me?
..............

WHY?

A broken windscreen
And you're dead

Why does it have to be me?
Warum gerade ich?
Why me?
Why does it have to be me?
Warum gerade ich?
Why me?

WHY ME?

THE CHRUCH-BELLS AND THE RAZORBLADES

A rainy day, she's alone in her room
Drowned by the pale light of the moon
She's staring at the scars on her wrist
Where do I come from and where will I go?
Is there anything on the other side?
She closes the curtain and turns off the light

Schimmernde Rasierklingen
FlÅstern ihr
Verlockende Dinge zu
Sie wispern
Sieh nur,
Wie schîn wir funkeln
Wir ritzen Deine Haut
Ohne daû Du etwas davon spÅrst
Wir lieben Dich!
Komm mit uns!

She watches herself in a clouded mirror
She hopes it won't hurt too much
Everything seems to be so sharp and clear
Is this life or just a dream?
An intermediate station on the way to eternity
The waters warm and cosy her skin

KÅhle Kacheln glÑnzen dunkel
Im trÅben Licht der Lampe
Die Rasierklingen sind ganz nah
Du bist so sÅû
Unter Deinen schwarzen HaarstrÑhnen
Hervorblickend
Hab keine Angst
Wenn Du Dich auf die Reise begibst
Wir sind bei Dir
Wir streicheln zÑrtlich Deinen Puls
Wir fÅhren Dich in eine Welt
Ohne TrÑnen
Wir lieben Dich!
Komm mit uns!
Wir lieben Dich!
Kommt jetzt!

And she feels the sound
Of the mighty church-bells
Ignore the deceiving razor-blades
They are slaves of the evil one
Do you really think
Your mission is done in this world?
Your so young
And there are many things you haven't seen yet
Many experiences
You still have not made!
If you leave us now
You'll never come back
There's no return!
No return!

Hey little girl, do you believe in god?
Do you believe in the material world?
Do you believe in anything at all?
Do you believe in everlasting love?
Do you believe in the stars above?
Do you believe in anything at all?

Und das Wasser fÑrbt sich rot

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON THE OTHER SIDE

Do you remember slow motion times
with little golden stars
I see you tumble in the streets
I hold your hand in the cinema
A piece of heaven in a rotten world
You disappeared in a roaring night
I could die, I cry

On the other side, I'll see you again
On the other side, we'll walk hand in hand

I saw you again with tears in your eyes
My heart beats hard
time doesn't move in a picture
But I can't live in the past

Life is easy
if you don't care about the future
and it's easy to smile,
if you don't care about the truth
I still love you but I've changed myself

On the other side, I'll see you again
On the other side, we'll walk hand in hand

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hum .... I think the lyrics  say all... I like  this stuff, even  if some  guys
mean that I have a bad taste...
