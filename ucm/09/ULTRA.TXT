                                 DEPECHE MODE
                                   "ULTRA"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                    

album, produced by Mute Records 1997

Hohoho! At last here it is, the latest album of the gods of the synthie-pop. At
first all have thought  that DEPECHE MODE  will shock the old fans with the new
album, because the first single "BARREL OF A GUN" leaves a split impression and
splitted also the fans. All have  thought the new album will be the hardest and
compromiseless album of them, but it  isn't. It's the clamest album of them and
it contains nearly  soft ballads at all. The fastest songs you  can find on the
first two singles, the rest is  only slow  and very  good music. And  it sounds
like DEPECHE MODE, no question...
At first a short view to the contents:

01. Barrel Of A Gun
02. The Love Thieves
03. Home
04. It's No Good
05. Uselink
06. Useless
07. Sister Of Night
08. Freestate
09. The Bottom Line
10. Insight
11. The Jazz Thieves

Yep, eleven songs  and a playtime of  over a hour, the longest album of them so
far! And they have put all their emotions into the new  songs. The songs give a
view of  the situation of DEPECHE MODE in  the last years. Please  remember, we
had nearly lost this great band. 
Hum, I must  say that I like nearly  all songs on  this album, except "The Jazz
Thieves". I  will not  write anything  about the  single songs. I will only say
that this album is one of the best DEMO-albums up to now (and hopefully not the
last one). I  think we  will receive  more  music  from them, also  in the next
years. And  after the  great "VIOLATOR" album  and  the  strange "S.O.F.A.D" it
seems  that DEMO  are good  enough for  much more  surprises. They have written
history in the music-business and it would be very sad if they would left us...

BARREL OF A GUN

Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come

This twisted, tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb

What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one

A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied

An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside

What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one

Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun

Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
Your holy one

Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun

THE LOVE THIEVES

Oh the tears that you weep
For the poor tortured souls
Who fall at your feet
With their love begging bowls
All the clerks and the tailors
The sharks and the sailors
All good at their trades
But they'll always be failures

Alms for the poor
For the wretched disciples
And the love that they swore
With their hearts on the Bible
Beseeching the honour
To sit at your table
And feast on your holiness
As long as they're able

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

You're holding court
With your lips and your smile
Your body's a halo
Their minds are on trial
Sure as Adam is Eve
Sure as Jonah turned whaler
They're crooked love thieves
And you are their jailor

Love needs its martyrs
Needs its sacrifices
They live for your beauty
And pay for their vices
Love will be the death of
My lonely soul brothers
But their spirit shall live on in
The hearts of all lovers

HOME

You hear the song from the wrong side of town
Where I'm bound to the ground by the loneliest sound
That pounds from within and is pinning me down

You hear the page from the emptiest stage
A (cage) of the heaviest cross ever made
A cage of the deadliest trap ever laid

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home, for singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here

The heat and the sickliest sweet smelling sheets
That cling to the backs of my knees and my feet
Well I'm drowning in time to a desperate beat

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home, for singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong...

Feels like home
I should have known
From my first breath

(It's) the only true friend I call mine
Who pretends that I'll make amends the next time
The friend of the glorious sin of the light

And I thank you for bringing me here
For showing me home, for singing these tears
Finally I've found that I belong here.

IT'S NO GOOD

Gonna take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
The gods decree
You'll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

I'll be fine
I'll be waiting patiently
Till you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realize
Do we have to wait 'till our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You've got to back the (tide)

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

Gonna take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine
It is written in the stars above

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

USELESS

Well it's about time
It's beginning to hurt
Time you made up your mind
Just what is it all worth

All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down

Watch the clock on the wall
Feel the slowing of time
Hear a voice in the hall
Echoing in my mind

All your stupid ideals
Got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground

Here I stand the accused
With your fist in my face
Feeling tired and bruised
With the bitterest taste

All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down

All your stupid ideals
Got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground

SISTER OF NIGHT

Sister of night
When the hunger descends
And your body's a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desire's name

Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill

Oh sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it too

Sister of night
In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
You're desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure

Sister of night
With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself it's alright
You'll make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away

Oh sister, come for me
Embrace me, assure me
Hey sister, I feel it too
Sweet sister, just feel me
I'm trembling, you heal me
Hey sister, I feel it too

FREESTATE

I can hear your soul crying
Listen to your spirit sighing
I can feel your desperation
Emotional deprivation

Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your feelings show

Picking up the conversations
Deep in your imagination
Tune into the lonely voices
Talking of their only choices

Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your spirit grow

Step out of your cage
And onto the stage
It's time to start
Playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state

I can taste the tears falling
The bitterness inside you calling
Yearning for a liberation
Emotional emancipation

Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your senses overflow

Step out of your cage
And onto the stage
It's time to start
Playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state

THE BOTTOM LINE

Like a cat dragged in from the rain
I go straight back out and do it all over again
I'll be back for more

Something that is out of our hands
Something we will never understand
It's a hidden law
The apple falls
Destiny calls
I follow you

Like a pawn on the eternal board
Who's never quite sure what he's moved towards
I walk blindly on

And heaven is in front of me
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
When I arrive it's gone
The river flows
The wise man knows
I follow you

I'm yearning I'm burning
I feel those wheels turning

Like a moth on love's bright light
I will get burned each and every night
I'm dying to
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you

I'm yearning I'm burning
I feel those wheels turning

Like a moth on love's bright light
I will get burned each and every night
I'm dying to
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you

The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you
...

INSIGHT

This is an insight
Into my life
This is a strange flight
I'm taking
My true will
Carries me along

This is a soul dance
Embracing me
This is the first chance
To put things right
Moving on
Guided by the light

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

Wisdom of ages
Rush over me
Heighten my senses
Enlighten me
Lead me on
Eternally

And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns

I'm talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now (You've got to give love)
The world still turns

I'm talking to you now
