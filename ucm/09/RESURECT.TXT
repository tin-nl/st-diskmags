                           The ST Knights present:

              *****  Resurrection Demo - technical file *****


First  of all, if  you want to  make something for  our demo, it will be only a
effect, a part. For  example  a big sprite  routine! (herr... try  to be  a bit 
productive! =)

No crew or coder name should be displayed in the part except if you have made a
new scroll text rout with big mapping and you have to speak about it... 
All will be displayed in the main credits part!

You have  also to tell  us what you want  to do. We don't want 2 people to code
the same thing!

* Machine:
----------

You can make  something only for ST or STe. Falcon  has no place here!!! But if
it runs on Falcon, I will not kick you...

* Memory:
---------

The demo will runs on a drive and also on a hard disk. On dis last support, the
memory  available will be  a bit smaller... So I think that all demo has to use
about 750 Kb  max of memory, video  screens included! My  loader and  the music
will not take more than 50 kb!

* Registers availables:
-----------------------

All the  registers  will be  free! I  think we  won't use  a soundtrack  module
because of the time process required!

* Keyboard:
-----------

No test  of the keyboard: your  part has to  finish itself... and then left the
hand to the demo-OS.

* Interruptions availables:
---------------------------

You can use only timer B! What?!? No vbl? Don't worry: the vbl interrupt can be
used only  for initialization  and doing  little stuff... but with the $4ce vbl
list! Yes has  on the Gem, my demo-OS  will run  your stuff using this way. Big
graphics  routine will be used in the main syncro routine. Don't try to use the
other interrupts, they will be activated by the music of Tao and my demo-OS.

Please insert  BIG COMMENT for the  initialisation of interrupt  in your source
code.

* Tos & Gem variables:
----------------------

Out! No traps or $3xx to $4xx system variables in use...

* Vbl syncro:
-------------

Use a vbl syncro test using the $4ce.w routine. I think nobody will use special
technique  or $4xx vbl  couter or  whatever.... Don't  laught! I've  saw lot of
things since 1990...

* Source code:
--------------

Your demo  has to be  sent in  SOURCE CODE! Yes! I don't  want to spent my time
disassembling  it if any  problem has  occured! Don't  worry, we  won't  spread 
it! ;-)

* Graphics:
-----------

Your effect  can include  some gfx, but  no logo  of your  crew or  you will be
mentioned! If  you  want  to  put  a  logo  it  has  to  be  in  relation  with
"Resurrection" or atARi!!!

* Greetings:
------------

A greetings list could be sent in a txt file. It will only give the name of the
crew you  want to  greet! The  greetings  part is  already coded and only names
could be displayed... But if  you have really  things to tell, we  will code an
end-scroll ...
