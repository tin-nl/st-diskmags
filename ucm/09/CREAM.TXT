                       CREAM SID PLAYER v2.0 STE/Falcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by CREAM / Germany at the SILICONvention 1997

So here it is, the first big  update of the  first (but not only anymore) C-64-
SID-player for STE and Falcon.
This new version replays  the SID-tunes now also on a simple STE without speed-
card with faked 50 KHz.
For the Falcon the update offers also the possibility to replay the sounds with
mono, stereo or surround-effect.
Also the replay-routs were  improved and you can play the  most C-64-sounds now
without bigger problems.
Another good  improvement is the  included file-selector-box (it's  not the one
from the GEM) and you can select the tunes with mouse or keyboard.
Hum, the player contains also the usual functions like trebble, bass & volume.
You can of course select the different  sounds (especially the older stuff from
the games contains more as only one song).
Hum, I think  I must not  loose more words. The player  runs very stable and at
least I haven't seen any bombs or so one up to now.
It runs also on VGA without  any problems. The only  disadventage in comparison
with the FLAYSID-player is that  the prog uses  his own shell. Ok, for the guys
which like special shells and demo-look-a-like screens and don't like GEM-based
stuff it is the right thing, but I think  this could be a reason  for some guys
to prefer the FLAYSID-player, even if this one isn't as good as CREAM's player,
at least this version I had here for the comparison...
Ok, if you want  to replay C-64-SID-musix  on your STE or Falcon you should get
this player. It's freeware and really worth a look...
But at last, let me ask one thing: will we ever get a player for XL/XE-musix on
the STE or Falcon? I think this  would be  also a nice  thing, at least I think
so, because with  the re-discovery  of the XL-scene  in Poland it would be very
interesting  what this  guys are doing  with their  8-bit-machines, esp. in the
sound-area... I think there are also tons of sounds and songs for this machines
around and why not try to make a player for them on our machines?
