Hello and welcome to the first appearance of this new corner in the UCM!

I  think it's  time that  the UCM became his  own coding-corner. I was  long in
negotations with several coders to write some shit for us and now it is reality
and we all hope that you will like the presented stuff.
This corner  is mainly thought  to help the guys  which already can code simple
screens. For bloody beginners this corner isn't very suitable.
You will  not find the  whole sources  to the demo-effects  which are presented
here. So you  already need some  knowledge about coding to use the tips of this
corner.
Hum, the first article by Mike of Stax is written in german and to be honest, I
don't  wanted to  translate  him into english... 30 K, fullfilled  with special
words, are really too much. Sorry.
But if you have any  suggestions or if  you want to read  something about other
effects, if you  need tips or help, just write us! We will give your letters to
the authors and eventually they can give you some help in their next articles.
Another  point: are you interested in writing  some stuff for this corner? Have
you coded a  brainblasting effect and  you want to show how you have done it to
all the others, just get in touch! We need also tips from Falcon-coders!
I think if enough people will show their skills  and release some stuff in this
mag the more guys will try to code the same things. And if  you look around you
surely see that only a few guys are able to code brainblasting stuff.
But the  others surely want  to code the same and with the help of the "guru's"
they have probably the motivation to make better stuff and we get some more and
better releases for ST and Falcon.
After I've seen some demos on the Amiga again and after the brainblasting stuff
on the XL and C-64 it is time to release  better stuff on the ST and Falcon.
This corner  shows that it is possible to  release some of the  effects also on
these machines and it's time to use them in the best way!
So contribute to this corner and with  a little bit of luck we will see also on
the ST brainblasting stuff again...
So go away and code us some cool stuff!
