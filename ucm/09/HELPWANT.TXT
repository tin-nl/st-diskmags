                              WE NEED YOUR HELP!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, even if we have realised this issues, except  some areas, nearly by our own
we need your help to made our magazine much more interesting...

> article-writers wanted!

Even if we had released this magazine with nearly no help from other guys we're
searching once more  for article-writers... You can  write over  all things you
want but  we reserve us  as always if  we will  release articles  with doubtful
contents (like Racism, Nazism or something like that)...
ANOTHER POINT! Because  my ST is damaged  now and I haven't  the money to buy a
new one or  to fix this I can't test ST-software anymore, at least for the next
time. So  we're searching especially  writers which will  test the latest games
and demos for this machine! There's still a need for this! If you want to write
such articles but  you haven't  the latest stuff  you can get it from us, so we
can make a deal and you can profite from this!
Ok, if you're writing some  articles for us you can  send them on paper or disk
to the following addresses:
