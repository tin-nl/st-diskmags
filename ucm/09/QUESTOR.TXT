                      Interview with Questor of Inter
                           (held by mOd/.tSCc.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Hi Questor! After some  truely nice chats at SiliCon, I decided to interview
   you  for UnderCover Magazine. Most  of our  readers know you  because you've
   been one  of the coders  of the outstanding "Obnoxious"-demo. But only a few
   know  private  facts  about  you. It  would  be  great if you could tell the
   readers  how old you are  and what you are doing when you're not coding with 
   your computer.

A: I'm 22 and study informatics at the university in Karlsruhe.

Q: When you  got in touch  with computers  first and which computers were yours
   before the Falcon?

A: I've started  with the  Atari 520 ST! Together  with a  friend I  started to
   "code" in  the Basic. But  after  half a year  I recognized  that the Basic-
   interpreter  wasn't very fast. I tried C, but it wasn't "my" language and so
   I started with assembler. 

Q: Please tell us  more about your way to the demo-scene! When did you start to
   code and when did you join which crew?

A: Samurai and I started  the group INTER in 1989. I had started coding back in
   1987 or 1988 (long time ago :) in assembler and we released  our first intro
   at the Atari-Fair 1991. (a bitmapmania; not very much spreaded...)

Q: Before  SiliCon-party, some  rumours were  spread telling  Inter are dead on
   atARi. At  SiliCon LoST and you  said to continue  working on Falcon. What's
   the truth about Inter's future?

A: Aehmmm.... The truth is that we all have  PCs (they suck!!!) and are working
   more or less only with them. But we both have  still FX for the Falcon which
   where never  released and  never shown. So  we want to release them and quit
   the cool  time on the Falcon. But  Inter will still be on cool  Atari-scene-
   partys, cause they're absolutly the best!!!!!

Q: We've been told  that you are preparing a tank-game for Falcon with graphics
   in "Chaos Engine"-style. Is this true?

A: Yes, but  it's dead. At  the Symposium  I saw a  tank-game  on the Amiga and
   thought: Hey, why  not  convert  it  to  the  Falcon. The  Game  itself  was
   converted  in 2 or 3 days, but I had no Gfx-Man. After half a year I met the
   gfx-man from the dead Amiga-Group ARISE. He made some cool tank-gfx and some
   cool  backgrounds; thats  it... the game  is finished(only needs some little
   enhancements) and some background-gfx are missing... 

Q: The whole scene is waiting for your intro for Animal Mine GSC #66...

A: Ohhhh..... no comment :)  Only one comment: NOT MY FAULT!!!!!!

Q: What are your favourite demos on ST and Falcon?

A: ST: "Froggies over the fence" and "Ooh crickey". But "Flip-o" is cool, too!!
   Falcon: of  course "Obnoxious"; but "EkO  System" and  the  Avena-demos  are
   good, too.

Q: Will the promised InterCon II be held in autumn this year?

A: Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And  it should be much bigger than the InterCon I. But
   the name was changed to InterJam II. Look at the WWW-Pages for more infos.

Q: Let's do a kind of  brainstorming. I'll give  you words  from A to Z and you
   reply them with a short remark!
