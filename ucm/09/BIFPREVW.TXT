                                                                                   
                         BACK IN FRANCE - THE PREVIEW!                             
                         =============================


The  world  famous  crew  NLC (No Limit Coding) hasn't  finished  its  new  GFA
megademo  but ST Survivor send me a preview and I (The Beast/Typhoon) am  going
to test it exclusively for Undercover Magazine!

                                     *****
                                                                                   
The intro                                                                          
---------

At the beginning, a good NLC logo appears (drawn by ST Survivor) by a nice tune
by Lap/Next. A  starfield begins (you'll  note there  are tons of starfields in
this demo) with a text.  The text seems to be quite old (it speaks about TSB, a
dead crew).
After pressing  the space  bar, the loader  is loading (!!!). The loader is the
same than in  the "Froggies over the Fence" (but  in GFA this time) : a big dot
sphere is turning while some text is displayed. Good tune by Jess/OVR.
                                                                                   
The main menu                                                                      
-------------

It looks like  the "Vodka Demo" menu (by Equinox).  The gfx are ripped from the
wonderfull  game "Lethal XCess" and a logo "Back in France" is displayed at the
top of the screen. At the bottom, there's an horizontal scrolltext. The zik was
composed  by Tao/ACF. In the menu, you have to control a little space ship with
the numeric keyboard or the joystick and the screen moves verticaly only.
The  screens  are  symbolised  by  little  brown  things  and you have to press
"Return" or to press the fire button to enter those screens.
But there are 2 problems concerning the main menu:
1. The main menu isn't RAM resident, it loads itself after each demo part...
2. When  you enter  the main  menu, your  previous position wasn't saved so you
   have to drive your space ship until the screen you would like to see.
Note that  in each screen, you  can press "Alternate" in  order to see the time
machine (cool option). Now, I'm going to describe each screen:

1. Starfield                                                                       
------------                                                                       

I must  admit this boring  screen isn't very good. Okay, CTS and Thyrex/NLC can
display 500  dots with  precalculation but  the precalculation is very long and
there is no design...

2. My Pixel Dream                                                                  
-----------------                                                                  

A "Back in France" logo  in 1 plane  is distorting with a starfield. That's a 1
pixel distortion but where is the dezign ?  8-)
                                                                                   
3. Greetings                                                                       
------------

The greetings are  quite old (remember  Thyrex wanted to  release his  demo two
years ago). There is  a starfield  in the bottom of the screen and a scrolltext
in the middle (with a mirror effect). Not very original but quite good however.
                                                                                   
4. Four for one                                                                    
---------------

That's a quite impressive  screen (it's hard  to believe  that's pure  GFA code
isn't it !?). The screen is splitted into 4 parts. The first part consists of a
moving background. In  the  second one, there are vertical rasters and a moving
NLC  logo in  1 plane. In  the  third one, there  is a  starfield and a another
moving NLC  logo (but I think  it's the same as in the 2nd  part). Finally, the
fourth part consists of a picture representing an Atari ST and its monitor, and
there's  a  scrolltext  on  this  monitor.  Well, this  screen  looks  like the
"Flashback" demo by The CareBears!
                                                                                   
5. Meet Your Stars in the Bar                                                      
-----------------------------

That's a  24 hours  screen. The  screen is  splitted into 2 parts. At  the top,
there are pretty vertical rasters. Their lenght is 100 lines with 1 palette per
line (very good!).  At  the bottom of the screens : starfield and scrolltext! A
good screen!
                                                                                   
6. Cool Land                                                                       
------------

As  for me, that's  the  BEST screen  in this  demo! It  consists  of  a raster
scroller  in  overscan...  yeah,  GFA  makes it possible!  You have to move the
rasters with the cursor keys. It's a kind of zoom of a pretty NLC logo drawn by
Flanker during the MegaFun Party 4 (that's oooooooold!).  The scrolling is very
smooth and in 1 VBL. Note this screen was coded in 3 hours only...!
                                                                                   
7. The Big One                                                                     
--------------

This screen doesn't work... Hey, that's just a preview!
                                                                                   
8. Let Them Turn                                                                   
----------------

An  enormous  sphere made  with  380 points is  moving  verticaly... Obviously,
Thyrex is a good coder because he has added an horizontal  scroller and all the
screens only eats 80% of the machine times... Not so good for GFA, eh?
                                                                                   
9. Info Screen                                                                     
--------------

That's probably  the oldest screen of the megademo. It displays information (in
French) about participating to  this demo. There are  just a text, a  music and
some sprites.
                                                                                   
10. Banal Screen 2                                                                 
------------------

A good  screen  too: imagine  a moving  background  with 4 plane sprites... The
music was  composed  by  Big Alec and there is a scroller and the bottom of the
screen.
                                                                                   
11. Flexiscroll                                                                    
---------------

A classic  screen too but  impressive (don't forget it's GFA Basic !). That's a
2 pixel flexiscrolltext with a good muzak by Count Zero.
                                                                                   
12. Bubbles                                                                        
-----------

This screen  is good and  impressive. It looks like a "Flip-O-Demo" part 'coz 4
jelly bubbles (3 big and a little one) are dancing on the screen with  a scroll
text at the top. Cool screen, in fact !
                                                                                   
13. STE only                                                                       
------------

Thyrex wanted  to explore the STE capacities but... this screen is strange! OK,
the soundtrack is played at 25 KHz but where is the blitter stuff??? I just see
monochrom pictures... what's happened? Is this screen bugged?
                                                                                   
14. Hidden Screen!                                                                      
------------------

I don't want  to describe it... I can just  tell you there is a distorter and a
crazy kind of starfield... 8-)
                                                                                   
15. Reset Screen                                                                   
----------------

Two bombs. Obviously, there are bugs... Sh*t !

                                                                                   
The VERDICT!                                                                       
============

Well, I must admit this GFA megademo has goth both excellent and shitty screens
(some of  them are too old). The graphics aren't excellent, there is a lack  of
colors in several screens, some gfx are ripped and there isn't enough design.
Concerning  the musics, that's always the same well-known tunes. But the coding
and technical levels are quite high because the demo was coded in GFA Basic and
that's quite hard to do it.
That's only a  preview and  I hope Thyrex  will erase  all the bugs. I've heard
that ST Survivor has drawn tons of pictures for the demo... good news!

You will  have to  wait  for the  final version, guys, because  I must not (and
don't want) to swap it now. According to NLC members, the demo will be released
in a few months... wait and see !
