                  I saw my neighbours on the news today
              they screamed about some snipers on our block
                  I turned it off,  finished my sixpack
                      and started to reload my M-16

                    This is my rifle,  this is my gun
                   This is my life and this is for fun

                         I am the american dream
                               I am America

                     I keep my town  clean and fresh
                     free from enemies, no more mess
                   I pump the bastards so full of lead
                   that you hardly  can turn them over

Hi Teddy!

Let me first  introduce you  and your group. Well, TMC is maybe the last living
hacking  band in Switzerland. You are also  the Sysop of the  CENTRAL DATA BBS.
This BBS is the  swiss  HQ of ELiTE and  dist. site of VECTRONIX, not to forget
it's TMC WHQ.


First some general questions:


L$R: How old are you?

TEDDY: I'm 23 years old


L$R: How did you start computing?

TEDDY: About 10 years  ago I started  to use a  C64 at school. I soon  bought a
       1040 ST with mono monitor, but wasn't very happy, because most games did
       not work of course. At least I started some coding (GfA-Basic) then...


L$R: What machines do you have?

TEDDY: I have a 1040 STE with fucked DMA, a Falcon030 with 20/40 Mhz and an IBM
       286 which I never use...


L$R: How many members are in TMC? Have you been in other crews before?

TEDDY: Presently  I'm the  only member  in TMC, I have  been in ORION / B.E.S.T
       before, but this crew died unfortunately...


L$R: Why have  you joined  the darkside  of computing  and what  was your first
     hack?

TEDDY: When I bought  a colour-monitor I used to play a lot of games. Because I
       wanted to  get all new  releases, I started  to trade. The crackers were
       "gods" for  me in those  times, and  I wanted to  be like  them. I can't
       exactly  remember  my first  hack, I think it was a lame painting proggy
       with password check, can't remember it's name.


L$R: What was the hardest programm (game or utility) you have ever done?

TEDDY: The best  protected  piece  of software  must  have  been a  game called
       "War Heli", which  was only  cracked 3 years  after release! (Not by me,
       unfortunately...) These  days you  won't find a really  good protection.
       Coma was pretty hard to do, I only managed to make the voice patch...


L$R: How's the  scene in Switzerland  today? I remember guys like CLIMATICS and
     their  BBS 'HANG LOOSE' which  was really cool. Do you know anything about
     them or other swiss crews?
     
TEDDY: Well, the  scene is  totally dead. Bandit and his "Hang Loose" have left
       silently  quite a long  time ago. I  think he  is on Mac nowadays, but I
       never again  heard anything  from him. I  still know some cool guys like
       Spiff & Spike / Orion Xilef & Dr.Diddle / Bytechangers. Even some of the
       old TDA  should be  alive, and  I just  got a  mail from  Spiff they are
       planning to make a midi-maze convention, as we did in the past. But none
       of them is active on Atari anymore...


L$R: How many callers does your BBS have? Is there many activity? 

TEDDY: There is VERY low activity, especially now in summer. In fact I only run
       the BBS for  test purpose of my BBS software. The users don't seem to be
       interested in new stuff at all (?!?!)
       BTW, don't call the actual number, it will change dis month.
       So if you want to get the new number, contact me on IRC #atari or ask in
       an Elite/Vex BBS...
       Swapping gets more and more popular using ftp... Internet rulez!
       
       
L$R: Are there any future projects planned?

TEDDY: Continue some  work on Hell's BBS, maybe  include telnet connections and
       ftp-server, as  soon as there  is PPP-Sting... Even a new version of the
       "Ultimate Shareware Hacker" could be released if I get some new stuff to
       work on...


L$R: Why don't you join another crew?

TEDDY: TMC exists for quite a while now, I want to lead it till the end... If I
       see trouble which Elite had lately, I'm just happy I never joined them..


L$R: What interests do you have apart from computing?

TEDDY: I like to  drink beer with some friends, watch a good movie... I used to
       play the  piano, but  don't have  any since I moved out from my parent's
       place. And  of  course: Stefanie! She's  so  sweet... (Not  the one from
       Monaco!!)


Please give a short comment on following topics:

ATARI         - When Atari died, also a part of myself died...

FALCON        - Didn't  have the "power without the price" which  was needed to
                make it a success...

AMIGA         - Seems still to be very alive, they still have good coders!

PC & MS       - PCs are ok  to run  linux, Microsoft is some sort of religion I
                don't believe in...

DEMOS         - Have been  something  very cool  on th ST... Are  pretty boring
                nowadays... Always the same 3D stuff...*YAWN*

SCENE         - It's dead, at least the real one...

CRACKING      - Like a drug...

INTERNET      - I use it every day, hope to afford a leased line one day... Big
                chance to keep Atari alive...

JAGUAR        - Was great  when it came  out, but licensing-system by Atari was
                so stupid...  I would buy a Playstation now.

PLAYSTATION   - It's cool, good power for price value.

NINTENDO 64   - Don't know it very well.

VECTRONIX     - Still alive thanx to ph0enix... Sell your PC, man! ;)

ELITE         - Had big trouble with Faramir. Thanx to Orby it maybe will still
                be alive for a while...

SLAGGING WARS - Any war sux(!)

DISKMAGS      - Most paper-mags  have died, so  it's great  still to get good &
                cheap news thanx to diskmags like yours!


L$R: Allright. That was all. Have you any last words for the public?
