You surely remember the game "Alien Thing", the first  commercial appearance of
this  english software-company. Ok, this  one was released  under the label TOP
BYTE, but now they're back with the first release under their own label-name.
It's a low-budget-production and in comparison with their old game a bit simple
and I think no one needs another Mine-Sweeper-clone today.
But they've released  one and so we must  test it. I will  not leave any  words
about the game itself because all of you should know the game-princip.
As usual you must find the mines on the playfield and mark them in time. But in
this game you can also  find bonus-things  like extra-life and time-stops (this
because a clock is running while playing the game and you must try to finish it
as fast as you can).
It features  three different game-modes but  in this preview  you can only play
the easiest mode, the others are disabled.
The technics  of the game are ok for a low-budget-production. The game features
some nice  drawn grafix  and  little animations (except  the  menu  which looks
extremly simple) and also sampled soundeffects in the game. Not as good is that
there are no musix in the menu or highscore-table. At least a little chip-music
would be a nice thing, but here you have only the silence of a graveyard...
The control  with the mouse is ok and the game  features also a highscore-table
and so the motivation is saved for some minutes.
The problem of this  game is that it's  too old-fashioned. No one needs a Mine-
Sweeper-clone again. There are tons of this  games around, also  in the PD, and
after such a nice game like "Alien Thing" I don't know why the makers have done
such a big step backwards. Ok, Mine-Sweeper-addicts will surely like this game,
especially  if they only own  a simple ST because for this machine the technics
and the presentation aren't too bad, but I don't think that there are many guys
out there which spend their time with playing Mine-Sweeper all the day...
