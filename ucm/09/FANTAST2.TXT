As I had  received this  thing I was very interested  in it because  there were
only a few freeware adventure-games on the Atari and they're mostly shit.
Ok, after depacking  I started the  game and, hum. The intro-sequence  offers a
simple  picture with a  simple music... and  so is also  the game. It's  a very
stupid one. You  have to run  around with  your hero  and to kill  monsters, to
talk with different persons which you will find in the houses and villages.
Some of them can give you interesting informations and others are talking total
bullshit. There are some shops around, but you can only buy hitpoints, with the
gold you have received for every killed monster.
Your job  is it to  find the Black Knight  which has  created all the creatures
around and who  terrorises the little  country. And so you have  to walk around
and to kill tons of monthers like snowmans (erm...), skulls, skeletons, wolfes,
spiders, bats, ghosts and others...
Hum. Ok, at first it sounds really like a little adventure for the coffee-break
but it is too simple. The grafix are extremely  childish and sometimes it looks
a bit  like very  old japanese  adventure-games. The  sprites are mostly simple
animated but they've not  a little bit intelligence. They're only sprites which
moving  around on the  screen in simple routes. They will  never attack you and
the  only way to be killed is to contact  them too  often. But you have a sword
and so you must  search for a  place where you can stand and hit the monster if
it's going by. Everytime you will come to the  next screen the  monsters in the
old screen will apear again and so it's much more work to go ahead. If you have
only a ST / STE the  speed of  the game  slows down  if there are more as three
sprites on the screen...
There is now music  in the  game itself, only the intro and the end screen have
a little chip-music. In the game there are also no FX... don't know why.
The control with the stick is ok but you can only walk horizontal and vertical.
What should I say? This game is as fantastic as a stone bumping on your head.
Only for masochists... but it's free, this is the only positive aspect...
