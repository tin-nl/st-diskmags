                      Interview with Vat of LuZak Team
                            (held by mOd/.tSCc.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                            

Q: Hello Vat! In  the recent times  the atARi-demo-scene was provided with lots
   of  cool  productions  from  Poland.  Unfortunately,  there  are  nearly  no
   information  about your scene in the western countries. So I'm very proud to
   have  you as  an  interview-partner! Firstly, most  of our  readers  may  be
   interested in your real-life activities. How old are you? Where do you live?
   What  are  you doing  when not  sitting before  your computer? What are your 
   hobbies?

A: I'm 24... I live in Warsaw / Poland / Eastern Europe, but I study in  Poznan
   [300km away from my home]. What  to say  about my city... I don't think that
   there is anything special in Warsaw, it's a city like other cities [for sure
   not like Poznan!]... and for sure the only one in Poland, where I'd  like to
   spend rest of my time... ;)
   Heh... hard  question... maybe  I'm at univ then, or just sleeping... ;)  to
   tell the truth... I spend almost 99% of my live at the  front of my compi...
   hobbies... hehe.. there is only one hobby: having phun! ;)


Q: When you got  in touch with  computers first  and which computers were yours
   before the Falcon?

A: I think it  was in  1984... my cousin  was in States where he was given with
   ZX81... after few months of playing  he was bored with it, so he  gave it to
   me... next  machine was ZX Spectrum 48k... In 1986 my father bought me Atari
   65XE with tape recorder [after few months I got floppy disk drive]...
   Computers &  hardware  was f**n' expensive these times... to imagine how far
   it was, you  should know that  usually month  salary in Poland was about $15
   up to $20 USD... After 65XE, I used  several platforms as: Amstrad CPC 6128,
   Commodore 64 and PC AT clone... from 1991 I got  my dreamed Atari 1040STE...
   and from thiz machine my real fun with computers began... ;)
   the only one  machine I've never  played with is Amiga... :(   maybe someone
   will send me one???  ;)


Q: Please tell us more about your way to the  demo-scene! When did you start to
   code and when did you join which crew?

A: So, we have to back into 1988 when my  friend bought  Atari 520STFM+SF314 :)
   In these  times in Poland  copying of music/video/computer programs _WASN'T_
   illegal!!! [Can you  believe  this? - untill 1994 if I remember right].  So,
   each  weekend [Saturday  &  Sunday] in  Warsaw  there  was [and  still  are]
   organized  kinda multi-computer "party" on Grzybowska str.  Few ppl on those
   meetings showed their abilities in coding  and rest [almost 95%] who  had an
   access to the newest warez, were selling it to visitors [everyone who wanted
   new stuff]... Of course as almost everyone, I had my part in thiz "event"...
   On thiz "bazaar" I  met Peter/Quant [a  gfx-man of  1st Polish cracking/demo
   crew on ST]...  So, when I saw  their productions I  told myself, why not to
   start  learn programming... and I started with GFA Basic, but... some things
   in thiz language were so hard to understand [at least for me]... and that is
   how I started to learn asm... mostly  by myself, becoz Peter  wasn't able to
   answer all of my  questions and I had no contact with coder from Quant... :(
   If I remember right at the begining of 1993 [or maybe it was 1994?] I bought
   14.4k modem, becoz my friend Phoner had free phone access... So, these times
   we were calling to about 90% of scene BBSes [on whole world!] staying online
   for _over_ 16h/day! and  trading between them... It was real life!!! :)  But
   as everything what nice, it finished after two [full of fun] years...
   I formed  LuZak tEaM  myself  and asked  all of  current members to join the
   group... once before thiz I wanted to found a group with ZYP -another polish
   coder [bloody good btw...], but he emigrated to States... :(( and after thiz
   our contacts were very rare...


Q: Some guys who only see the gloomy side of things assure that the atARi-scene
   is dying. What do you think about that?

A: excuse me  for this, but  I won't answer thiz quesiton... I'm so pessimistic
   and my reply probably will be tendentional...


Q: Please, give us a short overview of Poland's atARi-scene!

A: heh... how  to say  thiz...  I'm "back on track" after  about  two  years of
   inactivity... Univ took all my creative strength away, so... but now I think
   that  everything  is  going  right...  I  can't  believe  that  my  lazyness
   disappeared to certain extent [dON't bELivE tO tHiZ.. ;) ]...
   during  these hungry years  I was rather  away from Polish scene so I cannot
   tell  you too much... for sure  lotsa ppl left Atari-scene [ACID TEAM, TFTE,
   TTS, TSV, Zyp,...]... and  few  appeared on, as  SHADOWS & PANDEMONIUM [both
   showed their demos on Falcon demo-compo at SILIconvention'97]...
   What I know about Atari  8-bit scene..? hmmm... I  think it is  quite strong
   and still very active... I think that in Poland are about 8-10 groups... 
   at each  party there  are about  new 5 demo relases! [I wish to see tha same
   on Atari  ST/Falcon  scene]...  Effects  that coders  reached on those small
   machines are  unbelivable!!!!!  For  example:  motion blur, gouraud shading,
   texture mapping, doom like effect, etc...  If you don't  belive, then  check
   out for example:  ASS KICKER demo [relased at Orneta'96 Party in August].


Q: Is it hard  to get new atARi-equipment  in Poland? I think that the hardware
   is much more expensive, right?

A: new Atari equipment? hehehe... there're  NO Atari dedicated shops in Poland!
   ok, maybe  there is  somewhere one  or two  shops, but I've _NEVER_ heard of
   them... So, if  someone  wants  to buy  Atari, then  have to  bring one from 
   Germany  or other  country... [personally  I tried  to get  one  quite cheap
   Falcon for  ModeST [another coder in my  group] unsuccessfully  for over one
   f**n' year!]...
   Hardware isn't that expensive untill you don't mention: Atari, Amiga or Mac


Q: Which  new productions  from LuZak Team  can we wait  for? When will they be
   released?

A: nice question... ;)  Now I'm  about to finish simple BBS advertisement intro
   for ELiTE... Next in  plans is _finishing_ INSOMNIA DEMO [shown at Orneta'96
   Party and! reviewed in Maggie #22 [I wonder from where they had it?]]...
   Also WACHU "?is?" about to finish his PONG like STE game, which features: no
   borders [top & bottom], 50kHz 4ch sound, lotsa sprites at once, etc...
   of course he stopped  developing becoz--> he had not enough money for PC, so
   he sold his  Atari... but if  to beleive his words, he wants his STE back to
   finish the game... so, we'll see... 3rd coder in the group ModeST is working
   on some effects, but I think he needs some support & encourage, so email him
   [modest@venus.amu.edu.pl] with asks: what are you working on, etc... I think
   it should/will help... :)


Q: What are your favourite demos on ST and Falcon?

A: On ST, hmmm... from  those I've  seen and remember: brain damage/AGGRESSION,
   Synergy  demo, flip-o/OXG&DD, dragonnels/ACID TEAM, humeur  vitree/HMD... On
   Falcon  my favourite are: solonum../AVENA, entracte/EXA, eko-system/EKO, and
   so on...

Q: Let's do a  kind of brainstorming. I'll  give you words  from A to Z and you 
   just reply with a few words, okay?

   [nice idea with those from A to Z... ;) ]

   B - bumpmapping : nice effect...
   C - crackers : nut crackers ?
   D - design : all what Atari demos needs...
   E - EKO : pioneers of good demo making on Falcon...
   F - Falcon : nice machine with lotsa bottlenecks...
   G - girlfriend[s] : problems, problems, problems...
   I - Internet/IRC : good for stuff leeching/everyone should try #atari on iRC
   J - Jaguar : We got two JagSERVERs now!, so we'll see what it is worth...

Q: Final  question: what's  your opinion  about  the  UnderCover  magazine? Any
   suggestions?

A: keep it up... don't stop it!!! you're tha  beST for the  moment... but don't
   believe  so much  in your  strength, becoz  you will lost it...  3 to 4 mags
   releases per  year and you're on the top, becoz no one want to read one year
   "fresh" mag...


Q: Now you've got some lines to tell the readers what ever you want! Be certain
