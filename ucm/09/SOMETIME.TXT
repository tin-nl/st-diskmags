                                  "SOMETIMES"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

maxi-single / EP, released by Virgin 1997

Heyho! After 3 years here is a new life-sign of the german kult-electronic-band
with a maxi-EP... Now they're working  under the major-label VIRGIN because the
old label Modern Music has tried to destroy the band. Because of this there was
such a big pause. But now they're back and better as before.

You will find the following songs on this half-hour-EP:

1 - Sometimes (radio-edit)
2 - High
3 - White Doves
4 - Technoman (live-version)
5 - Sometimes (instrumental)
6 - Nordhausen (album-mix)

As you can  see it's not a  simple single. There  are some bonus-tracks included
and  except the  great "TECHNOMAN" they're  all new  ones. And they are all of a
good quality. The only thing which doesn't match to the others is the NORDHAUSEN
song. It's a piano-song, but also very nice... Hm. The best song  for me and the
reason for buying this maxi is the live-version of "TECHNOMAN". I will not loose
any words about this song because you all surely know this track...

SOMETIMES (RADIO EDIT)

Daddy said that I'm a good boy
cause I always did his will
but I can't remember, was it me -
how did I feel.

Now this is long ago,
but today I'm really sure,
I don't want to crawl no more.
No I don't want to.

I want to be all alone,
(to be all alone)
(leave me all alone)
(I'm so lonely)
Sometimes I don't know what I prefer to be,
that's all that I can see.

So I burnt down the house of hate
the key to close the door
what a nice September
I found out it's not too late.

It happened yesterday,
but today I'm really sure,
I don't wanna crawl no more.
no I don't want to.

I want to be all alone,
(to be all alone)
(leave me all alone)
(I'm so lonely)
Sometimes I don't know what I prefer to be,
that's all that I can see.
Sometimes I don't know what I prefer to be,
that's all that I can see.

HIGH

of course you're not afraid of doing
you said to me
touch the face of faith and come alone
I will lead you by the hand
through the heavy sea
take place on my back hold on tight
cause I take a run to fly

(High)
High as the sun we will leave dear old mother
where life has begun
(High)
High as the moon we¥re so glad we decided
to meet our doom

want to strike in leave a crater
like a shooting star
burning with our tails the gods white hair
now wake up from coma to hear what I have to say
take place on my back hold on tight
cause I take a run to fly

High ...

WHITE DOVES

Somewhere in my world
the sun turns blue
some leaders going to
break down their promises

what a sad reflection
we paralized with fear
big man where are you now?
where are you now?

white doves are bleeding
white doves are bleeding

dissimulation
keep watch and ward
you might it for it now if god believes
believes in god

white doves are bleeding

NORDHAUSEN

hier lebt es in mir
lebt es in dir
zwîlftausend KÑstchen leben hier
im Zentrum der Wut geht es ihnen gut
denn diese Stadt ertrÑgt die Not
man nennt es Mut

hier îffnen sie TÅr'n
TÅr'n die verfÅhr'n
zwîlftausend MÑrchen die berÅhr'n
du solltest sie seh'n
um zu versteh'n
denn diese Stadt im Wundertal
lebt Åberall

(Nordhausen Åberall ...)

I think  this single is very  interesting for all who will not buy the album at
first. With this cd they can listen  to the sound  of AND ONE for only 12 DM or
so. Because  there are  also new tracks  included and  of course because of the
great live-version of "TECHNOMAN" this thing is also good for the album-owners!
