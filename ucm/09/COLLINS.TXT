                                 PHIL COLLINS
                            "DANCE INTO THE LIGHT"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------                            

(album)

Due to  the lack  of new "Genesis"-records  and because  the really cool "Dance
Into The Light", I  decided to  buy the  latest  album by  Phil Collins, former
singer and songwriter of rock/pop-dinosaurs "Genesis"...

The CD comes along with a nice designed package featuring  a transparent sleeve
and a stylish orange booklett with all the songtexts and further information.
The  front of  the booklett  shows  us the  grey-haired (if there are any?) Mr. 
Collins  making strange movements with his body. This looks like he's trampling
on a little bug crawling on the carpet, but who cares? ;)

Firstly I  have to tell  you that  I was really  amazed about  the style of the
music. Before listening to it, I thought of these slow heartbreakers he did for
his last album "Both sides" three years ago. But this album contains only a few
of them, the rest are really fast tunes. And that's quite okay.

Hmm, let's start with a detailed review of this CD.

1.) "Dance Into The Light" (4:23)
    I guess  that everyone  of you  know this  song. It was played by the local
    radio-stations for about a thousand times, but it's worth to be a single.
    Great  brass-section. (sounds like "Earth, Wind and Fire", ehh?) The rhythm
    makes you wanna go bounce, doesn't it?

2.) "That's what you said" (4:22)

3.) "Lorenzo" (5:52)
    When I heard  that song first, I thought about a song by Peter Gabriel. Not
    only  the sound is  in Gabriel's  style (kind of  African music), even  the
    voice of Collins sounds like Gabriel's. For all of those who like the music
    of Peter Gabriel this track is a fine piece of music.

4.) "Just Another Story" (6:24)

5.) "Love Police" (4:08)
    This  one will  surely be  another single. Typical  Collins-popsong, really
    commercial outfit, but cool, anyway.

6.) "Wear My Hat" (4:33)
    A truely fast track with funny lyrics.

7.) "It's In Your Eyes" (3:01)

8.) "Oughta Know By Now" (5:27)

9.) "Take Me Down" (3:21)
    Hmm, I  think that  Mr. Collins  made a big mistake when he chose this song
    for the  album. It is nice, no  question. But  it just sounds like the song
    "Wear My Hat" with an other text. Listen to the beginnings of the songs and
    you'll see what I mean!

10.) "The Same Moon" (4:13)
     Originally I  thought that this  would become the second single, but I was
     wrong. But  maybe it  will be  the  third... This  song is  definetely the
     greatest of the album, though it is damn slow. Check out the  cool synthi-
     instrument, which induces a lovely atmosphere.

11.) "River So Wide" (4:55)

12.) "No Matter Who" (4:47)
     This  song was  released as  second  single-track. Not good, not bad. Just
     okay. In  my opinion  there are  some better  tracks for single-release on
     this album. ("The Same Moon")

13.) "The Times They Are A-Changin'" (5:07)
     You surely heard this nice track before, because it was originally written
     by Bob Dylan in  the 60's. Well, I have  to admit that Collins' version of 
     the song  is much  better, not  at last  because of  the great instrument-
     alization. The back-pipes sound cool and the drum really rocks.


Summary: For all kind of people who like the music  of Genesis, Phil Collins or
         just  good pop-music  in style of the 80s, "Dance Into The Light" will
         probably worth listening. I don't regret that I've bought it.
