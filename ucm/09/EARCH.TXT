                      INTERVIEW WITH: EARCHAEOPTERYX
                      ------------------------------
                 (made with the multi UCM interview sheet)


Q: Hi EARchaeopteryx! First  of all  something  about yourself. How old are you
   and what do you do when you're not sitting in front of your computer?

A: I'm 18 years old and doing a boring software engeneering education that will
   hopefully someday transform me into a PC crap developer. It will be a crappy
   job, but at least it's better than examaning someone's feet... (?) ...
   I listen to Front242 and loads of elektro and industrial till I go beserk.


Q: When did you first come into contact with computers, and what was your first
   machine? What sort of computer do you have at  home? What do you enjoy doing
   with your computer apart from programming, music making or painting?

A: ATARI ATARI ATARI!!!! I  got my first Atari 600 XL when I was 10. I now have
   a Falcon030 which I like as much as my old 1040 despite of its slow bus.
   It's the best computer I've ever had, coz it's  enormously  easy to code and
   work on. Appart  from the usefull stuff I like to play  games, read diskmags
   and watch demos. I still use Trip -a- Tron a lot too.


Q: I'd like to know a little  about your background in the scene... how did you
   get  into the demo  scene? What  were the  first demo screens you have taken
   part in?

A: Well, I haven't been round for a very long time. I'm a lone developer/coder.
   My first demoscreen was the Icerain 4k-tro for the SILIconvention.
   
(editors note: He has joined FUN now!)


Q: What about your projects? Is there anything to come in the future?

A: YES! I'm glad you asked that.. I'm going continue making some updates for my
   game Neurobotix and my utility Identifile. I'm  now working  hard on my next
   game. It will be something like Elite II.


Q: ... and how do you view the  large-scale  death of  the Atari demo scene? At
   present it  seems that everything's going down the tubes. Do you think there
   will be a resurrection of the scene, or will it die out slowly?

A: I don't  know if the  scene is  going down  the tubes. It's just the way you
   look at it. I've never known the old German Atari  scene (which was very big
   if I should believe the  hype), so maybe I can't judge properly, but the way
   I look at it is: The  new guys from Poland are cool and I even know some new
   guys  from  Holland. The Senior Dadz  are  amazingly  original  too. There's
   nothing to complain about... You can cry all you want, but it won't help you
   much. I  think some  people (not  really many) are more enthousiastical than
   ever. BTW the maggie team is cool too!


Q: Will you put your Falcon in the corner one day and put a PC on your desk?

A: NEVER! There's  nothing  for me on that  machine. The scene is real crap and
   it's just too normal. The ATARI is too much a  part of me to give up. I love
   every part of it. I'm probably going to buy a Phenix someday  or maybe  even
   an Archimedes to put next to my Falcon.


Q: Right, before everything  gets out of  control here, here are a few subjects
   that you can show your views on with a couple of words or a short paragraph.

ATARI              - Stupid company, cool computers

FALCON             - Atari probably  included a  16-bit bus in the Falcon030 so
                     people  would  upgrade  to the  real 32-bit Falcon040, but
                     they never finished that model.

AMIGA              - Crash!

PC & MICROSOFT     - KIll!!!111!! SAtAnbwWrrRgGGllrRRRrlll!!!!!
                     M3ntAL TorchUUURRRR33EEEEee!!!!!!!
                     I hate  PC-fukkers, coz  most of them laugh at others when
                     they have a slower PC. May this computer scene burn in the
                     eternal fires of hell!!!

DEMOS IN GENERAL   - I've  probably seen to much of 'em. They all seem too much
                     alike. You  can really  see that coders aren't meant to be
                     artists... :( Except  Aura (Ex-illusion) and  S3n10R  DaDz
                     (A1r-D1RT)
                     Ex-illusion is by  far the best  designed  demo I've  seen
                     yet. It's  incredibly  relaxed  and  gives  a  very  weird
                     atmosphere.

DEMO-SCENE         - K3Wl!!

CRACKING           - will  always  exist.  Non-profit  cracking  is  cool,  but
                     commercial  cracks  are  in  my  opinion  very  bad  for a
                     computer scene.

INTERNET           - I love leaching and mailing!

JAGUAR             - Should have  connected  it to a  keyboard, harddrive, etc.
                     and made a real machine out of it!

PLAYSTATION        - Boring T-mapping

NINTENDO 64        - Boring Mip-mapping

"LAMER" & "ELITE"  - I  know  Elite.  Weren't  those   the  fucking  commercial
                     cracking guys? (I hate commercial shit!)

BSE ;-)            - I'm gonna be a vegitarian!

UNDERCOVER :-)     - Cool!! I  like those  nasty (dirty) stories  with loads of
                     grammatical  errors in  them! :) Just kidding. Your mag is
                     cool. You  have the fastest access to the German scene and
                     it's important for people to know what's happening in that
                     particular part of the Atari world.


Q: Apart from computers, what do you like doing in general (hobbies etc)

A: Analyzing FRONT242 music. Frontline assembly! In slaughter  Natives! Insekt!
   DIVE! WILL! Swamp Terrorists! Klinik! Skinny  Puppy! X  marks  the  Pedwalk!
   Suicide Commando! Die Krupps! Laibach! Elektro shit Rul3c!!!! I like some of
   these  bands  for  there  extreme  harsh  or teezing  sounds, but I love the
   atmosphere and elektrodrums in the music too.


Q: What's the one thing you really can't stand?

   PC's!!!!!! K1LLLL !!!1 D3str0Y!!! G0 To H3LLLL!!!!!!!11!! K1ll pC!!! OO00hhh
   F*ck that  stupid bitch GALA is on the radio!!!!! K1ll H3R TO0!!! GrAvEyarD-
   SaTAnBWwrrwgrRlL!!!11!!!


Q: Good, I'd like to leave it there, and if you have a message for our readers,
   do it here...

A: yes I have a usefull message...
