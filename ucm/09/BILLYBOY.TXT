As I've read the title I remembered at first to a condom... erm... but it isn't
one of these strange games which will break up your joysticks and bring wetness
to the keyboard... It's just a little jump'n'run for childs.
You have to run around with your hero (Billy Boy) in various fantasy worlds and
collect yellow stars and as bonus also pink  stars. There are many creatures in
the single levels and you  should not get  in touch with them because they will
suck your life-energy  away. You can jump onto their head and they will go into
the ground for some seconds... they aren't dead and will come back.
You can find several food at the single levels wich will boost your energy. You
can also try to collect ballons with letters on them because if you can collect
all of them you will get some bonus energy for the next level.
That's all, the only thing you have to do is to find the guradian of each level
for leaving the stage. But don't panic, there aren't any boss-stages in here...
The technics of the game are good, but what should I talk you surely know this,
it's a STOSSER game.
The grafix are  nice drawn and colourfull  and there are many animations around
on the screen. Everywhere  you can see some  stuff, like shining gold, blinking
eyes and much more. The  sprites are  also good animated, but  they're a little
bit too small sometimes.
The menu's  and other  screens are  good looking  and in the wellknown STOSSER-
style.
The sound is on the ST only a sampled background music. On the STE you can hear
also sampled effects.
The control with joystick is  ok, only to jump  is a bit difficult, at least it
seems so for the first times.
There is a  highscore-list  included and you  have the ability to load and save
your games, but in the un-registered version they're  disabled. But because the
registration is for free I will give some bonus-points for this at the ratings.
What  should I say. It's  a nice little jump'n'run. Ok, for  the guys which are
hard to please this game is  really to simple, but it's  just a kiddy-game, and
so there is nothing to kill, it's colourfull and nice looking... and I think it
is right for little kids...
