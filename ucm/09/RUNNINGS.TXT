Yoho! Here  it is! RUNNING, in a final playable  version! Mike of STAX had send
me this great production  right after  the release in the middle of April and I
was very impressed! Even if I had seen several previews (the first in autumn96)
I had never thought that the game will reach such a quality!
Hum, what it  RUNNING you will ask me if you have never heard a word about this
game. It's very simple, it's the FIRST Doom/Wolfenstein-clone for the Falcon!
Forget things  like SUBSTATION and other ST-releases, they never reach the same
style... RUNNING brings much more athmosphere and fun to your home, be sure!
In this  shareware-version you can play a full episode of the game and you have
the  job to rescue some  hostages  and searching  for some  dynamite to destroy
nuclear installations.
But this isn't  easy. You must  search the  hostages and  your target in a city
with many  ememies and  traps. So you  must fight against  several soldiers and
guards  and other  baddies like  zombies with a basebat. At first you haven't a
weapon  and you  must kill  the bad guys by kicking them in  their face. In the
game  you will find other weapons, like pistol or shotgun. There are also  many
special-items. So  you can  find  the  usual  medi-kits, shield-bonuses, geiger
counter,  invulnerability  specials, invisibility, maps, motion  tracker, night
viewer and many ohter things like keys and so one.
The game features  also many hidden  rooms and areas (I would say that at least
the  halve of the whole playing-area  are hidden!)...
Another good special is your Laptop. On this you can  read the mission-briefing
and if you connect it  with the terminals  in the game you  will get some hints
and tips for the game.
As you  can see, it features  all the things you know from the typical PC-games
like Wolfenstein, Doom, Duke Nukem 3D and other games...
The technique of  the game is very  good and even on a standard Falcon the game
runs really fast and so you don't need any acceleration-cards. But if you think
it isn't fast  enough you can  chose several screen-modes (details, resolutions
and so one). The grafix aren't bad in the game. The most stuff was rendered and
raytraced  and the enemies  were digitized. Unfortunately  they are very coarse
pixeled and so they're looking all other as nice... but you can blast them away
and this is the main thing! =) In the rooms and areas of the game you will find
also some cupboards, beds and also some trees... And  because the game plays in
more floors you can find stairs and high platforms too.
All other grafix-stuff, in the main-menu and credits are also very professional
looking and freshed up with several demo-effects...
The second point is the sound. In the main-menu you can  hear a fast techno-mod
from Tyan/Stax and in the game itself masses of samples. But not only the shots
and noises from the dying enemies. If you collect some items you will hear some
very cool words like "Don't try this at home!" if you're collecting a pistol or
"No dope - no hope!" if  you find a medi-pack. And if you're  finding no one to
kill you're hero is bored  and you will  hear this words "I'm bored! Let's suck
some blood" or "Let's kick some asses!"... Very funny, he?
And also by the sound you can modify many things  like the volume, frequency of
the replay and surround and stereo output...
The control  with the  keyboard is good. The only thing  is that you  sometimes
standing  in front  of a switch  and you can't  move it or you  can't connect a
terminal with  your laptop, if you're  standing not 100% in front of it... This
isn't very good. But there isn't more to grumble about...
All in  one the game brings  many fun to all the guys which like 3D-shot'em'ups
with many victims. And because there are many secret rooms, a big play-area and
also a comfortable save and load-option included the  game saves the motivation
for very long time, even in this shareware-edition.
The full-version  will bring much more episodes and more items to  use and many
other special things and jokes and I'm very anxious to see and get it soon!
Ok, if you're a guy with killer-instinct and the finger on the trigger get this
game now! There  wasn't another  game of this  genre and in this quality on the
Falcon up to now and buy the final version!
