Finally I have received also this SILICON-demo. It has made the fourth place at
the party and isn't the biggest demo. It seems  that they haven't matched it to
make a bigger demo because the lack of time.
Ok, the demo  starts with a blue  Therapy-logo, which will  be zoomed and faded
out and  you can listen  to another  techno-tune  by 505 of CHECKPOINT. As  you
surely  know his nice  pieces of music you can again listen to  some cool bass-
lines and frequencies... nice, even  if I have  quitted my  techno-history some
times ago...
Ok, after  an "Eggstacy"-logo (hm... all other than  outstanding) you can see a
delay-rotating-zoom  on the  screen. Looks  really  nice. At least I think it's
deleayed, or  I must search for  my glasses or stop to  drink  alcohol together
with painkillers ö) ... anyway it looks really nice.
Then the rotator stops and a load  of little filled  tridi-cubes appears on the
screen, building  some waveforms on the screen. It looks  as they are shaded or
at least light-sourced. They're  to small as I can  recognize this (or I should
really take my glasses ... erm... stop writing bullshit here...).
After a while the rotator starts again, with the little cubes in the foreground
and this looks really amazing.
Then the whole things were faded out, with a little bit of melt-o-vision-effect
and a  plasma  appears on  the screen... Yes, an  ordinary plasma! But  we were
taken  back to the  future with  a very strange  texture-mapped  object turning
around in front of the plasma. Not bad, but also not very special.
After this there are some  gouraud-shaded  objects on the screen. At first only
one  and then  up to  five (huu... all  things  slowed down  when they  are all
displayed on the screen). besides stars and so one there is also a big "T" with
changing colours included. The best  thing follows as  it begins to rain on the
screen. Looks really nice!
After this the demo breaks abrupt. I think there must be some more, 'cause I've
read something about greetings at  the program-file and there is another module
included, made by GOLDY and 505. Don't know why it doesn't run...
Ok, all in one it's a nice little demo and in my eyes  also a bit better as the
demo of ESCAPE, because  there are more effects included. But the  demo suffers
from the  lack of design and  the nearly not existing grafix, but  it's not bad
and if you own a  Falcon you should get it, if you like demos... So I'm waiting
for the next Therapy-release this year...
