                                VARIOUS ARTISTS
                                 "STRANGE LOVE"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

compiled by Deathwish Office / Nuclear Blast & Orkus Magazine

As you can see on the title of this sampler it could be something like a tribut
to Depeche Mode or  something like that. The cover shows a rose (like VIOLATOR)
and this  CD contains the creme-de-la-creme of the synthie-pop/electronic music
scene. There are new and old tracks  included (also some great club-hits). Only
one track doesn't match to the others...
Ok, at first for the contents:

01. DEEP RED - "Red"
02. DEINE LAKAIEN - "Dark Star" (2nd mix)
03. AND ONE - "FÅr"
04. APOPTYGMA BERZERK - "Mourn"
05. SILENCE - "La Troia"
06. BORN FOR BLISS - "Arabia" (dessert mix)
07. SILKE BISCHOFF - "Silent War"
08. LA FLOA MALDITA - "Sorciere"
09. PHILTRON - "Abberation"
10. INSIDE - "November Day" (mind mix)
11. CHINESE DETECTIVES - "Situation"
12. STATIC ICON - "It's A Lifestyle"
13. BLIND PASSENGERS - "Universe"
14. BEBORN BETON - "The Colour Of Love"
15. INFAM - "Intense"
16. DISTAIN! - "You Mean Everything"
17. THE DREAMSIDE - "Apaika"
18. SYNTEC - "Eternity"

As I had written above one song isn't right here on this sampler. It's the song
of THE DREAMSIDE. It isn't synth-pop or something like that and I don't like it
very much. The  others are  sometimes very  old-fashioned (like the  one of the
CHINESE DETECTIVES... produced  by VINCE CLARK...) or with first steps to cross
over (BLIND PASSENGERS). The  best songs  are  from  DEINE LAKAIEN (my absolute
fave on  this CD), of course  AND ONE, APOPTYGMA BERZERK, BORN FOR BLISS, SILKE
BISCHOFF (even if it's  a very slow song) and a lot of the others. No question,
if you want an  overview about  the synth-pop-scene  this sampler  is the right
thing for you. I will not describe the  single songs here and I think the style
of this music needs also  no description. Just go  to your next record-shop and
listen to this album. But I  think you can  buy without  listening if  you like
this style of music...

DEEP RED - "RED" (Candyland Entertainment)

Fallen, one more try.
Confused, I do cry
Farewell to childhood play.
Crazy, so soon will stray.

Maybe I won't see red,
count your blessings attead.
Lonely, hearts faint you
Mystic, can't reach you
night comes, the sky turns red.
Union, another threat.

Maybe I won't see red,
count your blessings attead.
Can't hide what they all said
Crazy thoughts in my head.

DEINE LAKAIEN - "DARK STAR" (Class X / Chrom Records)

Wandering about in an universe
Back and forth - torn
Strandgoods of the galaxies
Back and forth - torn
Exhausted, starved, yet still a hunter
Hidden, lurking behind some planets
In narrow lanes, in narrow lanes...

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me.

How long ago when I ran into you
Spark discharges - dazzled
Since that moment I've lost my way
Back and forth - dazzled
Exhausted, starved, yet still a hunter
Hidden, lurking behind some planets
"Faster! Faster!"

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me.

Moons and planets passing by
Faded through light - blind
Men forged to black mountains
Faded through love - blind
Screens may be distorted
Radars may be deaf
Hunting for love, hunting for love.

Dark star you are the light of my night
Dark star won't you be my guide
Dark star why do you run from me
Dark star why don't you kill me.

AND ONE - "FöR" (Modern Music)

Die Hand, die selten fÅhrt
Sie zeigt, den tiefsten Punkt
Im Weg immer wÑhrend
auf unseren letzten wahren Grund.

Ein Gebet, ein Wunsch, ein Gedicht
welches uns zu helfen vermag
FÅr die Garde der letzten Zweifler
Marschbefehl zum morgigen Tag

und die Sterne, die mich fÅhren
in der WÅste ausgesetzt
Dein Herz, eine Granate
die mich auseinander fetzt

Ich mal' ein Kreuz fÅr Dich
Auf einem Himmelbreit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit
Die Geraden treffen mich
Auf dem Kreuz der Ewigkeit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit

Wir leben in der WÅste
und wir kÑmpfen in der Stadt
Wir atmen all die Leere
die die Lust von uns genommen hat

FÅr die Gier, das nie erreichte
hungernd voller Lebenslust
Diese LÅgen in der Beichte
hab' den Glauben nie vermiût.

Ich mal' ein Kreuz fÅr Dich
Auf einem Himmelbreit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit
Die Geraden treffen mich
Auf dem Kreuz der Ewigkeit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit

FÅr die Bettler
die nicht stehlen wollen
FÅr die Mîrder
die uns Leben schenken
FÅr all die Narren an der Macht
FÅr den WÑchter der mich bewacht

Ich mal' ein Kreuz fÅr Dich
Auf einem Himmelbreit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit
Die Geraden treffen mich
Auf dem Kreuz der Ewigkeit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit

FÅr alle Spieler, die nie spielten
FÅr alle die Treffer der GewÑhlten
FÅr die, die nie ankommen
FÅr die, die wir verbergen.

Ich mal' ein Kreuz fÅr Dich
Auf einem Himmelbreit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit
Die Geraden treffen mich
Auf dem Kreuz der Ewigkeit
Zu zweit ein Leben weit

APOPTYGMA BERZERK - "MOURN" (Tatra Productions)

Lost in the depths
The depths of your eyes.
I couldn't resist, why should I?

I want to relax,
I want to feel free
I want to be you, you want to be me.

I look at you, I look at your face.
Reach for my hand, just in case.
Forever with you.
You mourn, I can see.
Now I am you, do you wanr (to be) me?

Why are you always hiding?

Why are you always mourning?

Why are you always hiding?

Why are you always mourning?

SILENCE - "LA TROIA" (Chrom Records)

Dance girl, here before me
Dance with passion, my Salome
The ice gets cooler as the heat increases
You'll have to crawl before tasting her kisses.

You've got it all - Don't give it away
You've got it all - Niente rimarra

Smooth movements caress the dancefloor
She's a desert isle worth being ship-wrecked for
She's welcome as a sin
As sweet adrenalin
She's the most exciting game
Even though you just can not win

You've got it all - Don't give it away
You've got it all - Niente rimarra

Watch her slide, Beyond shame
Beyond false morale
so shallow, so vain
Where there is smoke, there's also fire
Wherever she is, there is desire.

The stars - obstajajo samo se v glavi
The world - je okrogel, vendar z vogali
The blood - se ni voda, je pa na poti pravi
Welcome to your life - v naprej izgubljeni stavi.

BORN FOR BLISS - "ARABIA" (Deathwish Office / Nuclear Blast)

Sometimes you can here me calling
Calling for Arabia
In my dreams you lead me
To the desert land of Asia.

SILKE BISCHOFF - "SILENT WAR" (A.M. Music)

Another rainy day
in this silent war
I think it's too late
crying like a child
'cause we've gone too far
another rainy night
in this silent war
I think it's too late
crying like a child
'cause we've gone too far
we're in a silent war
we've gone too far
we're in a silent war
we've gone too far

LA FLOA MALDITA - "SORCIêRE" (Kodex / Sushia Light)

moi, je t'ai dÇnudÇ
dÇja tu as rÇvelÇ
ta vie double Ö moi
je pourrais te trahir

c'est toi la sorciÇre

toi la sociÇre

c'est toi, fais attention, il y a
une chasse aux sorciÇres
si toi, fais attention, il y a une
chasse aux sorciÇres

rÇflÇchis bien ce que tu, ce
que tu va faire
ton maåtre, to sorcier
ne te cherche pas, il ne
t'aide plus

c'est toi las sorciÇre

je te poursuivrai

c'est toi, fais attention,
il y a unse chasse aux sorciÇres
si toi, fais attention, il y a...
si toi!

PHILTRON - "ABBERATION" (Candyland Entertainment)

Finally I lost my way, seraching for the fading light
Not even a sign where I am, just not knowing where to be
Moving left or going right, climbing higher I decide
Did I see this place before, never been here, I am sure

Secluded nature all raound, all nightmares turn to stone
Seeking for the outlet now, stepping forward, can't let go
Shouting out a single word, the echos in my ear seem dull
The daytrip's end is yet so far, no way out, my heart devines

Misty clouds raise everywhere, further searching I won't dare
Gorges are not far away, gliding off, going astray
Coldest fear and resignation, freezing the forgotten soul
Balancing along the ridge, needing a securely hold

Longing for the saving edge, pulling up my tortured self
This no longer can I bear, fainting there right at this place
Dropping in unconciousness, no more pain and no more tears
Should I have reached the border, shall it come here to the end?

INSIDE - "NOVEMBER DAY" (Daydream / Chrom Records)

I was feeling so alone
I tried to share some kind of love
But the promise was left to fate

You took a broken wing
And tried to mend a dream
This is a winter's day

Now I'm feeling so needed
But holding out for wanting
I don't know what I'm doing here

You've stolen all the words
I'd never wanted to say
November Day
You've broken all the hearts
They've ever given out
November Day

You took the golden ring
And threw it all away
The frost is threatening

Now I'm only hearing you
Far away from my eyes
I hoped that it might change

The story can't explain...

CHINESE DETECTIVES - "SITUATION" (Mute / Tatra)

Blue eyed dressed for every situation
moving through the doorway of the nation
pick me up and shake the doubt
baby I can't do without

move out
don't mess around
move out
you bring me down
move out
how do you get about
don't make a sound just move out

I remember only for an hour
moves right through me can you feel the power
I don't know what's going on
scares me but it won't be for long

move out...

Now he's in controlled he is my lover
naions stands against him he's your brother
been a long time, a long time now
I'll get to you somehow

move out...

STATIC ICON - "IT'S A LIFESTYLE" (Dark Wings / Modern Music)

Come dress me up with all desire
with intentions that are far from good.
Such love ignites the burning fire
that came to be misunderstood.
You're telling me I've gotta be
somebody else inside of me.
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Oh can't you see?
It's a lifestyle, where I can do what please,
I can't even change for somebody else.
Just let me be.
Oh can't you see?
Just think of all the souls
that died from suppression of their own desire.
So tell me, did they have to lie?
Suppressed of love, stripped of pride.
You can't harm me now...
Pride is what I've found.

BLIND PASSENGERS - "UNIVERSE" (Synthetic Symphony)

Where is the light assigning my fate?
Where is my place?
For what I await?
Show my true worth - dark universe!

Where you created a long time ago,
the walls I can't break, the ways I can't go?
Show my true worth - dark universe!

Are we only test objects for a higher race,
nothing more than small microbes,
smaller than a grain - microbes with a face?

Where is the light assigning my aim,
my craving for sex, my craving for fame?
Show my true worth - dark universe!

Where you decided a long time ago,
the day I will die, the day I will go?
Show my true worth - dark universe!

(Show my true worth - dark universe
...I know I broke my word - dark universe!)

BEBORN BETON - "THE COLOUR OF LOVE" (Strange Ways)

You take my nerves - you bring me sorrow
I reach out for a hatchet seeking entry
Your time is running out - there's no excuse

And after all you smile
You try in making fun of me
You're simply irresistable
The colour of your hair is the colour of love

Make me believe that it all lies in our hand
And when you close your eyes for me
I seem to understand

I must admit I miss your smile
But all that lingers on is in my head
All that is left of you - memories...

So I decend - le souterrain
And I tear you down the wall that hides my love
You are still beautiful
The colour of your hair is the colour of love

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

INFAM - "INTENSE" (Svenska Energy)

but now let me feel
make your love real
and just say it to me:
come on let's do it!

you knocked me down
injured, I'm staying here
I have never thought that
you could do things like that
could I comprehend your actions
we'd known us at that time
you gave your body
you gave him much more
but now I'm staying here
bleeding is my heart again
but now just make love
I want you at all

but now let me feel
make your love real
and just say it to me:
come on let's do it!

you've got me in your hand
I'm devoted to you
you've got me in your hand
let me understand
how you feel and let me feel
you've got me in your hand
I'm devoted to you

...

DISTAIN! - "YOU MEAN EVERYTHING" (Daydream / Chrom Records)

I will never give you up
Beleive me girl I need you
Freedom is just another word
For nothing left to loose

How often have I told you
And how many times have I promised you
That we can stay together
If you want to

And you mean everything to me
As more than you can feel now
And there is nothing else to say
Don't go away

You don't try to look inside
To see what's going on with me
The words you say and games you play
Will bring me down again

Please don't keep me waiting
'Cause I know that you love me, too
We can stay together
I just want you

I can't go on anyway
If you're not here in every moment
I need you every day, I need you
Don't go away

Qu'est ce que tu cherche

SYNTEC - "ETERNITY" (Dark Wings / Modern Music)

The autumn of life turns into winter
We are falling down like leafs
And Grim Reaper proves to be a tempter
What is left is our belief

Is there someone waiting for you (or for me)?
Is there someone waiting for you in eternity?

New generation has taken over
We are asking for advice
And Grim Reaper proves to be a drover
What is left is paradise

Is there someone...
