                                   FEEDBACK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also this time we've received  a lot of letters and reactions and will give you
here a short overview...

I want to congratulate you for the UCM! It was really good.
(...)
I think the best way for the Undercover magazine is to be on the net! I've told
The Beast  for his  Toxic Mag. Why not make  a common Html magazine? It will be
better and would touch more people.

editors note: Thanx for the laurels. We had thought about a Html based UCM, but
              this time we  had no active  coder. The  problem is that the only
              .tnb.-member (FXL) who could make this true (the only one who can
              code Html... at least a little bit) is  inactive since months. We
              have  nothing heard  from him  and I don't  know what he is doing
              today. On the other side  it would not  have the  diskmag-feeling
              (it's my personal view). Ok, we  could reach much more poeple and
              also on other systems but I don't know if this is worth the work.
              So I will ask all  the others: Should we try to make a Html-based
              issue of UCM?! Of course only besides the  diskmag-shell (we have
              worked  too much  on it  to reject  it now). Write us and tell us
              what you think about this!
              Ups, I have to write a little update: SLAPSHOT of SHELTER & ELITE
              will eventually help us, if we will release a HTML-based UCM! But
              this means MUCH work  for me (grafix-stuff =( ...) and so it will
              take a lot of time. Don't expect first results in the next months
              because it's summer and I don't want to  spent my whole free time
              and holidays in front of my computer :)

I liked your UCM SILI edition.

Keep on writing your mag. It's cool and the scene needs it!

Will Undercover carry on? You seemed very negative in your letter in Maggie 23.
I like  Undercover, it's a  good  read (well  apart  from the  incrompehensible
articles in german :^] ) and  it would be a shame to see it go. What you should
not  do is put  lots of messages in  Undercover  saying "Write or we will close
down" as  this does  not give  your readers  much  confidence, and  is not very
inspiring either. If you  carry on and make  sure you  maintain a good quality,
eventually you should attract new writers. Look  at Maggie, when CiH took over,
it looked like it  was the end of  Maggie, but he continued and now we're going
stronger than ever.
One thing though. Sort out your shell! The magazine starts with a stylish intro
and then half  the time won't go  into the magazine. I think the problem is the
sound routine. One register of the  sound ship controls some of the floppy disk
handling  and I think your programmer  has not been  protecting these bits from
change. Also I would like the ability to quit the shell to the desktop too.
This is not very hard to do is it? So do it!

PS. CHEER UP!

editors note: Many thanx again  for your  letter (as I  have the  first slopped
              away... sorry)... Hm, what should I say? UNDERCOVER will go on!
              Be sure! Today I  don't  think that  we will  stop it in the next
              time. Meanwhile we have received a lot of messages and letters of
              guys which like our mag very much and this motivates, no question
              (we have received  much  more feedback as  in the german times of
              Undercover...). We will go  on as  long as there  is a need for a
              scene-mag. If the  scene dies  finally sometimes and  there isn't
              enough potential  left to release the mag at  least two times per
              year, we will stop  it, because  I don't  want to  go back to the
              craptalk-times... I think  there  are enough  mags  around  which
              entertain  the readers  with several  things and  there isn't the
              need for another mag of this kind. So we have specialised the UCM
              on the scene-sector and I think we have found our little niche to
              go on for the next few  years. But some  info about  my letter to
              CiH... I had  some private problems this time  and so my mood was
              already down as I had written this letter. I think  you'll under-
              stand me, if I write the following word: girls... You understand?
              Hum. Other stuff. The buggy shell... I've telled  the coder about
              this, but he's very lazy and I think  the bugs  will survive some
              more issues. I know, it's shit, but I cannot tie him to the ST...
              So I cannot promise the simplest  stuff and I'm very  glad to see
              that he will do something for the shell from time to time...
              Ok, that's all for this and I wish you all the best for your game
              project! It's one of the most promising ST-games of the last time
              and I think many guys will register for it! It's great stuff!

Hiya!

First of all, i  want to tell you that  Undercover  is a really interesting mag
esp for the scene news! Long life to this mag and their supporters!
(...)

Sebastien a.k.a _sENSEr_

editors note: Yep! Thanx! We'll do our best to  make the UCM to the best scene-
              magazine for the ST and Falcon and I think we're on the right way
              (as the most letters we have received up to now) show...
              Thanx also for your help and if there would more guys around like
              you it would be really great, because  it makes also a little bit
              more fun  to work on  the mag if there are  some guys  which will
              help to make it much more interesting... 
              Also all  the best  for the  Toxic Mag! Hope  to see it sometimes
              again, because it would be very sad if it would leave the scene.

Hiya Moondog!

Yeah, this letter I wanted write to you long time  ago, but I ever said: "Maybe
tomorrow..." And days passed. But as you can see I did it finally! :))

I really like  your disk magazine, called  Undercover! I find  I enjoy  it more
each  time I read new  issues. You are  doing really good job, Moondog! I don't
saw yor magazine before SILIconvention, so it was really cool to see that there
is another  magazine for us, Atari users. I am really very gratefull to Drizzt/
TNB that he told me about it! (give my beST wishes for him!)

I appreciated  enormously a  whole job, which  you are doing  Moondog! I really
understand how it must be hard to continue a whole magazine by yourself.
Everybody  want to read  a magazine, but  nobody want  to help you... It's very
sad...

Let's hope that it will be changed soon :))

(...)

C ya l8er Moondog, and keep doing a great job!

With grtx 4 U and all guyz of TNB:

editors note: Heyho Grey! mOd told  me that you wanted  to get in touch with me
              and as you have finally done it (many people say only: "Yes, I'll
              contact you sometimes..." and you don't  hear anything from them)
              I was  really pleased. It's  nice to  hear that you  like the UCM
              very much, but please let me  remark that  this issue  of the UCM
              isn't only my personal work. Ok, I have  written many articles by
              myself, but without the help  of mOd and MC Laser  of .tSCc. this
              issue would not be ready today. They're  doing also  a great job,
              especially with their scene-work. Because I don't have a modem or
              Internet-access it would be very  hard for me  to make the UCM as
              actual and interesting  as it is. Even  if I do the  main-work ->
              putting together and the  so called "coordination" it is the work
              of many different guys. Without  them the UCM  would be  the same
              uninteresting craptalk-mag today as some years ago...
              Ok, last note: I'm very anxious to see your new scene-mag! :)
