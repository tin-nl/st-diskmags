I've seen this game at first at the InterCon '96 and was very surprised of this
because it offers a quality which is lost on the most games which were released
for the ST in the last years (even the commercial ones).
What is it? HEARTLAND is a great platformer in Dizzy-style (You surley remember
to the budget-games made by the codemasters.). You have to  run around in a BIG
level (I mean really big! You need  the build in map!) and searching  for coins
and also game-cards which are lost. They  laying around  in the level or you'll
get them by passing teleport-dors.
There aren't any enemies in  the game, only  some (good placed ;-) spikes which
are decreasing your energy. When your energy  is going to zero  you'll die. But
in the level you can find some potions for refreshing your lifepoints.
The game  is finished if  you were died  or if you have collected all the game-
cards... In this game you must only collect the  heart-cards (-> Heartland) and
it is possible that  the guys behind  the game will do successor-games with all
the other cards.
Ok, I'll  go over to  the technical side of the game. Hum. The grafix  are very
nice and  also good  for the ST, colourful, detailed  and your  sprite  is good
animated (even if this  is the only  animation :-( ... and it's DIZZY! Yes, the
egg from the Codemasters-games! This gives the game a touch of revival.
There aren't many  musix on  the ST, only short  snippets of Mad Max sounds and
the usual chip-FX. Because I haven't a STE to test the game I don't know how it
is on this machine. In the readme-file was mentioned that the STE has music...
The control of your hero is  easy, even if  you'll sometimes bite in your stick
because of the tricky ways.
You have a save-option and also a saveable highscore, this saves the motivation
much more.
What should I say? If you have a ST  and you don't know what you should play in
the evening  just get  this game! It's  one of the  best games I've seen in the
last time!
