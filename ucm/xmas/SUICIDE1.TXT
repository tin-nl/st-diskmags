               yourself under the Xmas-tree. I know, the festival of love makes
               some  guys  very  depressive  and with this guide I think we can
               help you to finish your worthless life in a spectacular way. ;-)

OK, here  is the methods  file again. I don't now who initially wrote it, but I
plagiarized it and am re-posting it for the benefit of all. Note the new one on
** ==Helium gas (new addition to list).

==NOTES
   This list is compiled  from a large  number of  sources, the main  one being
   this  newsgroup (ASH). I have  not named  anyone in any  of the  entries  to
   ensure their privacy.

   There may be inaccuracies in many of the entries... double check if you can.
   Go to the library and read up on your favorite method - check dosages in the
   manufacturer's data  sheets. If you do notice any inaccuracies, please write
   to the net ASAP.

==LEGAL
   This file is provided  for the purposes  of amusement, and the actual use of
   any of  these methods is  not recommended  without  first  considering other
   possibilities, such as dying of  old age. Please do not pass  it onto people
   whom  you know to be  actively suicidal.. you may  find yourself in jail for
   considerable periods. I have a small amount of info on British law regarding
   assisting suicides; feel free  to ask me for a copy. Basically, distribution
   to a  number of unknown people is  fine, but  giving it to  someone whom you
   know is  actively  considering suicide  can get  you into jail  for up to 14
   years.

   I should also point out that this file is distributed  world-wide, and there
   will be significant differences in the legal aspects in other countries.
