        UNDERCOVER VOLUME VIII{*f0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               >The 3rd Undead One<

Here's a little preview on the next regular magazine!

Ok, what you'll read in the Undercover issue 8? Erm, it's hard to  say  because
we don't know how  this magazine here will be spreaded and so we don't know how
much help we'll receive for the next issue...
But some  things are relative  safe. The scene-corner will be  more interesting
because we have some more interviews with  scene-guys in this magazine. We hope
to get the latest demos for a review and we'll look what's going on in scene...
We hope to get the newest information about the easter-party in Bremen/Germany,
Siliconvention '97 and the other party in Hamburg...
We'll  continue the  scene-report with  Sweden or France (this  isn't safe this
time) and  also our Ultimate  Scene-Homepage Review, which was fucked up in the
issue 7.
At next we will take a look at the latest games for ST and Falcon. We hope that
around Xmas became some games released.
We will  review the newest  CD-ROMs for the  Atari-computers and also new tools
and utilities which will made the life much easier.
For exactly informations take a look at the Xmas-Issue. This will be no regular
issue and it's not 100% safe if we will release one... But I think we can match
it...

Ok, when will  the next  issue be  released? Ok, we  hope that we  can smash it
through your window at the end of march 1997 - at the Fried Bits 4 (?)...

                                 Stay cool! Stay on Atari!
