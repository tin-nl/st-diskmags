C.O.E. is  a new strategy-game for the  Falcon and  someone has said  that this
game looks like Civilisation or so. Now I  have received  the shareware-version
and must say  that it is totally  different. C.O.E. is a fantasy-game with RPG-
features  meanwhile Civilisation is  based on real facts, at least in the first
centuries and the "earth"-scenario.
In this game you have to  conquer a fantasy-world with your armies. You have to
discover the whole world, you must conquer  villages and  cities for increasing
your income and recruiting new armies...
You can  play C.O.E. with  up to 6  human  players  and  additional 7 computer-
controlled players. For  this you have  to select where you will play, what you
will be and so one. For playing the game you must finish many different menus.
At the first menu you have to select the world where you want to  play. You can
select in the shareware-version only the customized scenarios. Random world and
complete scenario are disabled, you also can't load a saved game.
In the  costomize-screen  you can  change the size  of the world, the number of
forrests and  mountains and  the social state (like fallen empire etc.) of your
scenario.
At next you  have to select the players and the  skills of your comp.-opponents
and at last you can  select your  own charakter. You  have to choice of several
fantasy-characters like  Warlord, Priest or  Troll King. Some of the characters
are also disabled.
After typing  your name the game starts and you can seen a map with many little
items on  it. Here it is good to have a VGA-monitor because the items are a bit
too tiny. You have now  some leaders (it all depends  of your chosen character)
to discover  the land and  fight against  the enemies. The  game doesnt  run in
realtime  and so  you  have enough  time to plan  your moves (your  troups have
limited moves). You can change the tax-rates and recruit new armies if you have
conquered new  cities or so. From time  to time you will meet the other players
or independents and the fight begun.
Hum. This sounds easy but it isn't. Ok, the  menu-features are clear but in the
game itself  the control is  very intricate. You have only three little buttons
for all the activities and I don't know how I can activate all the other troups
which were  left in my castle  when my leader is out of order. There is no help
available and  this is a bit  frustrating. Even  in the easiest game-mode I was
killed bfore the tenth move, I don't know...
Ok, the technical  side: the  grafix are ok, in  the game itself they are a bit
simple. Menu-design is ok and some of the between-pictures are also nice lookin
for me. But the animations of the characters in the fighting-screen are shit...
The sound contains only a music in  the intro. In the game itself you will hear
only some sample from time to time.
... the dullest thing are the only few control-possibilities. All what you have
to do is  to run around in this fantasy-world and  to conquer mines  and cities
and kill  your enemies nothing more and even  if there were about 300 different
enemie-types  included in the  game the motivation flows away after some played
minutes. The game doesn't reach the qualities  of Civilisation in  the depth of
the gameplay.
Ok, it's  a nice designed  game but for  a real strategy-crack it doesnt offers
enough  features to  fascinate him  for longer  as one hour. Also  the disabled
features  will surely  not increase the motivation  and so I must say  that you
should get this version at first to test the game by yourself before buying it.
