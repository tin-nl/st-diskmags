                                    ==PART 3==

                           MEHTODS: OTHER THAN POISONING

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==2. HANGING

==1. asphyxiation (dangle on end of rope for 10 minutes)

Time      : 5 to 10 minutes
Available : Rope, solid support 10 foot above ground
Certainty : Fairly certain (discovery, rope/support snapping)
[Notes]
Brain  damage  likely  if  rescued. Very painful depending on rope. Most common
effective form of suicide in UK. See "Asphyxiation".

==2. breaking neck

Time      : Should be instant if it does break. See previous if not
Available : Rope, solid support, 10 foot space below, several above
Certainty : Very certain if the rope/support doesn't break
[Notes]
Minimal  danger of  discovery (depends on  location). Painless if you  drop far
enough (8  foot  is optimum). Make  sure  that  the  rope  is  tied securely to
something  STRONG!!!  It  has  to  support  your  weight  -MULTIPLIED-  by  the
deccelleration. Use  a hangman's knot (with the knot at the back of your neck).
It doesn't always work this well though, you might get a bust jaw / lacerations
etc and then asphyxiate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==3. JUMPING OFF BUILDINGS

Time      : Instantanious if you are lucky, minutes/hours otherwise
Available : You need ten stories or higher, and access to the top floor windows
            & roof. Bring a bolt cutter to get onto the roof.
Certainty : 90% for 6 stories, increasing after that
[Notes]
Difficult  to  overcome  fear  of  heights, many  people  can't  do it. Totally
painless if  high enough, but very  frightening. Easily discovered if seen on /
near roof / windows. Access fairly easy in a city, otherwise difficult. Risk of
spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair. Ever tried killing  yourself if
you are  paralysed from  the neck down? Email conversations suggest 10+ stories
works ALMOST  all of  the time. Try  to land  on concrete. Quote - "9 out of 10
people who fall 6 stories will die". Note that  it may take a while for many of
those 90% to die.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==4. SLITTING WRISTS OR OTHER (often not effective)

Time      : Minutes if major artery cut, eternity otherwise.
Available : You really  need a razor  sharp knife. Razors  are pretty tricky to
            hold when they are covered with blood.
Certainty : possible if you cut an artery, improbable otherwise
[Notes]
Painful at  first. Danger of discovery. This is a very common suicide 'gesture'
and hardly  ever results  in anything  other than  a scar. A  lot of will power
required to cut deeply into groin or carotid arteries, which are  the only ones
likely  to kill  you. Don't  bother  with this  method. Cutting  your throat is
difficult  due to  the  fact that  the carotid  arteries  are protected by your
windpipe (feel  where your  arteries are with your fingertips, & slice from the
side). I've seen photos of people who have  used this method - the depth of the
cut  required is  amazing. If  you want  to cut your wrists, cut along the blue
line (vein) on the underside of your wrist, but cut deeply  so that the  artery
underneath  is  exposed. Cut  this  lengthways  with  a  razor  or similar. The
traditional hot bath does help, since it keeps the blood flowing quickly, slows
down clotting, and is nice to lie back and relax in. Position yourself  so that
your wrists don't fall inwards against your body, blocking off blood flow.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==5. BULLET

Time      : Microseconds unless you are unlucky (mins/hours)
Available : Difficult in UK, easier in USA (get a shotgun)
Certainty : Certain
[Notes]
Painless  if worked, otherwise  painful & brain  damage. Danger of discovery of
weapon  or ammunition. Not at all common in UK, more  common in USA  where guns
available.  Brain  damage  &  other  effects   if  you   survive. Death  either
instantaneous, or prolonged. Lots of will power needed to fire gun ('hesitation
marks' are bullets/pellets embedded in the  wall, when  you jerk the gun as you
fire). Bullet can miss vital parts in skull, deflect  off skull. If  you have a
choice, use a shotgun rather than a rifle of a pistol, since it is so much more
effective. ("shotgun"  entry  later). Ammunition  to  use  is:  .458 Winchester
Magnum, or soft-point slugs with .44 Magnum. Also  you could use a sabot round,
which is a plastic wedge with  a smaller thing  in it. These  rounds are rather
overkill, the  phrase "elephant gun" has  been used  about the .458 Winchester,
but  if you're  going to  go, do  it with a bang. Note, people  usually survive
single .22  shots to  the temples. The  other  problem  with guns is that is is
bloody  messy. Your  next of  kin will  really _enjoy_ cleaning  up  after you,
washing the coagulated blood & brains out of corners etc...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==6. ASPHYXIATION

Time      : 5 mins to unconciousness, 10+ mins to brain death
Available : Anywhere there's a rope and something solid to tie it to
Certainty : Certain, if yoou don't get "rescued"
[Notes]
Panic  reaction is  very  likely (unless  inert  gasses used). One  of the most
effective  and most used  methods of suicide. Probable brain damage  if you are
"rescued". NOTE, this can only really be done in two ways: firstly, when you're
unconsious (eg, sleeping  pills), or secondly, by hanging. Combining  with pure
inert gasses is a very good suggestion. See "Nitrogen" in the poisons section.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==7. AIR IN VEINS (basically just a myth)

Time      : Couple of minutes claimed
Available : Plenty of air about... Need a hypodermic & syringe
Certainty : only 1 known case.. patient may already have been dead
[Notes]
The only  case I know about, it  killed with 40cc of  air. Smaller amounts  are
harmless. The case was the death of Abbie Borroto, who died in 1950 from a 40cc
injection in New Hampshire. She died in minutes. This was the 1949 Dr H. Sander
case. He was found not guilty  to murder  on the  grounds that  the patient may
already have been dead when he gave the injection. (A doctor and a nurse  could
find no pulse earlier the same day). The following 2 quotes are from [1]: Prof.
Y. Kenis  says: "... not  a suitable  method, nor  a gentle  death... extremely
difficult  to utilize  as a  method  of suicide. .. possibly with  very serious
consequences, such  as paralysis or permanent brain  damage. .. this is only an
impression, and I have no real scientific information on the subject."
Dr Pieter V. Admiraal .. describes the theoretical air bubble method of suicide
as  impossible, disagreeable  and  cruel. "To kill  somebody with air you would
have to inject at least 100 -> 200 millilitres as quickly as possible in a vein
as big  as possible  close to the heart. You would have to fill the whole heart
with air at once. The heart would probably beat on for several minutes, perhaps
5 -> 15 minutes, and during the first minutes the person may be conscious."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==8. DECAPITATION

Time      : Couple of seconds before conciousness fades
Available : Happen to have a train line nearby? Or a guillotine perhaps?
Certainty : Very certain, unless you pull away just before
[Notes]
See "jumping in  front of trains". May be difficult  to stop pulling  your head
out of the way - OD on sleeping tablets first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==9. DISEMBOWELMENT (aka seppuku/hara kiri)

Time      : Minutes
Available : Got a nice razor-sharp sword?
Certainty : Fairly certain, assuming that you managed to gut yourself  properly
            before passing out with the agony
[Notes]
Painful, even the  macho Samurai  used  a 'second' to  decapitate  them at  the
appropriate  point,  so  don't  expect  to do  much  more  than  give  yourself
peritonitis. Trendy  for insane  martial arts  fanatics and  gay Japanese poets
called Mishima.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==10. DROWNING

Time:      Minutes (5 mins to die of drowning, 20 to die of hypothermia)
Available: Anywhere there's deep, (cold) water in a remote spot
Certainty: Good, just make sure you sink & can't swim
[Notes]
Put stones  in your  pockets, tie your legs & hands together, and  hop into the
lake.. bit of  a shock to the  fisherman who finds your rotting corpse stuck in
his brand new net. Also see entry for "hypothermia/freezing". However, remember
that you can be  revived  from cold water drowning after several hours, because
the  cold  slows down  terminal brain  damage. Warmer  water  doesn't have  the
advantage of hypothermia, but is more effective in making sure you *stay* dead.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==11. ELECTROCUTION

Time      : Seconds / minutes
Available : Anywhere with high-tension, high-current lines & a good earth
Certainty : Somewhat dependant on luck & how much power goes through you
[Notes]
Don't bother  with 110 or 240 volt  mains, its just  not enough. Some people do
get killed with household electricity, but only after several minutes. Use high
tension  lines, stand  in bare feet on waterlogged  ground (better still, but a
piece of THICK copper cable into the nearest river). Works best if current path
travels through your head or through the heart. Just burns you badly otherwise.
NOTE: people  have  survived  massive  high-voltage, high-current  shocks  with
nothing  but  3rd degree  burns  to  show  for  it. Sometimes  paralysis, limbs
amputated etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==12. EXPLOSIVES

Time      : 10 milliseconds, or similar (!)
Available : Difficult to get hold of detonator & good explosives
Certainty : Certain if detonator works properly
[Notes]
DON'T USE GUNPOWDER  or other 'slow' explosives (eg, homemade  explosives). Use
dynamite or 'Plastique', strap it to your forehead with the detonator and BOOM!
The main problem is with getting hold of high explosives (I know the recipe for
Nitro-Glycerine, but  home manufacture  is extremely  risky, and the product is
unstable). If  you can  get a  grenade, use  it, it's  probably the best way of
doing this one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==13. FREEZING TO DEATH (hypothermia)

Time      : several hours (15 minutes in very cold water)
Available : Got a large chest freezer? Is the outside temp < -10 degrees?
Certainty : good if you don't get found
[Notes]
Soak your cloths in water, get into freezer / outside somewhere where you won't
be found. Helps to get pissed  first - drink yourself silly. If  you are near a
very cold supply of water (eg the North Sea, or similar) which is close to zero
degrees, this  is particularly  good, since  the average lifespan of someone in
the water is 15 minutes.
[1] says:
".. have  quietly ascended their favorite mountain late in the day .. above the
 freezing  line.. wearing  light clothing, they  sat down in a secluded spot to
 await  the end. Some  have said  that they  intended to take a tranquilizer to
 hasten the sleep of death. From what  we know of  hypothermia, they would pass
 out as the cold reached a certain level and they would die within a few hours.
 Of course in a very cold climate there is no need to climb a mountain."
[eg, UK in midwinter :-). There was a death in the middle of the city park here
just this last winter ('90) where a lady stripped after the park closed for the
night.]
A problem with this method is that because it slows the metabolism and prevents
damage  to  the  brain, people  can  be  revived  several  hours  after 'death'
occasionally.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==14. JUMPING IN FRONT OF TRAINS

Time      : Seconds (or hours if unlucky)
Available : Anywhere near a HIGH-SPEED railway line
Certainty : Depends on your timing & speed of train. Go for decapitation
[Notes]
Probably  better  to  put  your  neck  on the line, since a glancing blow would
probably break  your spine (& cripple you). High  speed trains need a kilometer
to stop, so find a blind corner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==15. SELF-IMMOLATION

Time      : Seconds to days
Available : Anywhere you can get petrol & a match
Certainty : good as long as you are far away from medical help
[Notes]
Bloody painful - one  of the most agonising ways to die. If you do survive, you
will  be disfigured for  the rest of  your life. Try mixing  the petrol with an
explosive  like TNT  or NG, this  will make  it burn  MUCH quicker, even if the
explosive is very dilute.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==16. STARVING TO DEATH

Time      : 40 days give or take. Depends on health.
Available : Anywhere where you can't be force-fed
Certainty : Good as long as no medical help & will power holds up
[Notes]
Supposed to be easier after the first couple of days, since your appetite goes.
In a UK prison, you can't be force-fed unless you give permission first, or are
diagnosed insane, but I don't know whether this is the same in other countries.
Beware - relatives might give permission on your behalf if you  are unconsious.
(living  will / durable  power of  attorney  helps). It  may help if you use an
appetite suppressant. Amphetamines, and some drugs (MDMA, AKA XTC, AKA ecstasy,
AKA metheylenedimethoxymethamphetamine is one such). The problem with  these is
that they are frequently illegal. I've also heard of something  called Aminorex
(4-methylaminorex) which was briefly prescribed as an appetite suppressant, but
taken  off  the  market  since  it  had fatal side effects... which is hardly a
problem!!
[1] says:
".. after approximately 20 % of body weight loss, illness will begin to set in,
 notably  severe  indigestion,  muscle  weakness, and  _worst  of  all_  mental
 incapacity. ... about 40 days before life is seriously theatened.    ...."
"In some  cases  self-starvation  can  be  very painful. ... morphene had to be
 administered to kill the pain of fatal dehydration. .."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==17. DRIVING INTO BRIDGE SUPPORT AT 100 MPH

Time      : Hopefully instantanious
Available : Fast car, motorway, unprotected bridge....
Certainty : So-so, put a couple of cans of petrol on the passenger seat to make
            it certain, & USE YOUR SEATBELT
[Notes]
Bridges  are usually  protected  in the UK, don't  know about  USA. Avoid being
thrown out  of the car  by using the  seatbelt, and put petrol (in cans or just
splashed about) near to the driver's seat just to make  certain. Can be made to
look accidental.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==18. SHOTGUN

Time      : Instantanious if you are lucky
Available : Difficult in UK, easier in USA (due to gun laws)
Certainty : Fairly certain
[Notes]
12-gauge  shotgun  with  3  inch  Magnum  shells  with #2 to #000 buckshot. See
"Bullet" for  other  points. This  is  the  recommended  way to die by firearm.
Apparently  the  shells  suggested  here  are "extreme overkill", but thats the
point really... problem here is that its amazingly messy - who is going to pick
the  festering lumps  of gore out of the carpet?  Another problem is that it is
possible to miss your brain entirely, and just blow off your face instead.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==19. ENLIST (silly)

Time      : Jan 15 '91 or other conflict
Available : Just pop down to the local army office & sign on as a squaddie
Certainty : Be a "hero". Life expectancy in a battle is 20 minutes
[Notes]
I don't think  this is an entirely serious suggestion, particularly  since only
10% ever see the front line, and only a few of those ever see combat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==20. PENCILS UP YOUR NOSE, BANG DOWN ONTO TABLE (urban legend?)

Time      : Seconds or never
Available : All you need is a couple of sharp pencils and a table
Certainty : Very uncertain
[Notes]
This is  a myth, I think, since  the pencils would go into  your frontal lobes,
which are basically optional. This is the legendary "exam suicide". Fine if you
want a DIY frontal-lobotomy rather than death!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==21. GETTING SOMEONE TO MURDER YOU

Time      : Depends on method used
Available : Know any murderous psychopaths? No, not the tax people...
Certainty : Depends on method used, & dedication of murderer
[Notes]
Forget it. Unless  you contract  someone to do it, the chances are that you are
going to wake  up in hospital without your wallet. If  you do contract someone,
how are you going to pay them? Can't  take them to court  for running  off with
your money and not doing the job.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==22. MAKE YOURSELF INTO AN H-BOMB (another silly one)

Time      : Speed of light over 1/2 metre (couple of nanoseconds)
Available : Nuke (fission OR fusion), 10 litres of heavy water
Certainty : 100%
[Notes]
Drink the  heavy water for several days, strap  yourself to the nuke, and press
the  button. If  you  retained  a  couple  of  litres  of  the heavy water, the
additional  yield  should  be  6  megajoules (give  or  take  a  few  orders of
magnitude). Note  that heavy  water is  a poison, so you might not survive that
long anyway.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==23. MICROMACHINES/NANOCOMPUTERS (science fiction)

Time      : years or a fraction of a second - depends how you look at it
Available : in 50 -> 1000 years time?
Certainty : Good assuming that the technology is developed
[Notes]
Basically, this  involves  a 'replicator' panel. You  program  it  to replicate
yourself, simplifying very slightly, with the exception of the urge to use this
technique. After a while, you turn into a mindless zombie, trudging around from
the exit of the machine  to the  entrance, for eternity. Strange  philosophical
implications.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==24. SCUBA-DIVING (various fatal 'accidents')

Time      : see notes -most are minutes/hours
Available : scuba diving gear, nobody around
Certainty : see notes
[Notes]
The first  method is to  rise 30 metres  or so  without releasing  your breath.
Assuming that you can do it, it should cause your lungs to burst. The second is
the bends - stay under long enough for the nitrogen to  dissolve (30 metres for
30 minutes). Go up rapidly without decompression  time. This is unreliable, and
may  cause brain / joint  damage. The third  way is Carbon Monoxide poisoning -
fill your  tank with it, and stay away from other divers. You  will fall asleep
fairly  quickly. See CO in  poisons section. The final way is oxygen narcosis -
however, this means that you have  to go very deep with an oxygen-rich mix, and
there are problems associated with that. The advantage of these methods is that
insurance  companies /  relatives   will   assume  that  it   was  an  accident
('misadventure'), with  the possible  exception of the CO poisoning. The source
of this  follows: (from the  net) "Rising  30m without  exhaling  will  usually
result in an  over pressured lung, possible subcuteaneous  emphazema, collapsed
lung, death usually from drowning in your own blood. Rather painful and usually
curable if you are rescued, but fair chance of dying if you aren't. Building up
a high  residual  nitrogen  time (say  30m for  30 min) then  coming up without
decompressing  will get you  bent fairly  nicely. You don't feel much, but your
joints tend to start stiffening up after half an hour. Death is very uncertain,
coming  from a stroke. Brain damage, joint damage etc are most  likely. Pobably
can be recued but some damage certain. Oxygen poisoning, going  down 50+m until
the  partial  pressure  of  the  oxygen  reaches  a  toxic  level. Difficult to
accomplish, very painful to get down  that deep, cold pressure etc, possibility
of nitrogen narcosis and forgetting what you are doing. Probably get bent, good
chance of rescue. CO poisoning, mix  a healthy batch of carbon monoxide in your
tank as  you dive, you tend to go to sleep under water, when  combined with the
above methods you have a pretty good winner, don't forget to forget your BCD."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==25. SUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT

Time      : Minutes
Available : You'd need a Puma (TM) robot, & some other bits
Certainty : certain, given proper programming
[Notes]
You  would  need  an  industrial  robot  to  do  this  properly. Give  it a saw
attachment, a sucking tube  attachment, and program it. Make  a head restraint.
When you are fixed securely into the  restraint, start the  robot's program. It
will drill a hole in your head, and stick the tube into the hole. Program it to
wiggle  the tube  back and  forth so  that it doesn't miss anything. This might
work  better if  you put  a stream of water  into the hole as well, so that the
sucking  attachment  doesn't just  suck air all the time. Debugging the program
could be amusing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==26. MICROWAVES

Time      : ?
Available : Source of strong microwave emissions
Certainty : ?
[Notes]
Cooking yourself. Point is to raise your core body temperature to fatal levels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==27. DEHYDRATION

Time      : a week or so?
Available : you need to be able to stop medical help.
Certainty : certain if your will-power stands up to it.
[Notes]
Don't eat  or drink. Remember  that food  contains a high proportion  of water.
Avoiding medical help can be difficult. See 'starving to death'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==28. SKYDIVING 'ACCIDENT'

Time      : pretty damn quick.
Available : need to join a skydiving club.
Certainty : certain.
[Notes]
Join a  skydiving club, continue  to practise  it for a  while to clear off all
suspicions and then once pack your parachute in a real mess (preferably knotted
up, but  not too clearly) and  then jump. The  para will  not open and you will
reach a terminal velocity of 220 km/h (160 mph/120 kn). Death is instant in the
impact with  the Planet  Earth. This  has the advantages of being 'accidental',
and your family / friends do not  have the additional pain and guilt associated
with suicides.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==29. DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS; MODERN VERSION

Time      : variable
Available : a heck of a lot of razor-wire.. maybe a high-voltage supply
Certainty : not very good
[Notes]
This is  a modern variant of the Arabic 'Death of  a thousand cuts'. Basically,
jump onto  a stack of unravelled razor wire, and roll around  till you die.. it
may  help to connect  a highvoltage, low  current power  supply to the wire, so
that  you have  spasms, which  should  keep  you getting cut even when you  are
unconscious. Also, you should make sure that you can't roll off the wire.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==30. CRUSHING

Time      : seconds to minutes, depends on car press
Available : a car press.. any good junkyard
Certainty : certain as long as you can't escape
[Notes]
This is  an elegantly  simple one.. get into a car, in a car press, and shortly
afterwards be squashed to death as your body is converted  into a red  pulp. It
may be tricky getting the press to  trigger, but if you hide in the car someone
may  come along and activate it. There are other ways of  getting crushed, this
just happens to be the most effective I can think up on the spur of the moment.
Getting yourself  run over by  a fully loaded  articulated lorry is quite good.
You should remember that people quite often  survive the  actual crushing; they
die when the weight is taken OFF them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==31. WORLD WAR THREE

Time      : moments if you are near a militarilly significant site
Available : happen to be one of the 'key-holders'? president maybe?
Certainty : pretty certain
[Notes]
All you  have to do  is trigger  world war three. Fire an  ICBM or three at the
Chinese  and the  Russians... This  method  has  the  advantage  that  you take
everyone else  with you! Trouble is, the  number of  people with the  requisite
access is minimal, and I sort of doubt that any readers of ASH can do this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==32. HEATSTROKE

Time      : 4 hours or more
Available : Very hot day; no disturbance from neighbours etc
Certainty : depends on the weather
[Notes]
Basically, the  point is  to give  yourself extreme heatstroke. You should pass
out  after a few  hours. Use  some aluminium foil to direct the sun's heat onto
you, to  speed  up  the  process  a  bit. Try  to  reduce  the  chance of being
interuppted, take off the  phone etc. Obviously, start in the morning! Helps if
the outside temperature is >100F.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==33. ACID BATH

Time      : depends on acid
Available : a lot of a very strong acid
Certainty : fairly good
[Notes] - [from alt.suicide.holiday]
"Summer  heat got  you down? Try the new and improved  neighbourhood acid bath.
 Most metal working plants and some auto-repair shops will have a nice soothing
 acid  bath. This, of  course, is  for those of  you who enjoy extreme pain and
 don't want to make a mess for others  to clean up. If  you don't leave  a note
 chances  are they  will never  know what happened, aside from the shop / plant
 being broken into."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==34. FAKE CAR BOMB

Time      : milliseconds
Available : explosive
Certainty : fairly good if enough explosive
[Notes]
This is a modification of the basic use-explosives method. What you do, is make
a homemade  car bomb, and  drive off happily after chatting with your neighbour
about how well your life is going, apart from a few minor death-threats from an
Iraqi death-squad.. To confuse the  authorities  even more, have a note in your
pocket  listing  the telephone  numbers of all the eastern foreign embassies in
your pocket, together with a little line of random "code numbers" next to each,
and a  random but large  amount of cash listed against each code number. :-) Oh
yes, and a heavily annotated copy of Jane's Defence Weekly - Xhosa edition.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==35. JUMPING OFF BRIDGES (slice and dice with piano wire)

Time      : 9.87 ms-2; 4 to 10 meters; calculate it yourself!
Available : Rope, pianowire and a high bridge.
Certainty : Fairly certain
[Notes]
Never  been tried. Can  also be used  with a fairly high building, but then the
art-motive  will  disappear. Cut  the  rope  and  wire in various lengths. Each
length  must  not be  longer than the height of  the bridge. Tie one end of the
ropes and  wires to  the bridge. Tie the  other part  of the ropes to different
bodyparts  like thigh, calves, torso etc.  Then tie the pianowires  around your
joints. (Don't forget your genitals..) When you jump various  parts of you body
are  whipped away  by the  pianowire  nooses, and  your bits are held up by the
ropes swaying in the breeze. If you to  this right you  should end up with just
your  torso hanging  by it's neck  above the  sea, highway, ground. Do  it with
friends, and call it art.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==36. BEING EATEN ALIVE

Time      : depends, but probably a couple of minutes
Available : zoo, or live in Africa/wherever
Certainty : not brilliant.. what if they're not hungry and don't finish?
[Notes]
Basically, find one or more hungry carnivores... tigers are nice. Also, sharks,
lions, any of the big cats..
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==37. BEING BURNED UP IN UNPROTECTED RE-ENTRY

Time      : probably a few minutes
Available : if you happen to be able to get into orbit
Certainty : about as certain as you can get!
[Notes]
Just go  for a spacewalk  in a low  earth orbit, and decelerate enough to enter
the atmosphere. You'll get a great view...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==38. ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)

Time      : Incubation period 1 to 10 years, death within 2 years  of diagnosis
            of AIDS, Can have HIV for years/decades
Dosage    : Just one intimate contact with an Infected person of any gender
Available : Available to all for free
Certainty : 99.9% certainty AFTER infected
[Notes] - [2]:
This is  not painfree. This  method may  cost  you alot  of money  if you allow
others to get  you medical attention. It may a little difficult to get infected
as people  who know  they have  it may  not comply  with your request. Could be
great  fun attempting  to get  infected  depending upon your attitude (remember
-any gender - you don't have to limit yourself - you're going to die, you might
as well try it ;). Should be quite  devasting to  your family  & close friends.
You also get the satisfaction of leaving behind a virtual unrecognizable-as-you
body! This also gives you the prime  opportunity to  point your finger  at your
dentist and  say he did  it for all the times you have suffered in their chair.
Happy dying!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==39. DEATH BY PAINTING YOUR BODY

Time      : ? Probably less than 8 hours
Dosage    : Less than 1 can of paint depending on your body type
Available : Very available ! You have a  choice of  greasepaint or  House paint
            You need  a type of  paint that will not allow your pores to breath
            in order  to  be  successful  at  this. You  also  have  a smashing
            selection  of colors  you can  choose to  die in! Nile Green? Blood
            Red? Basic Black? Or any combo you desire.. If you  couldn't decide
            before  what  to  wear  to  die  in, this  method  will  cause  you
            considerable angst.
Certainty : This is a sure method, provided  you have a  paint that  will block
            your  pores  from breathing. Don't  forget the bottom of your feet.
            You must paint  every last bit of available skin. If your pores can
            breathe, you won't die.
[Notes]
I read this  in some theater  journal 5 or so years ago, saying when you you do
full  body makeup, you  must insure  that  parts of  the body are left Naked to
breathe  or the actor  will die. Usually for  full body  makeup, they leave the
bottoms of feet, and some patterns on the body, like lines so the actor doesn't
suffocate.

==New methods not added to list yet; raw text

Nitros Oxide:
(so far)
Industrial -- No good. They add chemicals to keep people from abusing it.
Dentist-al -- Great. Perfect. BUT, kinda tricky to get a hold of.
Automotive -- A clever  thought. You  could definately manage to mailorder this
              from an add in hot-nitros-cars magazies.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administration:
An enclose space -- Sounds perfect. Comfortable. A "big box" is my choice.
  SkubaEquipment -- If  you  dive, you're  all  set. Take  your  tank  down  to
                    PerformanceAutomotive for a nitros fill.
 PlasticFaceMask -- Steal one  from your  grandmother. Buy  one from  a medical
                    supply  store. Get  lucky  and  be  in  an "impending plane
                    crash"  situation.  Grab  one  with  the  Nitros  from  the
                    Dentist's Office.
       Gas-Mask! -- Go shopping at you local army supply store!
        Homemade -- Add  some aquarium  tubing  from  the Nitros  canister to a
                    plastic  bad  over  your  head. Aquarium  tubing  from  the
                    canister  that  goes  into  your nose "post surgery" style.
                    Don't forget to tape your mouth closed! Duct tape your face
                    to the canister?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyway  since we're  all here  let me  suggest nerve toxins as a viable suicide
method. In  particular  Antimycin A. There  are NO  antidotes  to this...though
getting  hold of  it could  be quite  difficult. Death  is relatively swift and
painless. Not as aesthetically pleasing as a Bungee
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the posting on methods of killing yourself.

1. Nitrous Oxide=> Available from various car perfomance shops/drag racers etc.
                   In England, try companies such as RipSpeed in London.

2. Cocaine      => Not really  difficult to  get. Maybe in  Newcastle, but  not
                   here in London. Expensive though.

3. LSD          => You are right, it is non-fatal. Good for  suicide, however:-
                   Just take  loads of  trips, and  stand  on a tall  building,
                   railway, middle  of road etc. You will eventually wander off
                   the building, etc.  However, if you survive the attempt, and
                   have taken enough acid, then  you will  visualise like fuck,
                   go into cosmic orbit, and never come down.

4. Guns         => Guns are relatively  easy to get  in the  UK if you know the
                   right people. If not, steal  them - you will be  dead, so it
                   doesn't matter. Just break into  a shop, and do it there and
                   then.

5. Explosives   => Make TNT by  stealing some  methylbenzene, c. Sulphuric, and
                   c.  Nitric  acids. Reflux  them  together  at >70C  until  a
                   precipitate appears.

6. Car crash    => If morals  are not  a problem, drive as fast as you can, and
                   swerve into the oncoming traffic. The crash speed is greater

7. Scuba Diving => Cave diving is a good bet - take 1 cylinder, and  just enter
                   a cave with a torc; and keep going. It will look accidental,
                   and you may see some nice looking fish on the way!

8. Acid Bath    => A case recently where a man killed his wife in an acid bath.
                   He didn't  stun her  first, and  she  struggled  for 3 hours
                   before dying  from her  injuries. Expect  this kind  of time
                   before death occurs. Very painful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, the same disclaimers apply to  this text as the ones  regarding the lists
of how to kill yourself.

Don't go showing this to suicidal people...
