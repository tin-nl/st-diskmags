                               METHODS: POISON

==1. POISON

[1] makes most of these points

*Most drugs  cause vomitting. To help stop this, take one or two antihistermine
 tablets (travel sickness, allergy, hayfever tablets etc) about an hour before,
 on a fairly empty stomach.
*If the drugs are in tablet form, take the first 20% as they are, and the  rest
 crushed  and dissolved / mixed  in with strong alcohol / food. This  helps the
 drugs to hit at the same time.
*Alcohol helps  dissolve the  drugs. Don't drink any  beforehand, but  wash the
 tablets  down with  vodka or similar, and  then drink  afterwards while you're
 still conscious.
*Use a large airtight plastic bag over your head, + something around your  neck
 to hold it on. This transforms a 90% certainty method into a 99%...
*Friday night  is a  good time  if you life  alone - nobody will miss you until
 Monday  if you work. Bolt  all the doors you  can. Say you'll be out  over the
 weekend visiting someone, so people don't expect a reply to telephone.
*Some painkillers etc have less effect if you use them normally (tolerance).
*In general, you  need to stay away  from medical  help until you actually die,
 but there are exceptions to this (that have been pointed out in the text).

                                 COMMON DRUGS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Cyanide (HCN, KCN)

Dosage    : 50 mg Hydrogen Cyanide gas, 200-300 mg Cyanide salts
Time      : seconds for HC, minutes Cs (empty stomach) hours (full s)
Available : very difficult to get hold of
Certainty : very certain
[Notes]
It helps to have an empty stomach (since the salts react with the stomach acids
to form  H.C.). A full  stomach can  delay death  for up to four hours with the
salts. Antidotes to  cyanide poisoning exist, but they have serious side effex.
What you can do, is instead of taking the salts directly, drop 500mg or so into
a  strong acid, and  inhale the fumes. This  will be pure Hydrogen Cyanide, and
you should die in 10 to 20 seconds.
[3]:
"Hydrocyanic acid is one of the most poisonous substances known; the inhalation
 of its fumes in high concentration will cause almost immediate death. Hydrogen
 cyanide  acts  by  preventing  the  normal  process  of  tissue  oxidation and
 paralyzing the respiratory center in  the brain. Most  of the accidental cases
 are due  to inhaling the  fumes during a fumigating process. In the pure state
 it  kills with  great  rapidity. Crystalline  cyanides, such  as  potassium or
 sodium  cyanide  are  equally   poisonous, since   they   interact   with  the
 hydrochloric acid in the stomach to liberate hydrocyanic acid. This poison has
 been  used for  both  homicide  and  suicide; in  recent  history, a number of
 European  political figures carried vials of cyanide salt for emergency  self-
 destruction and some used them. Death resulted from amounts of only a fraction
 of a gram. A concentration of 1 part in 500 of  hydrogen cyanide gas is fatal.
 Allowable  working concentration  in most  of the United States is 20 ppm. Two
 and one-half grains of liquid acid has killed. The  acid acts fatally in about
 15 minutes. The  cyanide  salts  kill  in  several hours. The  average dose of
 solution is 0.1 cc.
[1, DGHS talking about KCN]:
 on an empty stomach, take a small glass of cold tap water. (Not  mineral water
 nor any  sort of  juice  or soda water because of it's acidity). Stir 1 -> 1.5
 grammes of KCN into the water. More than that causes irritation to the throat.
 Wait 5 minutes to dissolve. It should be drunk within several hours.
 Consciousness will be lost in about a minute. Death will  follow 15 -> 45 mins
 later.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)

Dosage    : 20-30+ grammes (too many cause vomitting)
Time      : hours to days, variable
Available : easy to get hold of (get soluble ones, & dissolve them)
Certainty : unreliable
[Notes]
Not recommended, fatal  dose varies  wildly, could cause liver  & kidney damage
instead of death. OD causes strange noises in your ears (like a video arcade) &
projectile vomiting after about 10 hours. Medical help  generally effective, so
stay out of hospital for a couple of days. May cause bleeding in your stomach /
upper  intestines. Take  with  sodium  bicarbinate (eg, bicarb. of soda), which
speeds up the absorbtion (sp?) significantly. Take 1 or 2 antihistermine tabs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Paracetamol (aka acetaminopren / tylenol)

Dosage    : 15+ grammes, 20+ is better
Time      : 10 hours fatal damage, but 2 weeks to actually die
Available : easy to get hold of
Certainty : fairly reliable
[Notes]
Once 10-12 hours  is up, you've had it, but you  still  live for a  week or two
after that. Probably  better to wait 15  hours just to make sure. Horrible side
effects  during  this time (some  of which  are: acute  toxic  hepatitis, renal
failure,  cerebral  oedema,  intra-abdominal  bleeding, aspiration   pneumonia,
haemophilia). Too small dose causes severe liver  damage. Accidental deaths are
very common. There are few if any side effects before the damage becomes fatal;
occasionally vomitting and nausea.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Sleeping tablets (see specific notes for each kind)

* See  later  entries  for  amobarbital,  butabarbital,  diazepam,  flurazepam,
  glutethimide,  chloral  hydrate,   hydromorphone,  meprobamate,  methyprylon,
  meperidine  (pethidine),  methadone,  morphine,  orphenadrine,  phenobarbital
  [also check trade names in same entries].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Alcohol (spirits preferably, your choice)

Dosage    : 1/2 litre vodka?, similar. Varies from person to person.
Time      : about 8 hours
Available : good
Certainty : unreliable
[Notes]
Will cause  liver and  kidney damage if 'rescued' before death. Drink it all at
the same  time, quickly  as possible. Dosage  is questionable, I don't have any
figures. Taking  the spirits  as an enema is supposed to be a very quick way of
absorbing  alcohol, but a less unpleasant  way is to inject  it. The  dosage it
takes to  kill  you depends  on whether  you drink  normally, the state of your
liver, whether you pass out on your back or not.
[3]:
"The fatal  dose of pure alcohol in an average adult is 300-400 mL (750-1000 mL
 of 40% alcohol) if  consumed in  less than one hour. Apart from the effects of
 overdosage, death after  alcohol consumption  can occur as a result of choking
 on vomit while unconscious. .... Consequences such as liver damage occur after
 chronic consumption." Alcohol helps other drugs to dissolve. Don't drink it in
 advance, wash down tablets with it & follow by drinking another few glasses of
 spirits.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Water

Dosage    : 14 litres mentioned
Time      : 12 hours or so?
Available : always available
Certainty : unknown
[Notes]
Works by  washing out  the salts  in your  body, until the cells  fail (osmotic
balance buggered up). You need to keep drinking continually until you collapse.
Unusual method. Someone suggested it would  also cause cramps. The following is
something from >
[2]:
"About a year ago a local newspaper carried a story about a woman who had drunk
 herself to death. Apparently she had injested something  mildly poisonous, and
 when she called her doctor asking him what to do, he told her to drink lots of
 water and see him in the morning. She got  to it and  managed to drink no less
 than 14 litres of water before the osmotic balance in her body was so upset it
 could no longer function and she died (don't know how quickly)".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Bleach and other corrosives (lye, drain cleaning fluids)

Dosage    : A bottle (litre or half litre)
Time      : Hours/days
Available : Easily available
Certainty : Uncertain
[Notes]
Bloody  painful - depends  on your stomach getting  corroded, the stomach acids
escaping, and doing their dirty work in your vital organs.
[1] says:
"I have  heard of  people  throwing  themselves through  plate glass windows in
 their death agonies after drinking lye."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Insulin (injected)

Dosage    : No idea
Time      : death in hours to days
Available : Difficult to get hold of unless you're a diabetic or a vet
Certainty : reasonable
[Notes]
Supposed  to be  quite  pleasant (eg  insulin  shock  treatments  used for some
psychiatric condition).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Petrol (in lungs/injected)

Dosage    : "A Thimble-full" -20 ml?
Time      : Seconds/minutes
Available : Common
Certainty : I'm not sure of the dosage, but fairly certain if correct
[Notes]
Can also use LPG (propane/butane) on skin surface (since these are light enough
to go  through the skin). Stick  your hand  in a bucket  of propane and see how
many seconds you last...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Oil of Wintergreen/Methyl Salicylate (in lungs/injected)

Dosage    : Probably similar to petrol (20 ml)
Time      : Don't know
Available : Not available in concentration
Certainty : Don't know
[Notes]
Don't have enough information on this one to be able to  say anything about it.
If it is just taken normally, it is the same as aspirin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Malathion (insecticide)

Dosage    : A bottle (?)
Time      : 2 to 3 hours
Available : From a large garden centre or DIY shop
Certainty : probable, given correct dosage
[Notes]
Drink undiluted, shake bottle first since it settles. It  causes diarhoea after
about half an hour.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Phosphine gas from aluminium phosphide pesticide (ALP)

Dosage    : Single 3 gramme tablet (".. is enough to kill 10 people")
Time      : About 2 hours
Available : Difficult. Used in India, sold on black market.
Certainty : Without medical help, and using fresh pill, very good
[Notes]
This is  a common  way of  committing  suicide in Indian  villages. There is no
specific  antidote  to this. The  pills  are 3 grammes  of ALP, which  produces
lethal  phosphine gas  when it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid or water
in  the stomach. After  severe  vomiting, the  victim loses  consciousness, the
blood  vessels rupture, and  body  cavities fill  with blood. While the pill is
exceedingly  lethal, some  escape death  because the  rate of  the gas' release
declines with the pill's age and  use, and exposure  to moisture.  Trouble with
this one is the availability, and it also looks like a rather unpleasant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Rat poison (Warfarin)

Dosage    : not known
Time      : Hours to terminal damage, days to actual death
Available : Available
Certainty : Certain given suffient dosage
[Notes]
This  is   one  of  the  truly  unpleasant  poisons, along  with  Paracetamol /
Acetylminopren. I  think it  causes  cerebral  haemorage (rat  poison  works by
giving the unfortunate rat haemophillia). Doctors  can't do  anything about it,
they just leave you to die in agony on an intensive care ward.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Caffeine

Dosage    : 20 grammes (someone said 8 -> 10 grammes)
Time      : not known
Available : Caffeine tablets available in Chemist shops
Certainty : don't know
[Notes]
I don't know  very  much  about  this. There  isn't  all that  much caffeine in
coffee, maybe 200 mg.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Potassium Chloride (injected in solution) / KCl

Dosage    : not known (try 20cc injection of strong solution)
Time      : Seconds to minutes
Available : Widely available
Certainty : Certain given correct dosage
[Notes]
Causes heart attack (which is painful). May be difficult for coroner to realise
it was suicide rather than a natural heart attack. An excess of K+ in the blood
interferes with nerve  signals, and  stops muscles and  nerves from working. So
when it reaches your heart, the heart stops.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Nitrogen gas (or other inert gas)

Dosage    : Several litres uncompressed is minimum
Time      : Minutes
Available : Try plumber, or welding supplies company
Certainty : Certain
[Notes]
This is  really a  form of asphyxiation, (see later), but is  particularly good
since you don't experience the lack of oxygen (what people really experience is
the EXCESS of carbon dioxide).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** ==Helium gas (new addition to list)

Dosage    : Several litres uncompressed is minimum
Time      : Minutes
Available : Try party supply/balloon store. If you cannot obtain a  helium tank
            just buy a few dozen helium filled balloons.
Certainty : Certain
[Notes]
This is  really a form of asphyxiation, (see above Nitrogen gas method), but is
particularly  good since you  don't experience  the lack of oxygen (what people
really experience is the EXCESS of carbon dioxide). Use bag and band over head.
Allow helium to fill bag. Some sleeping pills for a sedative will also help.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Nitrous oxide (N20? NO2?)

Dosage    : Unknown
Time      : Minutes
Available : Dentists supply would be good
Certainty : reasonable
[Notes]
Asphyxiate yourself with laughing gas. Nice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Dosage    : 5% concentration or so?
Time      : Minutes to hours depending on concentration
Available : You get it out  of a car exhaust, you used  to be able to use "town
            gas" (eg, stick  your head  in the  cooker) but  this  is no longer
            available
Certainty : Fairly certain, as long as you aren't "rescued"
[Notes]
Causes brain damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Chlorine gas

Dosage    : not known
Time      : not known
Available : tricky
Certainty : Good
[Notes]
This was used in the first world war in the trenches. Probably very unpleasant,
does something to the lungs.

(Editors note: it works corrosive to the lungs!)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Hydrazine

Dosage    : As produced by reaction
Time      : Not known, fortnight?
Available : Bottle of bleach & bottle of ammonia
Certainty : not known
[Notes] - [2]:
"This is  no joke, D----.  Several  years  ago at  my high  school, one  of the
 janitors innocently mixed together half a bottle of bleach with half  a bottle
 of of ammonia in a small closet where the cleaning fluids were kept. He passed
 out due  to the hydrazine (not  chlorine) gas released in the reaction between
 the  two chemicals. This  man was in agony for two weeks  in an intensive care
 unit in a local hospital with the majority  of the inside surface of his lungs
 damaged and untreatable before he got lucky and died."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Chloroform

Dosage    : not known, just put a splash onto a rag
Time      : several minutes probably
Available : not known
Certainty : good
[Notes]
If you tape the rag over your mouth so that you get knocked out, you should die
as you continue getting the stuff into your lungs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Digitalis (Foxglove, Digitalis Purpurea)

Dosage    : not known
Time      : not known
Available : extract from foxgloves
Certainty : bad due to vomiting
[Notes] - [4]:
Gives you a heartattack. Symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea,
headache, and  slow  irregular  pulse. Also  sometimes  trembling, convulsions,
delirium, and  hallucinations. Its  difficult  to  take a  fatal amount because
vomiting usually gets rid of it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Yew (Taxus Baccata, the "English Yew")

Dosage    : not known
Time      : Can be very rapid (minutes), occasionally 3 or 4 days.
Available : Grows wild in the UK, don't know about elsewhere.
Certainty : not sure, but it sounds good if you eat enough
[Notes] - [4]:
All parts of  the plant, _except_ for the fleshy red bit of  the fruit, contain
poisons. The seeds are poisonous, so if you eat the berries, chew them.
Symptoms: nausea, abdominal  pain, coma, death. The  mode  of  death is a heart
attack which occurs rapidly after eating sufficient. If no heart attack occurs,
you'll  probably  survive. Sometimes  the  sudden  collapse leading to death is
preceded by lethargy, trembling, staggering, coldness, dilation  of the pupils,
rapid pulse that becomes weak, and convulsions. Other species in this genus are
said to be equally poisonous. See "plants in general".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Mezerein, Daphnetoxin (Mezereon, AKA Daphne Mezereum, AKA D. Laureola)

Dosage    : "a few". Probably 10 or more.
Time      : not known
Available : Garden plant. Seeds are particularly poisonous.
Certainty : not known, dosage is questionable.
[Notes] - [4]:
The berries taste horrid, but you only need to eat a few to cause death.
Symptoms:  burning  sensation  in  mouth,   nausea,  vomiting,  stomach  pains,
diarrhoea, weakness, disorientation, convulsions, followed by death. The  seeds
can be dried and stored without affecting the poisons. Don't  confuse this with
laurels in the Prunus genus, Rosacea family. See "plants in general".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Atropine (Atropa Belladonna AKA Deadly Nightshade. Also potato fruits)

Dosage    : 5 berries in young children.. maybe 30 in adults?
Time      : 6 to 24 hours
Available : from fruits of some plants in the potato family.
Certainty : unknown, particularly dosage is questionable
[Notes] - [4]:
AB also contains  hyoscyamine  and hyoscine (scopolamine). Symptoms: dry mouth,
flushed   face,  dilation  of  pupils,  rapid  pulse. Possibly  also  breathing
difficulties, constipation, convulsions, hallucinations, and  coma. AB is often
confused with other Nightshade species, which aren't as  poisonous. The berries
are  black in  AB, and  red in  Woody Nightshade. In  addition, the flowers are
larger  (1.2 in) in  the  true  Deadly  Nightshade. Present  in  unripe  deadly
nightshake fruits, fruits of potato, and fruits of other members of this family
(not tomato though!), but stick with AB. See the "plants in general" entry.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Oleander (Nerium Oleander. Poison similar to digitalis)

Dosage    : not known, but fairly small amounts.
Time      : unknown.
Available : leaves, wood of the plant. From garden centres.
Certainty : unknown.
[Notes] - [4]:
Deaths have  been caused by using wood from this plant in fires, and making tea
from  the  leaves. In  a  few  hours there is abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
bloody  diarrhoea, rapid  pulse,  and  visual  effects. Later,  a  slow,  weak,
irregular  pulse and fall in blood pressure, followed by  failure of heart. See
the "plants in general" entry.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Death-Cap / Destroying-Angel toadstool  (Amanita Phalloides)

Dosage    : Fraction of one can kill, but eat 1 or 2 just in case.
Time      : Week or so
Available : Have to know what it looks like.. similar edible ones
Certainty : Definite without med. treatment; unknown with.
[Notes] - [5, Volume 7, pp591-592]:
"Poisoning by toxic  Amanita species is characterised by a delay  in onset of 4
 to 12 hours. At this  point, nausea  vomiting, colic-like  pain, and diarrhoea
 occur. There then follows a period of respite, which can  last for two to four
 days. This  phase does  NOT signify recovery: damage to the liver  and kidneys
 continues to  develop and  the respite gives way to hepatic and renal failure.
 Death usually occurs a week or so after poisoning.". See "plants in general".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Ricin (Castor oil plant, Ricinus Communis)

Dosage    : death has occured from eating 1 bean, but take more than 10
Time      : within 3 to 5 days
Available : From eating the castor beans
Certainty : depends on ricin content of the beans. Pure ricin is deadly
[Notes] - [2] and [4]:
Symptoms  begin  within  a few  hours with abdominal  pain, vomiting and bloody
diarrhoea for  several days. Decreased  production of urine and a fall in blood
pressure. Note  that  people  have  survived  eating  more than 10 beans, *with
treatment*. Presumably  the  fatal  dose without  medical intervention is less.
Surviving more than 3 to 5 days usually means  recovery. Ricin is  described as
"..one of the most potent toxins known". In 1978 a Bulgarian journalist (Georgi
Markov) was  assassinated  in  London  by being  prodded  with an umbrella. The
umbrella  had a tiny  ball coated  with ricin on its tip, which lodged into the
dissident. He died a few days later in hospital. See "plants in general".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Colchicine (Acetyltrimethylcolchicinic acid, Autumn Crocus, Royal Lily)

Dosage    : 7 mg to 60 mg  (why so wide variation?)
Time      : symptoms in about 4 hours, death in about 4 days
Available : Easily available (from large garden centre)
Certainty : certain
[Notes] - [New Scientist article:]
From the  Autumn crocus (Colchicum Autumnale) / royal  lily (Gloriosa Superba).
One flower of CA is about 12 mg, so take at least five of them. 20g tuber of GS
provides  60mg, single  seed  of CA provides  3.5mg (so take 18). Damages blood
vessels and nerves, and stops cell division. Don't know  whether its painful or
not, but that bit about damaging nerves  is worrying. I just _love_ the name of
the acid! See See the "plants in general" entry.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Aconitine (AKA Wolfsbane, Monkshood, aconitum napellus, a. anglicum)

Dosage    : "a few grams"
Time      : 10 mins to few hours
Available : Garden plant, so get from garden centre
Certainty : unknown (can be treated in hospital)
[Notes] - [2] and [4]:
The poison  is concentrated  in the  unripe seed pods and roots. During winter,
the roots  are particularly poisonous. Symptoms  develop in  less than an hour.
Burning  sensation, feelings  of  coldness, sweating. Later, numbness, vomiting
and diarrhoea with abdominal pain. Finally, slow  pulse, convulsions  and coma.
Death may occur within 2 hours. The  poison kills by causing a cardiac failure,
and it is painful. See the "plants in general" comment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Cicutoxin (Cowbane, Cicuta Virosa)

Dosage    : ".. a few bites .. can cause serious poisoning or death".
Time      : a few hours or more.
Available : rare in most parts of UK, don't know about elsewhere.
Certainty : good, but resembles wild carrot & wild parsnip.
[Notes] - [4]:
The poison  is strongest in the yellow juice of the underground parts. Symptoms
after  half  an  hour: burning  of  mouth, excessive  saliva, flushing, nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, dilation of pupils, and later a bluish tinge  to the skin.
Muscular  contractions  and  convulsions, with  difficulties  in  breathing are
followed by unconsciousness and death, often within  a few hours  of eating the
plant. See "plants in general".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Coniine, Gamma-Coniceine, others (Hemlock, Conium Maculatum)

Dosage    : unknown
Time      : unknown
Available : Grows throughout UK, except north. Don't know about elsewhere.
Certainty : unknown
[Notes] - [4]:
NOTE: There are many plants called "hemlock", some of which aren't poisonous at
all. It can  also be  mistaken  for wild parsley and carrot, and is in the same
family as Cowbane. Symptoms appear in 15 mins to 2 hours. Initially burning and
dryness of the mouth, muscular  weakness leading  to paralysis that affects the
breathing. Sometimes also dilation of pupils, vomiting, diarrhoea, convulsions,
and loss of consciousness. If this is survived, birth defects  may be caused in
pregnant women. This is said to be the plant that Socrates took in 399 BC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Oenanthetoxin (Hemlock Water Dropwort, Oenanthe Eroeata)

Dosage    : "..dangerously poisonous, even in small quantities".
Time      : Two to twelve hours.
Available : Grows in chalky wet areas, particularly S and W Britain.
Certainty : Fairly good, if you get the right species.
[Notes] - [4]:
The tubers  contain more  poison  than the rest  of the  plant, particularly in
winter and early spring, and may be cooked or dried. Symptoms within an hour or
two, nausea,  salivation,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  sweating,  weakness  of legs,
dilation of pupils. Later loss of consciousness with  convulsions before death.
See "plants in general" entry. Same family as Hemlock.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==plants in general (hemlock, foxglove, oleander)

Dosage    : N/A
Time      : N/A
Available : garden centre
Certainty : questionable
[Notes] - [1] says:
"Everything I have ever read about death from plant poisoning indicates that it
 is risky and painful. Symptoms range from nausea and vomiting  to cramping and
 bloody diarrhea. .... .. Altogether, I consider poisonous plants as a means of
 exit far  too unreliable and painful. No  matter how desperate  you are, don't
 even think about it!"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Nicotine (yep - distilled fags!)

Dosage    : extract from 100g tabacco   (possibly 150mg pure)
Time      : not known  (possibly several seconds for 150mg pure)
Available : Easily available
Certainty : not known
[Notes] - [2]:
Soak 100  grammes of tabacco for a few  days. You get a brown  mess. Strain off
the  tabacco, then  simmer slowly  until most of  the liquid has  gone, leaving
about 2 teaspoons of brown treacle-like stuff. Add it to your night-time drink,
and never wake up. Someone said the other day that 150mg of pure nicotine would
be fatal in seconds. See the "plants in general" entry.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Iron (diet suppliments)

Dosage    : unknown
Time      : unknown
Available : diet, health food shops
Certainty : good
[Notes] - [2]:
"Well  it seems  that iron pills achieve death. They oxydize in the stomach and
 eat a hole in it. The only  reason I know  this is that  someone at my  school
 just  recently  OD'd and died  from this. It was ruled suicide since no person
 could accidently take that many iron pills. They  didn't say how many she took
 or how many it takes to kill yourself though." [sounds unpleasant]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==Cocaine

Dosage    : 1 ounce (don't know what that is in real weights..)
Time      : 2 to 3 hours?
Available : Difficult
Certainty : not known
[Notes]
Read  something  in a newspaper... a coke dealer died after  eating an ounce of
it, when the police raided his house. Cause of death was a cardiac arrest 2 1/2
hours after the overdose. However, a cocaine OD is painful, and causes paranoia
& breathing  problems. One  form of  cocaine  smuggling  is to  swallow condoms
filled  with the  stuff. From  time to time, a "mule" has a condom burst inside
him, and dies in pain reasonably quickly.

==LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) nonfatal

Dosage    : infinite!
Time      : never
Available : who cares?
Certainty : will not kill you
[Notes]
LSD can't  kill you by overdose.. you  might go  psychotic  if you  take tens /
hundreds of  thousands of  times the normal  dose, but thats hardly surprising,
since  you'd have  to be insane  to take  that much in the first place. General
warning - even  for normal  use, if you are  depressed, it'll  just amplify the
depression, not  lift it, and  the  chances of  a bad trip are probably higher.
Probably, the  only way to kill yourself with this stuff is to  drop two tonnes
of it on yourself.

poisonous. The  soluble  salts  are, however. The "mad  hatter" story refers to
brain damage that hat makers used to get from using mercury salts.
