       PREVIEW: CANNON FODDER 2{*f0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Atari-conversion by Corpo / Supremacy (now he is a member of Atrocity)
genre   : shot'em'up
players : 1
system  : ST / STE / Falcon 030, TV / RGB-monitor, 1 MB RAM
release : the final release-date isn't known

Hey what! would you say... Yes! It's Cannon Fodder 2, fresh and hot for the ST!
Ok, it wasn't converted by the orignal softwarehouse Sensible Software, but the
guy behind this project is doing a good job and I hope that he will finish this
game sometimes  because it will  be again a brainblasting game for the good old
ST-series...
Ok, after starting the preview I was informed about some technical datas so the
game runs also on the Falcon and more RAM and a harddisk will be supportet.
After a Cannon Fodder 2-pic  a nice  chip-music (surely from  the ST-version of
Cannon Fodder 1) starts to play and you're coming to the briefing-screen of the
first level. Here you can also load and save your games.
I started the game and... it looks  great! Ok, it  seems as the grafix were the
same is in the first part of the game. In the first missions of CF2 you have to
fight in a desert. Ok, the  grafix are  nice, the sound  is good (even if there
are only  chip-tunes and fx) and the control is  the same as in CF1. BUT at one
point this game is a bit crappy... the  scrolling to the right and left is very
slow and the  screen jumps sometimes and so you haven't a right general idea in
this moment and your soldiers were killed by the many enemies.
Your job is always the same, you have to kill all the enemies on the screen and
you must destroy  their buildings. For  this you have the guns for killing your
enemies (they  looking like  mujjahedin or so) and  grenades for  blowing their
houses and temples away. The  killing of your enemies is also a bit bloodier as
in the first part of the game. The blood splashes in masses over the screen...
This  preview contains  a lot of levels, you  have 3 different  missions with 8
different phases.
Ok, that  it and now I'm anxiouly waiting for the final version of the game. It
will be surely a new samsh-hit for the ST. This time I don't know in which form
the game will be released (shareware or so?).
If you had liked  the old original  Cannon Fodder you will love this conversion
from the Amiga... get it!
