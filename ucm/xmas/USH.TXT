Yo guyz! This is da 1st and  surely not  the last article I'm  writin' for this
kewl magazine. This time I've a review of a little but GREAT tool for you.
Ok, you always know which nice thing I mean, the USH!
This great program allows you to crack some loosy protected shareware-tools and
also some commercial ones for ST and also Falcon.
This (a bit older) version  can deprotect  about 44 different things and I will
give you a list with all the stuff you can use now without any limits...

Yo, you see there are some interesting programs in da  list and if you must pay
the registration-fee for every program you have to pay  some hundred DM. So you
can test the tools completely but I will  mention that you should pay the price
if the  program is it  worth in your  eyes because so the  authors will release
perhaps some more things for our machines.
The USH itself is good coded. It's a GEM-program and you can select the program
which you will deprotect in a selector-box. One click and it opens the world of
the complete features for you.
A little hint for using the program much more effective: try to deprotect newer
versions of the listed  software! This  sounds a bit  speculative but it works,
because some of the  programmers don't change the  protections over the several
version-numbers, he, he... As a little example: GEM ViEW 3.16
Teddy has done a good work (with some aditional crax by Ph0enix / Vex) and I'll
hope that there will be some updates of this great software, because  there are
many great tools and also games around  which are  protected by  some l0osy and
disturbing protections  and passwords  but we  must not  rack our heads if guys
like Teddy are working on the good old Atari...
And pleez remember, if you're  using the  deprotected  software all the day and
you like it very much then pay the demanded  regi$tration-fee, even if this fee
is sometimes a bit exaggerated in my eyes.

At  last a  little  message to: Vectronix, Elite, Supremacy, Tumult and all the
others! Keep on hacking guys, because if you will leave  the Atari, this system
will  finally die -> the  most Atarians using  deprotected  software and if the
flow of new releases is trickling away they will go to other systems like Amiga
or PC  where they can  get the newest  releases for an  apple and an egg in the
neighborhood.
