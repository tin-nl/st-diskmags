Neurobotix is a game where  you must jump around in a technical world and fight
against tanks and so one. For this  you controlling  a robot with  many weapons
like guns, grenades  and so one. There isn't a big meaning behind the game like
in all the other games, the only thing you have to do is all to destroy (or not
because you must not kill all the enemies to finish the single levels, you must
only reach the teleporters).
Ok, after this old-fashioned plot I'll take a look to the technics...
Hum, the grafix are a bit colourless for a Falcon-game, even if the author says
that the game uses 256 colors. The whole screen is in grey colours and the only
things which loosing up the monotone scenario are the explosions and the yellow
teleport-zones. Your sprite is  very big  but only a  little bit  animated. For
such bit sprites it isn't  enough! It looks  very static... the enemies  aren't
animated. The driving  or flying around without any animation and this is  very
boring. The best on the grafix are the explosions.
The sound  are some samples in the game itself and a simple tracker-tune in the
intro, thats all.
The control of your sprite is a bit tricky but nothing more.
The game  offers also a save-mode  where you can save the stages which you have
completed and so you must not start in the lamerlevel everytime. But for me the
motivation was lost after the 10th try to destroy one of the damn tanks because
everytime I  died. Eventually I hadn't the right weapons to  kill them but that
the game resets the computer after dying is very shitty... I think it's a crude
thing to force the player with this "feature" to pay the registration-fee...
Ok, what  should I say. Games of this  kind are very  seldom on  the Falcon but
this  one isn't state of  the art I think. I can only say  that you should wait
for other releases  before paying the registration-fee, even if 5 pounds aren't
much money.
