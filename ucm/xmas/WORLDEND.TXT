   "World Without End" by De/Vision{*f0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by : Strange Ways Records 1993/94
price       : about 35 DM

Yup! I've bought  again a De/Vision-album. This time I haven't tested it in the
record-shop and... it's again great!  It's the first album of the band and here
you can hear which bands are the models  of De/Visions  style. It is  obviously
that they are working under the influence  of Depeche Mode, New Order  and also
Camouflage and some other synthie-pop-bands and I  like this mixture very much,
because it doesn't sound like a lame rip-off... The songs are mainly a bit more
depressive and slowly in the sound, the voice of the singer and the instruments
and so you  can sit down and hear  to the songs, its definitive nothing to jump
around... only great calm synthie-ballads...

Ok, here coming the contents

01. Dinner Without Grace
02. Your Hands On My Skin
03. Slum Child
04. Perfect Mind
05. Time Stands Still (Tonight)
06. The Way You Treat Me
07. To Be With You
08. Falling
09. The Day Before Yesterday
10. Try To Forget

What should  I say? Buy it! It's  worth the money and it isn't the usual disco-
crap you'll hear everytime in the radio, disco or on TV...

And last but not least the song-texts...

DINNER WITHOUT GRACE
--------------------

Immaculation in your eyes
Depravity within your mind
A suffer from a devotional alliance
Purity is in your smile
A lack of confidence beneath your shine
Another heavenly defiance.

They're telling you lies
Privation within their rhymes
Don't wait for god's embrace
Let's have a dinner without grace
They're telling you lies
Deceit is in their mind
It's time that in god's face
We have a dinner without grace.

Morality will fall apart
A greater scheme deep in your heart
No time for innocence and pride
Sincerity you have to prove
Dissimulation is too close to truth
Don't mind your chastity tonight.

They're telling you lies...

YOUR HANDS ON MY SKIN
---------------------

Only you know my perverted dreams
You know what I feel
You know what I really want
You are the only one
I could prefer to touch you now
But I only want to know
One thing at this point.

Please tell me
Why I belong to you
When I cry
When I cry
For your hands on my skin.

Save the only thing you can
Tell me what it is
Don't try to hide the perfect mess
Of your strange behaviour.

Please tell me...

SLUM CHILD
----------

Your painful eyes
Tell the storie of your life
About everything you need
About something you forget.

The silence never heard
The pleasure never felt
And the tears they're falling down
And the fear it comes again.

You're behind the times
You believe in God alone
I know his little ways
Don't listen to the voice
Let him alone.

And the slum child looks around
Tries to escape and goes...
And the slum child looks around
Tries to escape and goes
To the place he needs
And don't forget the words I said to you.

And your tears are falling down
Tries to escape and goes
And the fear it comes again
Tries to escape and goes
To the place he needs
And don't forget the words I said to youi
I said to you

And your tears are falling down
Tries to escape and goes...
And the fear it comes again
Tries to escape and goes...

PERFECT MIND
------------

Now that the lights are out
I am in bed
And cannot sleep
I think about
The time we live in
The feeling is so deep in me
It burns in my mind
It burns in my mind.

And when I see
Whats going on there
I hide myself
I cannot understand
This hate in dreamland.

Their faces look the same
And we are all to blame
But we're too stupid to understand it
What a shame.

And When I see...

TIME STANDS STILL (TONIGHT)
---------------------------

You lie by my side
I touch your skin
Love at first sight
The time stands still
I give you a kiss
Don't let me go
The last four days
I missed you so.

You see tears in my eyes
Should I cry or should I smile
You bleong to me
Time stands still
Tonight.

With all my heart
I stare at you
You smile at me sweetly
I come back to you
Such is life
It's strange to say
The time flies by
What can I do.

You see tears in my eyes
Should I cry or should I smile
You beling to me
Time stands still
Tonight.

Tonight
Tonight
The time stands still
Tonight.

You
You lie by my side
I touch your skin
Love at first sight
The time stands still.

THE WAY YOU TREAT ME
--------------------

I'm alone
I try to understand why you go
Please take me in your arms tonight
To hear your breath
And hold me tight.

And I go
To the place I should ignore
Believe me
Please
And come once more
To touch your breast
In the dark night.

My latent dreams
I wish you were here
I feel the heat
In my hands again.

The time had come
The game began
I payed for love
And we had fun
The night was long
Her face so bright
Her voice so strong
She holds me tight.

You say
You'll never leave me
You say
You'll always need me
And the way you treat me
Is acceptable.

TO BE WITH YOU
--------------

To be with you
To be with you again
Don't show your tears
We know this is the end
When I was young
I looked into your eyes
When I was young
I saw that you were mine.

To be with you
To be my girl again
The time has come
No future in my hands
When I want love
You see it in my eyes
When you want more
I can see it in your smile.

What `m waiting for
Is to be with you
To be with you again
What I'm waiting for
Is to be with you
Again.

FALLING
-------

Since the day I met you
Since my prayers reached you
I know thyt you're the only one.

And I'll never curse you
All the lows I've been through
Make me sure that I have won.

When I look into your eyes
I can always see them smile
When I listen to your words
And I feel they do not hurt
I always want to be the one
To talk you and have fun.

Falling
Falling
Falling
In love with you.

Then you take my hand
Lad me to your land
Let me feel your charme
Hold me in your arms
Well I can't escape
And I feel no hate
I suppose I do
Things you want me to.

Time is running fast
Leaves me in the past
Poison in my vains
Makes me squirm with pain
Can't you safe me now
Though I don't know how
Can't you make me feel
All my wounds you heal.

Falling
Falling
Falling
In love wih you.

When I look into your eyes...

TRY TO FORGET
-------------

You
You return in the night
Don't have a person to hold you
And you think about the past time
When you were
When you were still loved.

You go to bed alone
Don't have a person to warm you
And you think about your lost love
The you try to forget.

Try to forget, try to forget
Try to forget
You should try to forget
But you can't forget.

You
You don't show your tears but I do
And you hope that someone knows
That you are alone
And takes you
And takes you in his arms.

Your secrets are your thoughts
Write them down and start to cry
Write them down and start to scream
Because you know you are alone.

Try to forget
Try to forget, but you can't forget...
