       XMAS 1996 SPECIAL ISSUE{*f0


Hello and welcome to this unregular issue of Undercover!

Because I've  received many interesting textfiles in the  last weeks  I had the
idea to release a little issue for Xmas, just to entertain you on the holidays.
Today (16.12.96) the  regular issue 7 isn't  released. I don't know why. Drizzt
is working since some weeks on it and I don't know what he  is doing. I hope to
get the sources  in time  to release this  issue to the planed date... this are
only 4 days! FUCK!
This mag  isn't right counted  in the Undercover series because we had only one
month to realize this project.
This time you'll found not to many informations about our computers in here. We
have more  other stuff  like several idiotic  Xmas-stories (sorry, only for the
german readers), some great  fantasy-tales  and some  other things. This  shows
that  we will  entertain  you over  the Xmas-days  with other  things as boring
computerstuff. And please remember, the scene isn't active enough for releasing
the mag every month. It's sad, I know, but what will we do?
Sometimes I'm looking a bit envious to the Amiga 1200. Ok, there are coming not
many games out for this machine, but there are great graphic-tools around (like
Personal Paint or so one) and the scene is extremely  alive. Every month coming
new demos, intros and  mags (!) and this  productions have a never seen quality
in my eyes. There  are some magazines  around which inform ONLY about the scene
itself with party-reviews and news. They must not fill up there issues with the
reviews  of demos, tools and games or craptalk. Hum... When you have the chance
just  take a  look at  the mag  SeenPoint or Generation... Cool mags with great
dsign and informative contents...
Another  problem  is that  also the  mailbox-scene for the Atari is going down,
especially the Elite-boards are dying out. Also if you're searching for a demo-
board you  will not find  many boards  anymore. What's going on on this fucking
system? For every new board are dying about three or four others!
And other problems coming up: at the InterCon Autumn were the first information
about the big Easter-party, called SILICONVENTION 97 spread (take a look to the
scene-corner for the  invitation-file). This party will be  the follower of the
cool Fried Bits-parties... Hum, thats very good, BUT also the parallel party in
Hamburg, the Symposium/Mekka  will be open  for the Atari-scene, Avena were co-
organizers at this party. This is extremely shit in my eyes, because the little
Atari-scene will be splitted up because of this! We will go to the SILICON '97,
because we will meet known peoples there. The other party will surely much much
bigger, because it's mainly a party for  Amiga and PC and so you'll find in the
thousands of peoples no one you knew. Please remember to the Symposium '96. The
Atari-scene  was put in  an extra-room (on quarantine in my eyes :-( and it was
narrow  and stuffy! And please remember to the  competition-prices! Only Amiga-
stuff! What will you do with an Amiga-turboboard and your Falcon?! NEVER AGAIN!
Ok, I will not write anymore about this. I will only say, if you're cool enough
then come to the SILICON!
Hum, the scene...  we have  taken also a  look to the  activities of the scene,
even if there weren't  activities we should  mention here. We have some results
of parties which were held in this year and some little informations.
We have also some little software-reviews but don't expect to much...
I wouldn't  tell  some more bullshit  here, just lean back and read this issue!
More  scene- and computer-related  stuff we will  bring you with issue 8, which
will be out around the SiliConvention, at Easter 1997.
And now I and the other  tnb-guys and  Undercover writers  will wish  you all a
Merry Xmas and a happy New Year!
