-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, there are some more mags around for the ST. I've received  now some things
which  were released this  year and so I'll  take a look at them and  show you,
what is left after "ST News" quit the ST...

          ST WORLD - ISSUE 5{*f0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released  : 11.06.1996
publisher : Sion Dovey / Shadow of Effect / UK
disx      : 1

Ok, this issue comes along with an intro which is very lame... It contains only
ripped grafix (from Substation) and old musix... Awful!
Good, I wouldn't judge a magazine after the intro and so I loaded the shell and
haaargl... Only an ASCII-screen! You can  scroll the mainpage up and down and a
bar shows which article you can  load. There aren't any grafix in it and only a
very old chip-tune was played. Hum... The viewer isn't  much better. On the low
border you can  see some buttons  like Help, Esc and  Options but there isn't a
mouse-routine implemented, BUT if you move the mouse you're jumping back to the
mainmenu...
Ok, I will  go over to the contents. You can read  something  about coding, PD-
games and compacts, comercial games (older ones) and some more. About the scene
in general  is nothing to find  in the magazine. Also the most things  the guys
behind the mag writing about are outdated and in my opinion total uninteresting
because  no one needs  again the complete ST-cheatslist (it was  released about
thousand times before) or informations  about Rainbow TOS (1.4). Also some info
about the "super console" Jaguar were in  this issue and I think they have this
stuff included to blow up the contents. There are only about 60 articles in the
magazine (with only 260 KB packed). Ok there is some more stuff on the disk but
only useless things like an Invitation maker or an old picture-ripper.
All in one this magazine is absolutely outdated and boring. Only the reviews of
some more or less lame UK-compact disx were worth a look...
I know, it  isn't easy today  to create a new magazine  but I think if you WILL
release a good magazine you will match it in any way...
I'll hope they will develop their shell and viewer much more and hopefully they
will receive more help from other writers. If not than good night!

       TOXIC MAGAZINE - ISSUE 12{*f0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released  : 12.09.1996
publisher : Toxic Team (No Limit Coding / Sector One) / France

The  Toxic Magazine is  one of the oldest ST-diskmags  which has survived up to
now. In former times many different groups have worked on this mag like the ICS
or The Storm Brothers. In the  last years the  mag goes over to the last french
ST-fanatics around Sector One.
This issue should be out on the GigaFun '96 but they haven't matched it to this
date and so it comes about one month to late. Because some former issues I have
I was very anxious about this issue. Now I have it here and I'll review it fast
for you.
Ok, I put the disk into my good old ST and switched the computer on... Hum. The
intro  wasn't state of  the art, or  better, it was  big shit! I've seen better
stuff by  Sector One in former times! Only some  text-pages, cruel grafix and a
gurgeling tracker-tune (from the Union Demo)... lame...
After this a second  intro comes up, this  time by No Limit Coding and Typhoon.
It isn't much  better. The grafix  aren't blockbusters, there is  a nice Lotus-
tune and after some french text I was smashed to the desktop...
After this  I wished back  the good  old times... and they're  coming back! The
mag-shell is  still one of  the nicest on  the ST. The  mainmenu is easy to use
with  the mouse and  contains also  pictures in the text. All the other options
can be taken in the viewer itself. But there are two things I don't like on the
whole magazine... it doesn't contain scrolling and it's written in FRENCH!!!
Harf! Ok, because  I had this language  for some years in the school I can read
some of the texts but it's very hard (I haven't spoken french since about seven
years...). You can  read something about the french scene (which is very active
also on the ST), the latest  parties, demo-reviews, interviews with scene-guys,
news about hardware (Centurbo board for the Falcon) and much  more. On the disk
you can find some goodies like little games, demos and tools.
Ok, what should I say about  this magazine. If  you're able to  understand this
strange language  you can read many interesting things in this magazine and you
should get it. If you can't speak  only one french word (not even "merde") than
get your hands of this thing.
I for my own  hope that they  will continue their  work on the ST because there
aren't many mags left for this machine. The only thing I wish is that they will
write also some english  articles because  there are some more guys left in the
scene which aren't frenchies...
