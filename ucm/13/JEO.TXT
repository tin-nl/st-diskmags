 Some  of  you surely  heard about  the  great "Atari Explorer Online" magazine
 spreaded as a BIG *.txt file. It was one  of the coolest  news-sources for all 
 Atarians beginning from 8-bit Atari up to TT and Falcon owners. For people who
 didn't saw it yet the words like "magazine in *.txt file" seems to be so funny 
 I believe, but hey, you are so wrong. I would like to say  that AEO was one of 
 the MOST professional Atari magazines. The contents of the AEO were great, you 
 could see that this mag was edited by -REAL- Atari fanatics.
 The most important  thing was that AEO was absoluety for free! Guys  from such
 commercial  magazines like "ST Format" would be -ONLY ASHAMED- because AEO was
 much more interesting to read! (e.g. included more news from Atari world). And
 do not forget AEO was absolutely for free! :))

 Unfortunately  AEO "died". Wouldn't be worse I thought. However a big surprise
 happend to  me later. I was  watching the DHS www page someday and I found the
 link to  AEO there. I  thought: "oh gosh, evl didn't  update this  section for
 ages". Anyway I decided to see if AEO link still worked.
 I clicked on the "Atari Explorer Online" and... hey? It was still there! I was
 so happy to see it and I was  going to download  the AEO issues which I didn't
 got yet. But hey! The  big great "Jaguar Explorer Online"  logo appeard on the
 screen! So the AEO guys decided to make a Jaguar magazine instead? Excellent! 

 The first issue  of JEO saw the light of day last year, the year which - to be
 honest -  wasn't the best for Jaguar. Some people thought: JEO is great but it
 is the last issue I believe. There will be nothing to report in the next issue
 because Jaguar releases shrinked to zero and JEO will just die.

 However these guys were so wrong! JEO is still here and contains a lot of nice
 informations from the still kickin' Jaguar world. 

 So what we can find in the latest issue? Here it comes...

 [-] New Cheats and Codes to the following games:      
      
     - Blue Lightning
     - Breakout 2000
     - Fight For Life
     - Kasumi Ninja
     - SuperCross 3D
     - Worms 
     - Zero 5 

 comments: It's unbelievable but right after the "Worms" release (May'98) these 
           guys already included the cheats to it! GREAT!
 
 [-] CyberChatter - Random topics about the Jaguar compiled from on-line public
                    discussion areas. 
 
 It's  one of the most  interesting  places in JEO!  For example - did you hear
 that "...atari  was building  an interface board  and cartridge setup  for the 
 Jaguar"?  And do you  know that  "The interface board  could use  standard  PC
 keyboards and  Mice and external  modems"? Sounds great, eh?! You just have to  
 read it!!

 [-] BattleSphere 

 Here  you can find some  news about the new promising game for Jaguar which is 
 very close to release now!   

 [-] Llatest from Llamaland

 Like the guys from JEO say: "check it out, and see what else Jeff  has  yakked
 up lately". Nothing more to add... 

 [-] VoiceModem

 Here you can find  the bunch of e-mail addresses to lucky  "Jaguar VoiceModem" 
 users. Guys of JEO also reveal "there's less than 100 of these gems!!". Anyway
 it's really nice to know it was finally released!
 
 [-] The Two Cybermorphs

 Breaking news! Did you heard that there are TWO versions of Cybermorph??! Yep, 
 this isn't joke! JEO guys  heard this rumour  and decided to ask  Fred Gill of 
 Attention  to  Detail. JEO contacted  Fred Gill, and he had this to say: "yes, 
 there are two versions!". Another article which you HAVE TO READ!!

 [-] JagFest '98

 It's an invitation for another edition of the american Jaguar event! The words
 like "Apparently it went well enough that the organizers have decided to do it 
 again this year", sounds really nice :))

  Sounds cool, eh?? 

 [-] Alastair Lindsay Interview  
      
 Here  you  will find  very interesting  interview with  Alastair Lindsay  from 
 Imagitec Design, "creators of some of the best tunes on the Jaguar, if not the 
 best games". 

 [-] Worms review
 
 Jaguar owners had to wait about 2 years for the Worms and JEO guys reported if 
 it was worth waiting for. Very good and precise review!  
  
 [-] Big Code Hunting

 Clay Halliwell heard about the  "unrevelved" Kasumi Ninja codes and decided to 
 ask about it the authors of the game. The  producer from APD (Accolade Product 
 Development) answered:

 "I will have to look around and see if I still have the codes. They are not in
 the forefront of my mind these days. I'll see what I can do...". 

 However one of the author found the codes and sent them to Clay. You will find 
 them in this issue of JEO.
 
 Of course that's not everything what you can find in JEO. Except this you will
 find "Jaguar titles  in development  or limbo", "Current Software Releases" or
 "Current Hardware Releases".
 JEO is a great source of news, interesting interviews, game reviews,  hardware
 tests etc. If you are a Jaguar user then YOU HAVE to read this magazine!
