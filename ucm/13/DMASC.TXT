                      INTERVIEW WITH: DMA SC/SECTOR ONE

================================================================================


ÛI. General Questions :



UCM:     First tell us a little bit of your history. How did you start computing
         and what groups you were in?

ÚDMA SC:  I started computing  when my  father got a  1040 ST from  his job. They
Ú         were using Atari and Amiga only! I was a 9 years old child ... I played
Ú         Buggy Boy  8 hours  a day. Then  when I  was 15  I get  interrested  in
Ú         computer  music (I  was  discovering  the  Protracker). So I  began  to
Ú         compose craps ...
Ú         In 1995, I entered a group called NoTeC. There were 2 coders with great
Ú         ideas  and the  abilities to code  great stuffs, but  unfortunately  no
Ú         prods have been released, all  unfinished. In 1996, ST Ghost invited me
Ú         to join  Sector One  and so I reach  today and I'm allways in this cool
Ú         group!


UCM:     What are your jobs in the group?

ÚDMA SC:  I'm the musician as you guessed it! 8-) And Webmaster (eh eh!), in fact
Ú         I'm coding  and upgrading  the Sector One HomePage. See at  the end for
Ú         the URL.


UCM:     The crowd may be bored of this one but who cares? How old are you?

ÚDMA SC:  I'm  19 years old ... And  I'm on  2nd year of  Computing IUT (it's the
Ú         university).


UCM:     What is your current equipment?

ÚDMA SC:  I've got a  Mega STe  with 2 Megs (with  no HD ... arf  chrashed) and a
Ú         520 STe with 1 Meg for the ATARI machines.
Ú         I also got  a 200 Mhz Pentium, a Playstation  and a  TI 82 (hey  it's a
Ú         great calc, now ASM progs ... oups, games are availables! 8-).


UCM:     What is your fave game for the ST/FALCON?

ÚDMA SC:  I think  it's Turrican 2 (but also  Wings of Death, Obsession, Stardust
Ú         and some others ST games are great) on ST.

Ú         I don't have a Falcon 8-( but the best  game I've seen on  this machine
Ú         is Running.


UCM:     What is your fave demo for ST/FALCON?

ÚDMA SC:  The Braindamage (great design) is the  best one I've seen on STe but on
Ú         ST it's the Flipo.

Ú         On Falcon I don't have seen enough demos to form an opinion about them.


UCM:     What interests do you have apart from computing?
         Fave music for example.

ÚDMA SC:  I like  various  styles  of musics (as  every musician  should!) and my
Ú         favorites are Techno (especially Jungle and Trance), Rap, Funk and Acid
Ú         Jazz, Progressive  Rock (and only Progressive!), Japanese  music, Video
Ú         Games musics and all Synthetic and Electronic musics (ChIpS RuLeZ! 8-).

Ú         I also enjoy Mangas and some points of the Japanese culture.

Ú         I  like  design  in  general (techno,  numeric, architectural, cars  or
Ú         anything else).

Ú         And ---------------------------------> DeLiRiUm RuLeZ! YEAH!!



UCM:     Please tell us your point of view about the future of the Atari-scene.

ÚDMA SC:  Mhhhhhhhhhh ... Toh! In fact there are  always many groups  alive since
Ú         the falling off (1993/1994) but  only few of them  makes prods  and the
Ú         demos contain less and less hard code ... especially on ST of course!
Ú         Because on  Falcon the code is still great (with the 680XX and the DSP)
Ú         ...

Ú         I think there won't be a big resurrection (expecting the one from Jace!
Ú         8-) but cool releases will allways get out and that will keep the scene
Ú         alive, at least.



ÛII. Going Deeper (Underground!!!!! 8-)



UCM:     What is your  group doing now? Projects? What's up with  Mr. Boomer for
         example?

ÚDMA SC:  Mr. Boomer  isn't finished  yet (some  cool  features  are  added  like
Ú         bosses) and Exyl is allways working  on it, he also  tries to code more
Ú         on ASM. EdO (the Gfx-man) got works on his projects with Exyl and he is
Ú         doing GFX for others crews ...
Ú         ST Ghost  and Hello  are always  working on  new multimedia  and  other
Ú         utilities (or new versions like DBE Tracker and AVI Player) ...

Ú         Check out our conversion of Pie Bill Gates, available soon!


UCM:     Which tracker  programs do you use and which  do you think is  the best
         tracker around on Atari machines (chip and mods)?

ÚDMA SC:  As I don't own  a Falcon, I mainly use FastTracker 2 on PC (the quality
Ú         of  the sound is  better than on my STe ...) and  ProTracker 2 and  DBE
Ú         Tracker to check if it runs good on STe!


UCM:     Who is your fave chipmusician (on Atari and in general)?

ÚDMA SC:  On ATARI I think  the best are  Mad Max, Tao and Scavenger. I also like
Ú         505, Jess and other guys work.

Ú         On C64  and Amiga  the best  one is  Chris Huelsbeck!! But  Tim Follin,
Ú         Maniacs of Noise and Rob Hubbard are also Masters!


UCM:     Speaking about musicians who is your fave mod-musician?

ÚDMA SC:  My fave mod-musicians are Nuke, Jogeir, Moby, Maniacs of Noise and Five
Ú         Musicians but there  are too much great composers to listen'em all (and
Ú         remembering them all ...!).

Ú         I really like  covers of  old tunes (like C64  game-musics, just  now I
Ú         listen  to the  cover of  Last Ninja Remix  by  Wire  and  it's  sooooo
Ú         wonderful!! But I arranged it to match more the original melody ...).


UCM:     Have you any fave chipmusic or module?

ÚDMA SC:  I really love these games soundchips:

Ú           - Castlevania (Nintendo)
Ú           - Chambers of Shaolins
Ú           - Comic Bakery Tune 3 (IN DA FACE !!!!!! 8-)
Ú           - Cybernoid 1 & 2
Ú           - Eliminator
Ú           - Ghouls'n Goblins
Ú           - Ghouls'n Ghosts
Ú           - Giana Sisters
Ú           - Last Ninja
Ú           - Lethal Xcess
Ú           - Megaman (Nintendo)
Ú           - Mongolia (In Ooh Crikey ...)
Ú           - Monty 1 & 2
Ú           - Rings of Medusa 1 & 2
Ú           - Scavenger Tunes
Ú           - Turrican 1, 2 & 3
Ú           - Turbo Outrun
Ú           - Wings of Death

Ú           There are others soundchips I like but all the the list above are the
Ú           one I loooooove, the  Creme de la Creme (why  transcribe  a  so weird
Ú           expression from french? There  are some  others which are much better
Ú           like: "Faut trop  etre a fond dedans!" or "Ca pete  trop net batard!"
Ú           8-D)!

Ú           In modules ... there  are a lot I love but it  varies when I hear new
Ú           ones ... (I know  Gryzor, the  guy  who  created  the  Mods-Anthology
Ú           compilation so ... I allways get the last modules 8-) But the ones by
Ú           the musicians I listed in the fave composers sections are wonderful.


UCM:     Are you using synthesizers as sample sources for your mods? Do you also
         create music using synths?

ÚDMA SC:  Not at all as I don't have ones and I don't have the possiblity to have
Ú         access to any ... 8-(  My  samples-sources  are  various but  it's more
Ú         samples-rippin' from  other modules ... But not the melodies!!! Because
Ú         I heard  some modules  where I  reconize some  samples  used in  others
Ú         modules and ... the melody  was also the  same!! These ones  are LAMERS
Ú         cos they  don't release  it as a cover, an arranged version  or a remix
Ú         but as a composition of there own.


UCM:     Timewarp. You are a child again and you are supposed to buy a computer.
         Would you choose Atari again?

ÚDMA SC:  Yeah! ... Or perhaps Amiga ... because in  the past  they use  to be in
Ú         competition, but  I choose  Atari and I  don't regret  that, cos  we're
Ú         always alive!! (on ST as I compare it to the 500)


UCM:     What was the best experience you made during your activity in the Atari
         demoscene?

ÚDMA SC:  WoW! Very difficult to answer... I don't really know, perhaps the first
Ú         time when someone told me that my music was good! 8-)
Ú         Arf, when I listen to these old shits, IT WASN'T GOOD AT ALL! 8-D
Ú         In fact, I've got a "problem", because when I compose  a music I think:
Ú         "Yeah that's great !", but when I listen to it 2 months later  I think:
Ú         "In fact it could have been better...", but that  forces me  to compose
Ú         more and more !



ÛIII. Brainstorming



UCM:     Please give us a short comment on following topics.


ATARI         -Ú I love it and I'm not about to stop it!

AMIGA         -Ú If the STe would have been fully exploited and the design better
               Ú the  results on  ATARI  could  have been  as great  as on  these
               Ú machines!! (I always speak comparing the STe to the 500)

PC & MS       -Ú PC: It's the standard now ... but revolving too fast!!

                Ú    to do things! 8-D

DEMOS         -Ú The best way to  show computers features and coders, GFX-men and
