  óIllness at night and shackled sheepð - òEscapeð [QuaST Party release] (ñFalconð)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No of Escape  seems to be the most active german in the Atari scene today. After
releasing a good 4ktro at the InterJam, NO strikes once again on the QuaST Party
and releases a short demo.
I'm a bit torn  to call it  a megademo. Scrictly spoken, it is rather small, but
it features too many effects to call it an intro.

The demo starts  with an Escape logo which is slowly being faded on the screen -
diagonally, and is also being textured very smoothly. Not bad for a start.
After that, NO tells us  that we may call him either inproductive  or some other
names, but that we never deal with reality that way.
These messages  are presented  as text on the middle of the screen in front of a
nice  background, surrounded by NO's dot  routines. Well, these lines  are being
interrupted by other effects, and everywhere NO's dot routines shine through.

After  that,  music  changes  and  we  are  being  confronted  with  a  kind  of
kaleidoscope  effect - But in truecolour. NO  already  did something  similar in
Sili Con Carne, this time, it behaves a bit different.
This  effect  however  doesn't  stay  too  long and is  being replaced  by a B/W
photography of an  extremely fat woman. This photo is being "waved" a little and
the  motion  is being  blurred. The  colour  changes  and  the  woman  is  being
"dematerialised" using NO's dots again.
A kind of Falcon like Starfield with LOTS and LOTS of different coloured dots is
being brought on the screen and move around rapidly.
The demo displays the credits and the demo ends.

Well, as you might have seen above, "Illness at Night and shackled sheep" is too
long for an intro but on the other hand too short for a demo.
The effects are being presented very well. The main effect of the demo surely is
the  dot routine  NO uses  quite often, even  to  create  effects which  are not
typically  done by dot effects. However, the design is good and  all the effects
are presented nicely.
The music is  a bit mixed but I guess  typical for 505, No's little brother. The
style of the three tunes differ ghastly. The intro tune  is quite good  and fits
the text on the screen  and the effects  very well, the tune being played during
the kaleido-effect is a bit quiet but features the standard ST keyboard click as
a sample - Excellent idea.
The last  tune seems  to have  its origin  on a Sepultura-album ... At  least it
sounds like this.

Well ... So how would I judge this demo?
I think this demo is good. It is a bit short, but it is a different kind of demo
as it  doesn't feature  lots of 3D  effects or  mapping effects, yes, it doesn't
even feature a tunnel.
Because  of this, I say this demo stands  out of the  crowd. A good  demo, but a
little short.
