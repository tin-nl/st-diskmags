                           THE CZECH ATARI SCENE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides Poland  there are a lot  other countries  from the eastern  Europe where
you can find  Atarians and in  the present state of shrinking of  the "old Atari
world" it's time to discover new areas, new freax, new friends.

Unfortunately it seems  as we have  discovered the czech  Atari scene a bit late
because also there the Atari scene has passed the zenith.
There are still a lot of  people left  but also  a lot of them  is already gone,
and this also years ago.

I will start with a small history of the czech scene...

Very interesting to know is that there was a small local games  market with some
games we have never heard of here in Germany or other "old" countries.
At next comes a small  list of  games which were produced in  the Czech Republic
within the last years and released as commercial.
GRAVON - the only Falcon game so far, a hover simulation, made by SUMA in 1995
HLAVA KASANDRY - it was a sci-fi adventure by LET DISK, released in 1993
HLIPA - this was 3d isometric adventure, made by KASUHA SOFTWARE back in 1992
INVAZE Z ALDEBERANU - was a Space Invaders clone, made by SUMA
KLETBA JIZNI ZEME - it was a gfx/txt adventure by DRACONIX
NOID 4 - an Arkanoid clone by ROBERT CIMRMAN, made in 1994
POWER UP - a 2D racing game by HEADACHE PROJECT, done in 1996
TETRIS 2 STRIKES BACK - another Tetris clone by BEAST SOFTWARE

Maybe you think  it isn't much, but very interesting  indeed! Except  the latest
games  like "POWER UP" or "TETRIS 2 STRIKES BACK" I don't  know if  the stuff is
still available there.

On the demo front there were some actions too...

CZEX was the most famous  demo group. This band was known  as MORPOHOSE CREW too
and  did  several  demos, like "LAMEMANIA" and  the "UNITY DEMO". TRAUMA, one of
the members, has taken part in the "TRIBUTE TO FRANZ KAFKA" demo too.
The latest  demo was released  on the DEMOBIT'95 (just  like "TRIBUTE TO KAFKA")
too, called "FANTA MORGANA".
Today they're working on PC...

SEDMA... aarg! He  is a slovakian coder but I will  mention him here because the
slovakian scene is maybe much smaller than the czech and he released  some stuff
on the DEMOBIT'95 too, this was a czech/slovakian party.
His first release (I think so...) was "BLITTERMANIA" a demo for ST. The  perhaps
last one was released on the party mentioned above and called "TEN YEARS OF ST".
Since this time nothing more is known, at least to me.

A bit strange is the thing with the slovakian  team SATANTRONIC. I don't know if
they were active really or just a fake band. Anyway I heard that there are a lot
more actions  in Slovakia too and that there was also  an Atari club  located in
Bratislava.

Other teams, working on games and so on, who disappeared too in the  last years,
will follow now...

SUMA SOFTWARE was the  label of the SPANEL brothers. They released several stuff
for ST and Falcon  too. One was "INVAZE Z ALDEBERANU", than the wellknown hover-
craft  simulation "GRAVON" for Falcon and last but not least "COMPONIUM" a music
program. Unfortunately  they joined the  wrong side and working  on a commercial
PC game now.

DRACONIX was the  next team  on the games  sector. They released  a game  called
"KLETBA JIZNI ZEME" (a grafix/text adventure) and translated the  manual  of the
old "ISHAR 1" to czech language.

BEAST SOFTWARE, responsible for the "TETRIS 2 COMES BACK" game back in 1995 left
the Atari scene before finishing their second big project, a RPG game.

ORTHODOX SOFTWARE, the  former (?!) team of PETR STEHLIK released  several games
in the  early  nineties, just like a "LEONID", a  Tetris clone  or "DST" a  very
strange  czech text/grafix adventure. After the split of the  team (around 1997)
all their releases were spread as freeware.

And if you have some game producers the crackers aren't far away!
Yep, there were  several crackers active in the local czech scene, just like the
PRAGUE ST ALLIANCE, ORION SOFTWARE or DATADECK.

Last but  not least I think it's important to  say that even in  1996 at least 5
czech boards were located in the Czech Republic, just like the JOY BBS, SAY BBS,
ATOS BBS, RST BBS and the CalamuSTation BBS.
Unfortunately I don't know if this boards have survived till today.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...THE PRESENT SITUATION...

In the  Czech Republic  we have today several coding  teams around, but there is
no real local demo scene there, just like in Poland. The most of them working on
more  or less  semi-professional tools and  utilities. A  round-up of  the still
active scene will follow at the end...

Besides them there  are also many  Atarians around, just like the  normal users,
making music with the machine or playing games... old games.

There aren't  real parties  happening in this  country. There was only  one real
scene-party held back in 1995, the -DEMOBIT- in BRATISLAVA.
Today just  two Atari meetings, maybe with the touch of a  fair, mixed up with a
copy party are  held every  year. The one  is held in  PROSTEJOV in  spring, the
other in  autumn in PLZEN. At  one of them, the -ATARIADA- the surviving  people
and freax meeting together.

The local czech Atari scene is holding contact mainly with FIDO CONFERENCE 68000
(Internet  too), with  a mailing  list in the  Internet, NeST (something  like a
local net, just like RTEL in France I think) but  only a few people  have access
to it and last but not least of NARSIL, a diskmag in czech language... Read more
about it below under FAEN.

A real Atari market cannot be found there. If someone needs hardware or software
he has to drive to Germany and buy it there. Older software you can still buy in
the country itself too. Three little repair services are located there were they
can buy foreign hardware too.
Some Falcon accelerators and ST harddisk interfaces  are produced  too, but they
are only copies of german stuff.
The main  and maybe only  news information source  for the czech Atarians is the
Internet, if something  isn't mentioned there  it will not  find the  way to the
czech people =( ...

Anyway I will give  you a round  up of the actions  in  the land in the heart of
Europe. I  can't guarantee the  correctness of all things  written  below  and I
hope my informations are still up-to-date.

Thanx for their informations and kewl help are going to:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...ATTACK BROS...

This coding team  consists of  two members, JAN and TOMAS. They're more  a semi-
professional band, working on tools and utilities.
Their latest  releases are "AMAIL" (a GEM Internet mailer  client) and "AFTP" (a
GEM Internet client for MiNT).

They did a game too, and it's a GEM game... called "PISKVORKY". Some other small
releases seem to be around too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...FAEN...

This team also  exists for some years now and was originally founded to produce
a game. But the coder, responsible  for this  project left the team and so this
project, a RPG, was never finished.

They released  some stuff anyway, just like a small game to  test your knowledge
about the games, released on ST, back in 1996.

Today they're mainly  busy  with  releasing the "NARSIL" magazine, a  diskmag in
czech language. It seems  to  be the first time as  this magazine  matched it to
reach a bigger public so far. I got  issue  26 and 27 and you  can check out our
review on the things there...
>--> NARSIL 26/27 <--<

Members of  FAEN are JIRI (gfx/design/code), RADEK (msx) and BEA (gfx/hardware).
They're working on several other little projects too.

...HEADACHE PROJECT...

This team  around a guy called EMPTY HEAD seems  to be the only  one so far who
managed  it to  reach a bigger  public  with their  productions, they're  doing
mainly games nowadays.

So the  old (from 1995) demo  called "TRIBUTE TO FRANZ KAFKA" was the  only one
which managed  it to jump over the czech frontier. He did it  together with NEW
DESIGN and TRAUMA of CZEX.
There is maybe another incomplete demo around (will be never finished?) called
"FREE OF ARMY" with a 3D system coded by EMPTY HEAD.

He released a  game under  the MC SOFT label too, "POWER UP" and  the follow up,
"POWER UP+". A review of the older version can be found in an older (eh...) UCM-
issue.

The most interesting  project is a  jump'n'run  game  called "BLOUMAS ADVENTURE"
and we already got a copy of the preview and you  can check our  review if it in
this mag... just there:
>--> BLOUMA'S ADVENTURE <--<
For this  project  EMPTY HEAD  is working together with JS, who seems  to be the
best czech grafician.

Furthermore  EMPTY HEAD  is responsible  for the shell of "NARSIL", a diskmag in
czech language published by FAEN... just read more below...
This magazine was  founded by  EMPTY HEAD back in 1993  and  after he  wanted to
give up the project he gave up the main editor/publisher job to FAEN.

...JAY SOFTWARE...

This little team, consisting of JAN and STANISLAV is working on little GEM stuff
too. They  just  released "JAY ZEBULAND" (a small game), a GEM shell  and  a new
version of the "MSA PACKER".

...JOY...

This is a one-man-project  and the guy behind is PETR STEHLIK. He's more a semi-
professional coder and you maybe heard of his work for the "ATARI 800 EMULATION"
on Falcon.

Other tools/utilities  are "CLOCKY", a multifunctional thing, "PARCP" a network-
system for Atari/Linux and PC and last but not least patches for MiNT.

After all he was (is, maybe?) the sysop of the JOY BBS but I actually don't know
if this board still exists.

...MC SOFT...

This is  the label  were EMPTY HEAD  published his last game "POWER UP". Nothing
more known at the moment.

Inet:    http://novell.felk.cvut.cz/~cihon.rtime/pu/pu.htm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

...NEW DESIGN...

It's just a  one-man-project and exists since 1993. The one behind this label is
Petr Sumbera. 

Besides some  demo actions (taken part in the "TRIBUTE TO FRANZ KAFKA" demo back
in 1995) he is working now mainly on the "NED PLAYER", a  sample player for DMA-
sound based Atari machines.

Last but not least he did a  game too, back in  1995, called "WHIPPERS-SNAPPERS-
RACE" and it is freeware now.

Ok, that's  it for the first time, just  to show you that  there are  still some
things to  discover in the Atari scene. At the moment  I'm trying to get hold of
every little demo piece  and maybe games stuff to from  the czech and  maybe the
slovakian scene too. If I get enough stuff in time I will ofcourse write another
special feature about it, not as real reviews, because the stuff is mainly a bit
too old but only give you a round-up of the demos we never saw so far...

_update_  Yep! There will be a second czech special in the forthcoming UCM becoz
          I already got hold of  several stuff (sometimes a bit  strange for me)
          and I think there is still a lot more to discover.
