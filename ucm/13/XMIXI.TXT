A Falcon music compilation. Ever heard  of something like that before? Probably.
ñEscapeð, òTSCCð and even óDHSð themselves have been  doing compils for  quite a while
now.

So, everyone who's familiar with compilations only  wants to know one thing: are
the tunes worth the space on your harddisk? You can also  bring the graphics and
effects used  into consideration, but  I think everybody will  agree on the fact
that the music is the most important thing.

Enough craptalk  for now, let's take a look at  the stuff. The total size of the
thing  is ñ2.6 MB (!)ð. Not  much  to  worry  about  if you  have a  big  internal
harddisk or  fat SCSI device. But  for people  with only  a small HD this is far
too  much. Especially  considering some  other good  compils only  take up about
1.4MB..

On  with  the  program  itself. It  starts  in  the  normal  DHS  tradition of a
ñvideo-mode selectorð. Then  the intro-picture is kicked  onto screen. Looks cool,
but sadly all computer-generated I guess. After that  the main-screen appears. A
cool òraytraced "X"ð is spinning smoothly in the  lower-left corner and the lower-
right corner is used for dispaying ótune-infoð.

The  center of  the  screen is  used  as  a craptalk  part (EViL, Toodeloo and a
guest-star  talk  some  bullshit, but  Toodeloo  also  gives  good  info  on the
included tunes). A functional screen that does the trick, but  isn't spectacular
in any way.

THE MUSIC::
Seven tracks  are in here.. DHS claim  that to be eight, but I  couldn't get the
last  one  to  play?!?  They're  all  multi-channel  and  give  a good, polished
impression. Most are quite  technoid and loads of newstyle instruments are used,
so I think this  music-compil  nicely  reflects the dance-music of 1998 (even if
jungle/drum and bass can't be found in here).

ñTrack 1:

Somehow  reminds  me  a  bit  of  80's  synthtunes, due  to the  usage  of older
instruments. The overall  sound  however, is  quite  flowing/dancey  90's stuff.
It's a nice relaxed tune, with a good amount of polish. I'd give this...
7 out of 10 points.

òTrack 2:

Whoops!! ClUb-T3cHn0!!!! AAARRRGGGG!! I hate  this  kind  of  music! I'm  struck
with  visions  of nobrain  people  doing  stupic  dance-moves  in  one of  those
mellowhouse-clubs. Blech! The  beat  starts horribly happy. The sound that makes
you want to become an axe-toting homicidal maniac!
But hang  on.. The beat  improves a  bit.. So it  turns out  to be a  track more
complex than the brains of clubbing people afterall. Still I don't  like it that
much..
Since I don't want to let my musical taste completely blur  my opinion: I'd give
this 4/10, cos  the polish is good once again and it  is a bit more complex than
I initially expected.

óTrack 3:

Wow! Fast beats! Manic housey melody-lines! Coolness! This  track gets your butt
of the chair  immediately. Some breakbeats are thrown in to  crank up the sound.
And later on the beats get fatter and fatter!! Like  eating lard straight out of
a can when you're stoned (or something similar ;-))
Ooh.. This track  is not so very complex, but  it kicks  phat butt!! 8/10 points
for this one.

ñTrack 4:

Starts with a bit  boring binary techno beat.. Again  some good melodylines. But
then chipsounds  too to put in  some trance! Ow yeh! The  beats get more complex
as the song goes on. No doubt about it, this is a very good song.
I'd give this one 8 out of 10!

òTrack 5:

This only differs  quite a lot  from the last two. It is  much more chilled out.
And the strings add a "cyber-relax" atmosphere to  it. But that's not all. There
is a  jazzy bassline to  go with the whole  thing too. If  the melody would have
been a bit  more complex I'd  given it 9 points, but  now it  has to settle with
8 out of 10.

óTrack 6:

Jumping beats! A lot  faster than  the last one. It  builds  up slowly.. Maybe a
bit too  slowly. It takes  quite a while  before  the  melody line comes in, but
that sounds  kinda cool. A very long track this, but I  think it needs some more
variation. 6/10.

ñTrack 7:

Only one  word: HARDTRANCE. Definetely  the  hardest  track  in the compilation.
Good strings  and it gets you moving  very quickly. A straightforward  tune with
not too much complexity. 7/10

òTrack 8:

... I couldn't check this one out for some obscure reason..?!?

Overall, the tunes  are good! Polished, good  instruments, groovy stuff  to move
to or some  to relax with. There  could have been  a bit  more  variation, but I
think that's the only drawback when you look at a musically  neutral point.

The shell is  not all that great. It does the job, but moving  the mouse results
in hanging  keys. It should have been better. Now I'd  rather settle for playing
the tunes in a GEM-oriented modplayer.

But  ok, enough  shit said.. The  tunes  are  good  and  worth  the space on the
harddisk. The shell  isn't as good as  the  one in  say, ñmodu3 by Escapeð, but it
works and gives most info you need.
