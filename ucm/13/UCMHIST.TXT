Yes! Today it  becomes  reality! The  Undercover Mag  exists since 5 years and I
(moondog, the very last one of the founders) think  it's time to  write down the
history  of this  magazine... So just  lean back  and be prepared  for a strange
story, you  will surely wonder why the mag has survived up to  now after reading
about all the strange things happened...
Ok, let's start...

Back in the  year 1992 two  silly guys, named LARRY THE MAGICIAN  and  FRITZE of
THE LATEST LAMERS (oh  gorsch...) had  the  idea  to  produce  an  own  diskmag,
because there  were so  many diskmagazines around  and it seems as every band in
the scene had to publish its own magazine.

Just  remember "AMAZINE", published by  MAD VISION  was the  king in the  scene-
oriented  corner, "MAGGIE" was produced by the DELTA FORCE, "MASSIVE MAG" by THE
ADMIRABLES  was still  there, "DBA MAG" by the dutch DISK BUSTERS  was alive and
kicking, "LEDGERS MAG" by THE UNTOUCHABLES and  friends was  produced in the UK,
"TOXIC MAG" changed its publisher from issue to issue, "DNT PAPER" came out very
regular and  even in the high north was produced a strange mag, "SCRIBA COMMUNIS
RESPONSI" by O.U.C.H. and so on... all in  one we had about 1o diskmags around,
made by guys from the scene.

So THE LATEST LAMERS thought, what  they can do we can do too since years, haha,
and the first idea for "UNDERCOVER" was born. So they wrote a very  simple shell
in the  style of the old MAGGIE GEM shell (TLB), wrote some  articles, announced
their  idea in a  german  paper magazine called "COMPUTER FLOHMARKT" where other
freaks holding  contact together  but finally  never finished  and  spreaded it,
because  it was too  lame at all, at  least it seems so, even I have  never seen
this thingie.

They asked  several people about  joining their forces and about the interest in
creating a new magazine, but got not much response... It was also the first time
that I got in touch with them, because of the magazine.

Meanwhile both guys  changed their names and called themself now DRIZZT and GARY
of THE NAUGHTY BYTES. In  the middle of  1993 they asked  me to join  their band
because they  needed still a  grafician and so I did, because  I was at least as
lame in  painting as  they were in coding or making  music. But working together
forced us to make our things better and better and so DRIZZT was going to be one
of the best  german GFA coders (ever?!) before  he started  to work in ASSEMBLER
too, GARY stopped to convert  chip musics to  tracker stuff and  created several
still nice chip and SID tunes and  even I created better grafix as  before, even
if I never reached the olymp =( ...

We still thought  about the  diskmag and  started  to work on  another mag, with
new shell and a new idea behind... it should be a german diskmag only.
I started to  work on the  design (huuuuh...) and had taken over  the job of the
editor too. We created  the name, just called UNDERCOVER and  in summer 1993 our
project was on the right way, just with delay =)
Because we did a lot of other  stuff besides the mag (so a bunch of lame compact
disx) we don't had the  time to finish  all the  stuff in  time. Another problem
was to find writers for a totally  unknown mag and it  wasn't easy  to fill some
people  with enthousiasm. The  mag  was planned  for release on 31.8.1993 and we
weren't able to hold this date.

Several people joined the writers posse in this  time and the most  of them were
already  in contact  with us for  longer time and so  the first  issue should be
mainly fulfilled with articles from our contacts only.
Others didn't liked  the idea to create a german mag, but we thought the  german
scene would  be big enough to release a german magazine. The time  passed by and
nothing happened but alone the idea to have something produced  to impress other
people gave us a lot of motivation.

Finally the first  issue of  UNDERCOVER saw the light on  the 1.1o.1993, after 4
months of hard work and going onto the nerves of our contacts.
It had a fucking  lame  shell, remembering  a bit  to the  DBA MAGAZINE shell, a
little  GFA-intro by DRIZZT (with the first GFA shadebobs ever), with  crude gfx
by me and last but not least a nice chiptune by GARY.
Anyway we  were  very proud  of it, to have  matched it  to release something by
ourselves but we never thought that it will become such extents as today.

Right  after the  release the  first DRESDEN CODING CONVENTION has  taken place,
other people joined THE NAUGHTY BYTES and so  with the end  of the year the band
growed up to nine people and the most  did something for the  UCM. With this new
members the  whole  idea of the  UCM changed  a bit to be  more and  more a pure
craptalk zine. Sometimes the craptalk part was nearly as big as  the serious one
filled with demo/games reviews and the usual stuff.

With the second  issue we wanted  to create a new shell  too and because our new
coder KYNE had taken over the job to code the next intro we had the resources to
do it and within 3 months we  matched it to create a completely new shell, coded
by DRIZZT again. Also the new intro was finished in time and so issue two hitted
the lines  at Xmas 1993 and we  hoped to match  the breakthrough within the next
year, not being the underdogs for all time.

Right after the  second release the first crisis bombed  THE NAUGHTY BYTES away.
The coders  joined the demo-posse  and so the 1st real .tnb. demos were released
in the following months. A lot of stuff was released, just like "WHEN HIFIDREAMS
BECOME REALITY", "TINY TOONS DEMO", "THE LAME THING", "XDREAM" and several small
things... but also  some disappointing things happened... the .tnb.  dentro made
the last place at the DCC 2 demo competition and  so the work on it was stopped,
KYNEs try to release a small demo  called "DARUM!" wasn't ready in  time for the
FRIED BITS 2  and so stopped  too... Anyway the  most members going mad with the
idea to produce  some demo stuff and  so UNDERCOVER, really the biggest project,
was laying at the side for months.

UNDERCOVER # 3, at first  planned for release after  the FRIED BITS 2, wasn't in
sight. Anyway  we had  the possibility  to present  the UCM a bigger public with
this party and I can  remember meeting  WINGLEADER who was afraid  to see a pure
DBA mag clone... hehe... Anyway it didn't helped us very much.

Because there was no real cooperation between  the members the strangest rumours
came up, just like I, as  the editor  had left the  band... Because  it seems as
the most had lost the interest  in creating  the mag and I don't  wanted to work
alone  on it I decided to slow down my actions  to a  minimum, but never gave up
at all! Ok, I searched in  the middle of 1994 for  another one to take  over the
job of the main editor but no one was interested in it because it was a horrible
work and because I don't wanted to let the mag die I decided to come back...

So I started to create special grafix for a Falcon shell, on PC. Later this year
I got the  info that KYNE  and mOd were  working on a new intro again and so the
mag came back  to life after  1o months of silence. It was the first  UCM with a
special Falcon shell and I think the first mag at all using the  Falcon features
at all... 256 colours and 5o KHz tracker sound, and last but not least the multi
part intro by KYNE was just great.
I had to  reanimate all the other  people too within this  time, to force DRIZZT
to create the Falcon enhanced shell and in autumn we came back! Maybe this short
pause has brought us new powers...

Short after this, within 2,5 months again we created issue 4, again with special
grafix for Falcon and a  nice  intro by DRIZZT again... therefore the idea to be
a real demoband  wasn't killed so far and again different people started to work
on .tnb. demos  and some of them  were released too, just  like "SUNRISE". Other
projects  were refused again... therefore  the band  was going  a more  and more
strange way, working on the image to be the craziest band in the  Atari scene at
all... So we worked on a bootsector  who plays a sample on Falcon  saying a very
strange fave .tnb. saying... but it was never finished at all.

With the FRIED BITS 3 the  band itself  became it's first  real knock down, KYNE
and CONNOR left  our lines to found the religious inspired  band SPIRITS. But we
thought it should be not a big  problem for .tnb. and  short after the  party we
released  UCM # 5 to be present on the TRANSMISSION CD, made by SAMURAI of INTER
together with  all FRIED BITS 3 and Falcon releases so far. Also  the release of
"...DAS BISSCHEN HIRNTOD", one  of the  strangest .tnb. demos  so far  showed us
that we were able to create something without KYNE and CONNOR.

After the  party the band got the  first real problems. It  wasn't easy to go on
without KYNE and CONNOR and I think it was a big failure to take  it easy... Ok,
we were still 7 members  but we  missed KYNE's coding power after  we checked up
that  APACHE wasn't  able to do some real demo codes. Another problem occured as
mOd was  going  to the  army and  was pissed off  by computing  at  all. Finally
APACHE was kicked out of the band as he told us that he  sold his  Falcon to buy
an APPLE. (I still really don't know why...)
With the time we even lost the interest in doing  some demos. All  projects were
never finished, mainly because of DRIZZT's interest in doing some coding work.
Therefore DRIZZT and me had the  idea to create a game but also this project was
stopped with the time, even if a lot of grafix and the level editor were ready.

The others lost a lot  of motivation too and there was nothing released by .tnb.
at all for about one year. This was the time as DRIZZT and me were the only real
active members but we don't had the power to finish at least one little thingie.
UCM # 6 was announced many times but postponed again and again because  the lack
of articles. The  only lifesign of .tnb. was a small  compact disk, made  by me,
based on  sources by KYNE, just  featuring a  lot  of unreleased stuff  by .tnb.
itself... In spring  1996 I released also  some older  monochrome stuff  made by
the .tnb. posse just to reanimate the name of the band.

At the  SYMPOSIUM'96 the band finally came back to life, but very slowly. At 1st
we released  some demostuff  again, just  remember "BSE POSITIVE" and  finally I
matched it to force DRIZZT to think about a new issue of the UCM. Therefore also
one of the biggest .tnb. projects  of this  time, it was a Falcon demo with some
raytraced grafix too (errr... I even don't remember who did them...) was stopped
too because we don't  had the resources to do much stuff and we  needed an intro
for the coming issue.
Anyway, UCM # 6  was in the  pipeline, with shellgrafix done  by  FLASH, our new
grafist and  I matched it to reanimate some of the old writers to make something
for it too.
And in August'98 we matched it to  release the  long awaited sixth  issue of the
mag, as no one thought to see it. It was a bit strange  but we got again several
reactions even if  we wanted to stop this  magazine, at least in  the way it was
produced so far. Because  the craptalk writers lost the motivation to write tons
of shit and the scene shrinked down we decided to create a new concept.

Even if we announced that  the UCM was dead we already worked on a new shell and
contacted several people or were contacted by them. 
In September I organized  a small .tnb. party and we tried to reanimate the band
too, without a big success but it is another story.

Anyway we checked  up the magazines in  the Atari scene and find  out that there
was no real  scene magazine, reporting all the things going on in the scene, was
left. The good old "AMAZINE" was dead  since  years as it was taken  over by the
HEMOROIDS and "EYE ON SCENE", the try to  release a scene only oriented magazine
by THE ADMIRABLES died one year ago too with just the second issue...
We thought that  this would be  a possibility to  find our  little corner in the
scene and so we started  to work on it, with the help of several  guys who liked
this  idea too. And BANG... XMAS 1996 we released  two issues of  the reanimated
UNDERCOVER! The shell was still coded by DRIZZT but now  without a  real idol on
the Atari scene and so no one told us we ripped off other shells.

And it seems as the scene was  real thirsty for scene  related informations. But
therefore  another crisis  hit down .tnb.  At first mOd left our  lines  to join
.tSCc. and then DRIZZT, as the last coder, decided to stop  coding at all. Aarg!
But I don't wanted to let the newborn UCM die so fast and forced  all behind the
mag to  do their best and  finally .tnb. released UCM # 8 short  before  the big
Easter party, the SILICONVENTION'97. And even DRIZZT came back to the demofront,
not only  with the UCM # 8 intro. At this  party .tnb. had the  last comeback as
demoband too  and released  two highrated demos  in the  competitions and  short
after the party a special issue of the mag was done too. Maybe .tnb. was totally
out powered  with this stuff  because after this the band never came back, up to
now and I don't think that we will see a .tnb. release again =(

Because of this  I tried  to give  the UCM a  better home and so the forthcoming
UCM # 9 should be a cooperation  with the guys of .tSCc. because  they helped us
very much  with the  time. UCM # 9 wasn't  very delayed  but had the  most buggy
shell of all times! DRIZZT was finally too tired to debug anything and  this was
his last release too so far... Because of this and all the  negative reactions I
wanted to quit the scene too, esp. as my Falcon was burned away in autumn.
It all sucked like hell to me and I don't wanted to go on.

But there were  more people involved  and they don't wanted  to give up. Even if
it was delayed very  heavy  UCM # 1o  hit the lines  in December  1997 and a new
label was born... the POETS OF DECAY. Because we made the most  stuff on the UCM
by ourselves, MC LASER & me, we decided to found this label, to  be  independent
from a normal band because we checked up that  the UCM always suffered under the
demo actions of  the bands. And we wanted to create the  best magazine  on Atari
too... so more and  more people tried to help us and  at least one of them, EARX
of FUN did a very great job in debugging and recoding the whole shell.
Anyway UCM # 1o was still created with the shell by DRIZZT and so it was a bunch
of bugs too... but it was a massive lifesign and the begin of a new era.

We also started to go in  competition with MAGGIE and matched  it to release the
UCM # 11 within two  months, two days before "MAGGIE # 25". Hehe! =) It featured
a nice intro by CHECKPOINT, the first intro made by other guys in the history of
the UCM too! Ok, the  shell was still  fulfilled with bugs but  we were proud of
this release anyway...
UCM # 12 was  released in July, a bit delayed but anyway it had not as many bugs
as before. 
Therefore  the reactions  are going  stranger and  stranger. Some people  didn't
liked our, or better my style  in writing articles but  is it my  problem that I
don't like PINK glasses?! Others were pissed of by  our funny meant  jokes about
MAGGIE and started  to slagg us like hell... just read  the  fucking "MAGGIE 26"
but let  me say... we're stronger  than ever and ready  for WAR! But be sure, we
will go our way till the end...

My message to all the pissed  people out there... if you don't like  the UCM you
must not read it! And another  thing: Before I do what  you want (just to change
my style in writing) you have to kill me!
Or with the words of STSURVIVOR: Let's keep the flame alive till  Death comes to
us! ...be sure... we will do it!

Last but not least my personal and historical greetings  to all the people I met
through all  the years of my  job to  be  the  editor  of the  UCM, who  were my
contacts, helped me creating the UCM or just met me on some party...
