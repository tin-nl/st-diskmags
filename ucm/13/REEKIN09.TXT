        óReeking Rubber 0.9ð (Preview) by òNature Atari Divisonð ñ(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------        

After several  previews (I guess I traced  this project since version 0.3) it is
slowly  nearing  perfection. This  version is  more or  less fully  playable and
features enhanced options compared to the previous version.

óReeking Rubberð welcomes the  player with a  few bumpmapping and zooming effects,
finally displaying the title screen as well as some options.
In addition to the credits  screen, you can select  the input  device, keyboard,
joystick, powerpad, several screen modes  as well as  resolution  details. Music
and Sound FX can be turned on or off.

The game itself is still -as intended- the òLotusð-like game racing game.
Within a  time-limit that  variies from level to level, the player  must reach a
checkpoint. Steering  is  relatively  easy and  more or  less identical  to  the
original òLotusð. The car offers 5 gears and can be switched to automatic.
Handling the car is identical to the original òLotusð, too.
Other cars  populate the  road, making it  more difficult  for you  to pass  the
checkpoint in time.
After reaching  several checkpoints, the player is transported to the next level
to face the same task.
So far, there  is no track selector  or something like this, but like  I said in
the headline, it is still a ñpreviewð.

The music  of the game is  pretty good  and underlines the game  well. The sound
effects are okay, too, there are very little ways to vary those I suppose.
The graphics  are okay as well, they are not overwhelming, but they do their job
well and the player does not get lost in details, which is also important.
The average  speed of the  graphics depends  on the chosen  resolution. Users of
standard  Falcons can reduce the size of the screen to have a faster display and
there is also the possibility to reduce the detail level, which had, in my eyes,
neither a huge effect on the speed nor  on the look of the  graphics, I guess it
only concerns the other cars being zoomed.
An  ordinary  Falcon in  high resolution  comes to  about  11 frames per second,
probably  a little  less. Users  of accelerators usually can view  15 frames per
second, which  is more than  enough to  play in a comfortable  way, so the  game
stays fast enough in any resolution.

Again, I rate this game ñpromisingð. However, I would have expected a little more.
The main difference between the last preview and this one consists of the option
to toggle the display and some more levels.

The computer  cars are really  stupid and stay on the same position  on the road
all the time, so  they are  very easy  to overtake. Compared  with the  original
òLotusð (1), this is  major step back, as  computer drivers were even some kind of
unfair when overtaking  the player, but not  very easy  to overtake. Compared to
for example òAtari kartsð, where  some computer players really  follow the optimal
route through the track, this is not much of a challenge.

The tracks  may still be in preparation, so  far, driving through the  desert is
not very variational, but I guess the previews are still rather regarding to the
main-game engine.

So let's  look at this way: The  racing-game-engine  is running and it is pretty
good. The  surroundings  of  the  game, menus, track selectors  and  intelligent
computer  players  as  well as  more  graphics  and sceneries  to  drive  in are
hopefully in the making.
I miss the 2 players  option from the original Lotus most, it is way more fun to
play  with a friend, I hope Nature (HenCox and  InStream) also  consider  this a
possibility.

I would  really like to  see an enhanced  kind of òLotusð game. Not  that I didn't
like the original òLotusð, but it was an ñSTð game and here we have a òFalconð.
The 3D engine  of the game  is really  running well, so  why - excuse me  if you
think  this  sounds  harsh - waste  it for  a game that plays  exactly like  the
original òLotusð, just looks a bit better?
I would like  to see a more "realistic" version of ðLotusð, where you  cannot push
the brakes with 250 km/h on sand in a steep curve, a kind of racing game where I
have to shift back one or two gears to climb a steep hill, a racing game where I
have to look for the ideal way to go through a curve.
The ñ3Dð engine and I guess the ñFalconð would enable it, so it would be extremely
cool if it would be used.
It's  not  that  I don't  like the  game as  it is. But I see  lots of  room for
improvement.
