[1] SOME WORDS SINCE LAST TIME by Phoenix/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

We are not dead, we have not abandoned the atari, we have not quit this life
and we have not migrated to Mars! No we are very much still alive and
kicking, and this is what we're going to show you, right here, right now!
With my "cute and fluffy" (hmpff!) writing style I will tell you...

So what happened you might wonder? Why haven't there been a VexNews issue
for over 4 months?! Why haven't there been any new releases? What happened
to the FTP site? Why haven't we responded to email? Where did Vectronix go?
Lotsa unanswered questions and we understand that you started to wonder and
even doubt in us!

We also hope that you understand that we needed this, as what we think, well
deserved break from all of this! If I may speak for myself the motivation
and inspiration was totally gone, I had other things to think about which I
was considering more important for a change. There are other things in life
than computers and cracking software, believe me...

A lot of people have mailed us during this time and we have not been able to
reply to everyone, we're sorry about this but things should be a bit better
now! Although, we get some mails like "why does Magic not work for me?", "I
don't understand german, help me!", "do you have any cheats for this game?",
"what is this program?" and so on... I mean, this is really not our
department. We would love to be able to have a kind of helpdesk support for
all our users, but that is simply not possible as I hope you understand.

And as from now VexNews is most likely not going to be, or even pretend to
be much else than what it sounds like, pure Vectronix News! It's taking too
much time to compile a new issue to exceed the previous, and therefore we
will make it smaller with announcements of new releases and other things we
might want to inform about.

We passed 200 subscribers a while ago, and I think this is incredible! It's
more than four times more than I expected when we started this, and I'm very
glad that the response and comments have been so positive. Then I can't even
think about how many more who are "sneak reading" through UCM... ;)

Today I believe there are many other good news resources and even more is
coming... {dhs,lgd,rg,xonline}.atari.org and www.scene-central.com to
mention some, check them out! (don't miss the english flag on xonline!).
Although, nothing stops us from writing about something if it interests us
of course, I just want to say that you should not have too high expectations
on this and coming issues of VexNews.

So, this sound all negative doesn't it? Well, I can guarantee you, Vectronix
are strong right now, we're working together and having alot of fun, we feel
very comfortable, well organized and happy with ourselves again. Also
Hardball and Lonsdale have re-appeared in the business showing that they're
still alive. You haven't seen the last of us yet...

// EGON! CD-UTILITIES V3.1.1 (c) MUCS - CRACKED BY HARDBALL

EGON! is a modern MetaDOS CD-ROM driver which works on all ST models: ST,
STE, TT and Falcon. It should even run on HADES.

// ERGO!PRO GERMAN V2.03 (c) COLUMBUS SOFTWARE - CRACKED BY PHOENIX

Ergo!Pro is THE shell for GFA-Basic development, this will make life alot
easier for anyone programming in GFA-Basic! This program is quite old, from
late 1994 more precisely, but we still feel that we must release it now as
no other crew have ever done it. Enjoy!

Note: You may not delete the .ini file or Ergo!Pro will not work anymore!
The serial number is stored in this file stupidly enough, so you better not
loose it!

// HDDRIVER V7.51 (c) UWE SEIMET

The most important features of HDDRIVER 7.5:

 - Driver for Atari SH/Megafile, SCSI/SCSI-2/Ultra-SCSI and
   IDE/EIDE/Ultra-DMA drives
 - Runs on every Atari as well as on Hades, Medusa and Milan.

   SyQuest, ZIP, JAZ, ...).
 - Special support for ZIP and JAZ drives, e. g. password-based read/write
   protection
 - Allows media with more than 512 physical bytes per sector. On the ST/STE
   an ICD compatible host adapter is required for this feature, e. g. the
   LINK96/97.
 - Special support for ICD compatible host adapters. This allows drives > 1
   GByte to be used with the ST/STE without limitations.
 - Formatting of SCSI and IDE drives.
 - Support for DOS/Windows formatted media as well as DOS/Windows compatible
   partitioning directly with the Atari.
 - Reconstruction of partition data in case the root sector was corrupted

 - Fast booting because you can configure the device numbers to be checked.
 - Support of two IDE or EIDE units (master and slave) of any capacity.
 - Arbitrary device order
 - Optional "Fast ACSI" mode gives maximum transfer rates with most SCSI
   drives connected to the ST/STE.
 - Important parameters of SCSI-2 drives can be configured, e. g. cache
   settings.
 - With the MagiC operating system there are up to 23 partitions, with
   Big-DOS up to 29 partitions.
 - Non-blocking DMA transfers with MagiC. Applications keep on running while
   data are being transferred.
 - HDDRIVER comes with several tools.

// HOMEPAGE PENGUIN V2.51 PRO (c) MATTHIAS JAAP

HomePage Penguin Pro is the full commercial version of the popular HTML
editor for the Atari. It does all the boring job for you, and creates simple
but good looking webpages in a few minutes!

By holding down alternate when you load HomePage Penguin you may choose
which language you want to work in, you have Deutsch, English, French,
Spanish and Swedish to choose from. Very good work!

// MAGIC-PC V6.00 GERMAN (c) A.S.H. - CRACKED BY PHOENIX
 + MAGIC-MAC V6.00 GERMAN (c) A.S.H. - CRACKED BY PHOENIX
 + MAGIC V6.00 GERMAN (c) A.S.H. - CRACKED BY PHOENIX

MagiC v6.00 German for Atari/Mac/PC, what more needs to be said?

Vectronix brings you all these versions which on the Mac/PC provides
excellent emulation of an Atari, and for the Atari itself provides fast
multitasking and other nice features.

// NVDI V5.00 (c) SVEN & WILFRIED BEHNE - CRACKED BY METALLINOS

This version of NVDI (Version 5.00), has much surpassed the previous
releases for Atari - or if you prefer... The Atari compatible operating
systems. Now, compared to NVDI version 4.1, there's only one version for all
operating systems and configurations available: GEM/Magic/Magic-PC/Magic-Mac
and ET4000/Nova/MatGraph-graphicscards are supported by version 5.00. The
programm itself decides which drivers for which configuration are to be
installed during installation. There are loads of improvements, e.g.:

 - Printing in the background
 - Improved True-Color/Grayscale printing
 - Support for TrueType-, Speedo, Postscript-Type-1-vectorfonts
 - MagicMac: Usage of Quickdraw (10x faster!)
 - MagicPC: More time-critical routines written in x86-code
 - New Utilities, e.g. Cops v1.08
 - 50 new VDI-functions incl. dokumentation

// PAPILLON V3.0 (c) A.S.H - CRACKED BY METALLINOS

Papillon isn't a simple development of an approved concept, but it is a
completely new product in many parts. Many functions have been reprogrammed
and have been improved. The author did use the graphical system of NVDI
v5.00 as the basical system and therefore you need NVDI v5.00 if you want to
work with Papillon v3.0. Main improvements of Papillon v3.0 are:

 - Support for more than 256 colours
 - Pictures are no longer converted to actual colour depth: Now you can work
   on TrueColor pictures while being in 256 colour mode
 - Better zoom-functions (1/2x, 2x, 4x and 8x)
 - 2-10 times faster than Papillon v2.53
 - New tools, e.g. undo brush, brightener...
 - Animated GIFs can be done
 - Support for Magic-scripting language
 - Gfx-formats: TIFF, GIF, BMP, IMG, JPG, PCX, IFF, CDI, PAC, TGA
 - New 3D-Look

// PIXART V4.32 and PIXART V4.33 (c) CRAZY BITS

Pixart was said to be dead for ages, but it's living again, now! With lots
of breathtaking new and improved features, it is back to fight for a place
in the market of graphics-programmes! Pixart v4.32 is freshening up my heart
while showing it's speed. It's completely GEM-conform, but unfortunately
there have been crashings sometimes while working with 65k color
resolutions. In 256 colours there are no problems and the programme is able
to show it's astonishing dither algorithms. If you compare Pixart v4.32 and
Papillon v3.0, you'll see that none of them must hide.

Some days after our release of Pixart v4.32 we did release Pixart v4.33. You
may wonder why we have both versions online on the ftp. The main reason is
that you cannot personalize v4.33 because it already is. Only v4.32 can be
personalized to your personal name. This could be useful for some guys. But
also there have been a lot of changes between Pixart v4.32 and v4.33. Mainly
malfunctions have been corrected and some functions have been improved.

// PARCP V3.27b (c) PETR STEHLIK - CRACKED BY PHOENIX

PARCP stands for PARallel CoPier. It transfers files between two computers.
It acts as a file network running over parallel (=printer) ports of those
computers. This allows you to copy many and large files very quickly from
one machine to another. Supported are Atari and PC compatible machines and
seven different operating systems.

[3] VECTRONIX FTP UPDATE by Phoenix/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

The Vectronix FTP site is back again, I hope you didn't miss it too much!
The address is the same as before, and so is the login. As we got a "bunch"
of new people on the list since last time I want to once again clearify the
importance of not giving these details to ANYONE! If your friends want to
have access, tell them to contact US for the information they need!

Some changes since last time though, new server software and new directory
structure! All files are now properly sorted into their own directories, and
there is also some category directories to make it easier to find. The best
part is the "newitems" directory though which contains symbolic links to the
latest releases! I hope you all will like this as much as I do.

And please! There is no need to leech every file there is at once, what
happens when everyone does this is that you're overloading the server and
we'll have to shut it down again! If anyone have the possibility and also is
willing to host a mirror of the FTP, please get in touch with us!

The site might have seen unstable for those of you who have known about it
for a while, and this is because of the DNS update of the ****************
database have been taking some unexpected time. This is not our fault, and
there's nothing we can do about it than wait.

The reason why this update is necessary is that the site is moving around on
different IP adresses, and it's not over yet! When you won't be able to
login, wait some days and it should work again! There is *NO* reason to mail
us and ask for new passwords, when we change password, we will tell everyone
through VexNews!

ftp://**************** (hehe...)

l: ********* (haha...)
p: ********* (hoho...)

If we find out that you're spreading this information we will ban you from
the site, we have the possibility to do this, and believe me, we will do it!

[4] NEW "CLASSIC" UPLOADS by Metallinos/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

Since Vectronix is existing for a long time now, we're quite sure that you
missed some of our releases during the years. Therefore we decided to upload
some classical stuff to the ftp. It's your second chance to get hold of some
goodies for the good ol' Atari computer family!

You can find some of our real kicking releases such as Trex Warrior (which
was the release which made the name Vectronix officially known to a focking
lot of people) and many other things (mainly games) which are somehow
related to Vectronix. If you like intros, most of the cracked games are
decorated with official Vectronix (or whatever)-intros written by Moonfall,
Slippy or Twilight. There's even a TCB-intro for Falocn hidden somewhere...

You can identify classic releases on the ftp if you see the word "classic"
written in front of the warez' name in newitems folder. The following
classic-goodies are available on the FTP now:

[5] MULTIBRIQUES, an ICS-Crack on Vectronix-ftp?! by Metallinos/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

If you downloaded MULTIBRIQUES (Falcon) and fired it up without reading this
text first, then you probably felt a bit curious: This game has an ICS intro
and indeed was cracked by THE THREAT of ICS! Why, you may think, do these
Vectronix-guys decorate their ftp-site with a game cracked by ICS?! Yepp,
this game has a story, indeed!

In May 1995, there was a very cool Vectronix-and-friends-meeting in
Berlin, Germany. Lot's of cool dudes gathered at ICE TEA's place who also
organized the whole party. I can remember the following people who were
there:

Beweise and HCL of Detonators,
Dumpfbacke, Ice Tea, Problem, Lonsdale, Metallinos, Moonfall and Slippy of
Vectronix,
Domm, MC, Sethos and Titan of Animal Mine,
Skinhead and The Threat of ICS and Pascal (I don't remember his pseudo that
he had in ICS anymore)
and so on... (please don't blame me if I forgot someone ;-)

We had planned to crack Multibriques at that party and wanted to release
it under the Vectronix-label. Two originals (!) had been organized (by our
main suppliers Dumpfbacke and Lonsdale) to make cracking really easy and to
enable us to find any hidden serial-numbers.

But at that party, Lonsdale had shown us an intro for Falcon written by AN
COOL of TCB. This intro was supposed to be an ICS-intro for cracked
Falcon-stuff. Unfortunately, ICS split up around the same time the Falcon
saw its first rays of sunlight and therefore the intro would never be used
by ICS. Nobody would ever see this work done by one of the most important
members of the Atari demoscene: AN COOL of TCB.

This was really a pity. All the people at that party equally decided that
this intro should be released somehow. The only thing that was needed was a
crack for Falcon done by ICS... all people were at once thinking of
Multibriques and The Threat who was at our place...

So we encouraged THE THREAT/ICS to crack Multibriques and make it an
official ICS-release where we could use that cooooool An Cool intro...

The Threat did a good job and really enjoyed showing us his great cracking
skills. It was really a great experience for us party-guys having seen one
of the big crackers of the good old days working on a game.

This is how a planned Vectronix-release turned into an ICS releases...

[6] VEXNEWSNEWS by Phoenix/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

As the number of subscribers have grown rapidly, and continue to do so, it
have become more and more difficult to send out new issues in the primitive
way we was doing it before. Today we have moved the list to a real mailing
list software which will make this job not only more simple, but also alot
better and easier to handle.

For you who is already a subscriber it won't make much of a difference, but
for new subscribers it will mean that they will get a welcome message or
"confirmation" with some information how to unsubscribe and so on. I _know_
that I have been very bad at confirming subscriptions lately, but this is
now history! (sorry if you had to wait)

Subscriptions/unsubscriptions (why on earth would anyone possibly want to
unsubscribe?) are taken cared of totally automatically (just being
overlooked) so the response should be very fast! You cannot mail to
vexnews@mindless.com and expect a human answer anymore, so please don't!

This currently also means that there is no way to request previous issues of
VexNews (not even by asking), but this feature will return soon, just
wait...

// The Welcome Message

Welcome to the Vectronix News mailing list!

If you ever want to remove yourself from this mailing list, you can send
mail to <vexnews@mindless.com> with just "unsubscribe" (no quotes) in the
subject.

For a complete list of commands, send mail to <vexnews@mindless.com> with
just "help" (no quotes) in the subject.

[7] UNDERCOVER MAGAZINE by Phoenix/Vectronix
____________________________________________________________________________

A bit delayed UCM #12 finally showed up, and it's always so fun to read
these magazines! Moondog seemed more depressed than usual though, I think he
needs a internet connection of his own to not feel so isolated and lonely in
his struggle of keeping the atari scene alive. Lotsa talk about people
complaining, and then there was not much else than complaints in the
magazine, hmm... ;) As usual, a very nice UCM issue, just with a little bad
attitude here and there! If everything in life wasn't so depressive it would
be even better I think. I only know one guy who is more depressed, and his
name is Marvin, and it's so depressive to just mention his name! Keep up the
good work!

Now though, what the hell is this?! "Pirate Support Company" - uhh... very
good headline, I think Indigo 2 will love this free commercial, it will be
very good for their reputation and business. Hell, I don't understand why
they didn't think of this on their own! Serious though, I'm sorry Marcer,
but I think this was the most stupid I have seen for ages! Of course even a
"pirate" is able to help and do things to support the atari, but to combine
the things openly like this? Not a very bright idea in my opinion....

And I still don't understand the purpose of the chatbox in UCM really, sure
it's fun to read some messages, but it makes conversation impossible! So
instead of waiting some months for comments in next UCM, I will just cover
the messages aimed for me and Vectronix quickly here. (oops, you still got
to wait some months, but atleast there hasn't been a new UCM issue yet)

Ohh, first I would just want to say that it was a nice move from Elite to
clearify once and for all they're not gonna release Running and CoC 3D.
(update: now they HAVE released Running anyway, changed your minds, uhh??).
Although one could argue about "scene releases" forever, should crackers
really have this moral to not crack some special software? Well, I think
there's no real rules here, but more or less only a matter of personal
opinion. And just as they say, people are always asking about these games,
but in the next moment we're not "allowed" to touch them, kinda double moral
if anything... Should crackers be allowed at all btw? Probably not, it's a
dirty business, nobody likes to have their programs cracked...

Hmm, then Elite is once again in a united force having "opinions" about
Vectronix. I think I said something about Elite cracking every little piece
of shareware crap they could find or something in a interview. Okay, I
admit, it's not nice to crack shareware, but again, it's not nice to crack
at all. I was looking through our releases for the last six months and I
found that we have cracked both ST-CAD and PARCP which are both shareware.
We're guilty as charged! I feel both of these meet up to the quality
standard to fit as a Vectronix release though and I don't regret it at all.
Just look at ST-CAD for example, I mean... WHY isn't it commercial? ;)

The point was not really to say that we are absolutly not ever in the whole
existence of life going to crack shareware software, it was more a thing
about some questionable releases... I mean, why release some 5 year old crap
program which other crews already did years ago anyway? In all scenes
(except on the atari then) this would be seen as not only quite, but _very_
lame! Although, it's not my job to tell you what to do, I just said what I
thought, just as you guys have expressed your feelings about our releases as
well... :)

Hmm, I didn't understand the bit about "sidekick in the back" really? I
mean, I think Elite is responsible for their own releases, if they judge
something is worth releasing, it's their decision, and I assume they will
stand up for it against whatever I or anyone else might be saying about it.
I don't see how they can feel stabbed in the back for something like this?
It's good to see that it motivates them though... but, hmm... where is the
result? ;)

Nice to see you're still hanging in there mOd! and me, quitting??? just look
at our releases above! There's one thing about quitting, or being active as
a crackerband though. Unlike a democrew we can't just sit down and be
productive and release stuff, we're so very dependent of the situation of
new software and people supplying it to us. When nothing is happening, we
look very dead, and also feel very dead and unmotivated I'd say... so, in
other words we'll be around as long as there's a need for it I guess and as
long as you want us to be around. This means if we're not getting any
originals, there's no place for us anymore! Think about it...

Update: As I wrote the above the same day UCM #12 was released it's a bit
old, but I let it remain as it contained some interesting comments. Since
then Maggie #26 has also been released and it's one of the best Maggie
issues I've seen for a long time I think. Unlike UCM, Maggie is written with
very much humour and it will surely give you some big laughs while reading
it! Maybe there was a little bit too much slagging towards UCM, but on the
whole it was a great issue! Get them both NOW if you haven't already!
rg.atari.org/dhs.atari.org should have them, and there's also a HTML version
of Maggie on Little Green Desktop. Rumours says that UCM #13 should not be
far away either now...

[8] ATARI FAIR IN NEUSS, GERMANY by Metallnos/Vectronix

And again there's a new Atari Messe in Germany! Since the last fair in April
98 was a big success, the German FALKE VERLAG decided to organize a second
Atari fair this year. The fair takes place in the "Stadthalle Neuss" in
Neuss (near Düsseldorf), Germany and it's openend from 10:00 a.m. to 18:00
on October 3-4. p.m. Unfortunately, the entrance fee for the ATARI-Messe in
Neuss is quite high: For "normal" people: 18,- DM and for pupils and
students: 13,- DM.

They promise that the ATARI-Messe 1998 will be more interesting than ever
before. A lot of news and exhibitioneers are promised which should make the
fair a real enjoyment.

The listing below shows all expected exhibitioneers until today. Personally,
I'd guess that there will be less exhibitioneers than promised, but there
will be at least so many booths that the fair is worth to be visited.

And as every time I am encouraging YOU and all of your friends to help us in
getting hold of new releases of software which will be sold during and after
the fair. Maybe they will have some good "Messe"-prices for new products or
updates?! Please keep your eyes open and send the obtained new software to
vectronix@hotmail.com!

As we are as a group working for the whole Atari-community, we are depending
upon your help and your "good will". If there's no supply for us, we cannot
spread our wings and bring the "golden warez to the poor" in scene.

The Falke-Verlag is expecting the folling exhibitioneers:

 - 16-/32-bit Systems: Games for all ATARI-systems.

 - adequate systems: Calamus-moduls of all kind.

 - AG-Computertechnik: Networksolutions for all Atari-systems, Photoline...
   I bet there will be new version of Photline.

 - aixit GmbH: TOS2WIN newest version, PCI2LIN ...
   Tos2Win, the nice emulator needs "some work" if there's a new version...

 - Application Systems Heidelberg: Cab 2.7, Texel 2.2, Papillion 3,
   MagiC Mac, MagiC PC, ...
   We're definitively awaiting new versions of their programmes... Who wants
   to provide us with originals?! ;) (NO, we do not have an inside source at
   ASH!)

 - AKA Freiburg: Packet Radio (data transmission via radio) etc.

 - ATARI-Computing England: Atari-Magazin from GB, some own products.

 - ATARI-Gebrauchtfachmarkt Peter Denk: Used Hard- and Software in masses,
   cool stuff, cheap stuff, rare stuff...

 - ATOS: Hypertext-magazine for Atari-systems.

 - Best electronics: microchipreplacements for Ataris, rare articles
   Definitively, this guy from BEST is one of the "oldtimers" of the
   Atari-fair: I can remember the golden times when I saw him at the Atari
   fair in Düsseldorf in 1987..

 - Centek: Centurbo II-Falcon-speeder, Phenix-prototype, Dolmen.
   For sure, very interesting!

 - Columbus Software: Music-software Score Perfect.
   A very good programme "which needs some crackers hands". Who is willing
   to supply us?!

 - Crazy Bits: PixArt 4, preview of version 5.
   At least PixArt v4.4 is available. Maybe version 5 on the fair?!

 - Deltalabs Media: Revolution CD-magazine, brandnew Whiteline-CD...

 - Dr. Uwe Seimet: HDDRIVER newest version, support, Diskus...
   This guy needs some motivation to keep on the good work on the Atari!
   Please buy his products!

   Hades, Milan.

   The "bad guys" among all the "good ones".
   BTW, they are the organizers of the fair. To help them having more fun,
   please go to their booth and ask for ALI GOUKASSIAN. Tell them you're a
   friend of him since ages and desperately want to talk to him. Ask them to
   call him on his cellular phone to come to the booth. If they did call
   him, just leave without a single word... He will love it... ;-)

 - Gordon Software: Arthur, translationprogramme.
   Ah! This sounds interesting! Maybe Orby (Hi!) could use this somehow?!
   ;-)

   Hm, scannerdrivers are always interesting, any ideas how we're going to
   get hold of some original disks!?

   A very useful product! Probably a new version is available.

 - Inversmedia Software: Calamus SL, additional modules...

 - La Terre du Milieu: ST-magazine from France, different programmes.
   Surely a very interesting exhibitioneer. Unfortunately these dudes are
   "French-speaking" only... BTW, the French mag ST MAGAZINE is A LOT better
   than the German ATARI INSIDE.

 - Michael Ruge: Falcon hardwaretuning.
   Probably this is the only dude who knows ALL secrets of the Atari's
   hardware.

 - Milan-Computersystems: brandnew Atari-compatible, TV-card, TOS 5.
   The MILAN with 68060 is announced to be shown. THIS can be interesting! I
   am actually looking for someone who could send me one of these lovely
   machines...

   This internet-package needs some "work"... ;-)

 - Patrick Eickhoff: Funpaint, grafix- and videocut-software.

 - PAC-Computerclub: The big ATARI-Club presents itself.

   the MILAN-company. If this stands quality or not, please decide it for
   yourself...

 - Titan-Designs: PCI-Adapter for Falcon, Falcon-speeder...
   I hope the PCI adaptor is not too expensive...

I found you crying on the wall of Devil's well... A hangman's knot around
your foot and praying for the spell to be shattered. May I be the one to rip
those shackles clean away and lead you to a place where loneliness is
tackled with a kiss? A kiss that has no ropes, no strings, and no
obligations. I don't owe you; be quite sure that you don't owe me.
