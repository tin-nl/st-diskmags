                              òTerminal Velocityð 
             óGodboy Xð : óMega Man 2ð ò[Reservoir Gods]ð ñ(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------            

From the  famous òReservoir Godsð comes the next generation of  the óGodboyð series.
The óGodboyð series  was a  kind  of ñGameboyð emulator for  the  Falcon. Since  the
Falcon is  a bit "slow" for this kind of duty, the òReservoir Godsð decided to try
to enhance  each  game  for emulation and  therefore  make  a "special", a "non-
generic" emulator.
The series so  far included ñBubble Bobble, Bomb Jack, Super Mario Land, Mega Manð
and ñKirby's Dreamlandð.
With  the  óGodleNESð  series, a  non-generic  ñNES Emulatorð  for  the  Falcon, the
òReservoir Godsð seem to have acquired  new wisdom  about  emulation technique and
now  present  the enhanced  version of the òGodboy emulatorð and call it òGodboy Xð.
The first release is òMega Man 2ð.

The óGodboy Xð emulator  comes, as typical, with a title-screen where òsh3ð seems to
have been  converting the original japanese cartridge title, looking pretty nice
and featuring high-res even on RGB monitors.
As before, several options can be selected. Info, Options, Trainer and Start can
be manipulated.
Info of course demonstrates who did what and as usual, òMr.Pinkð did all the code,
òsh3ð did  all the "additional" graphics, òMSGð made the music and òTatð wrote the DSP
replay routine.
Options feature additional items in comparison to the òGodboyð games so far. Again
you can choose between keyboard and PowerPad control and you can turn on/off the
music, but some óGodleNESð options seem to have made the jump to the óGodboyð, too.
You can  turn the clipping on/off which means that sprites may get "behind" each
other or  not. Correct display means loss of some CPU time and you may very well
choose to have a faster emulation rather than a 100% correct one.
You  can  also  turn  the  coloured  display  off. óGodboyð coloured  the  sprites
differently  as the ñSupergameboy expansion moduleñ for the  SuperNES does. If you
want "true" gameboy feeling, just switch it off.
A bit  weird for  a Gameboy-User are the options ñ"Overscan"ð and ñ"Widescreen"ð. As
far as I  was informed, the gameboy display was rather  small and  puny, what do
these options mean?
Easy, they  do what  they do in the óGodleNESð series. With Widescreen  turned on,
the display  will be zoomed so that it is bigger and  additional "overscan" mode
zoomes the display in vertical direction, too, so you have a VERY large display.
In contrast  to the óGodboyð series so far, óGodboy Xð doesn't feature samples being
played as replacement for the original Sound FX.

When starting  the emulation, the  average óGodboyð player will fall off his chair
first. óGodboy Xð is fast. Very fast. Extremely fast.
ñMega Man 2ð runs on a  simple standard Falcon without any accelerator in RGB with
music  AND clipping  switched  on - maximum  comfort - almost  as  fast  as  the
original. Of  course the  emulator  will  slow  down  a little if there is  MUCH
movement on the  screen and will speed up if there is little  movement, however,
óGodboy Xð stays in the fast lane all the time.
Controls  are  being  excellently  emulated  as well, whatever control  you have
chosen, keyboard or PowerPad.
You also have  hotkeys to manipulate Emulation during gameplay like you have had
in the óGodleNESð series.
With Overscan and Widescreen turned on, you almost forget that you actually play
a gameboy game and it doesn't even seem to affect the gameplay.
Finally not to miss out the excellent music òMSGð has created for this purpose.
Sad are the  gameboy owners  who have to play the original and can not listen to
this great soundtrack which supports the game perfectly.

So  the result  about  this  emulation  is: Excellent. òMr.Pinkð  really  did  his
homework and  figured out a way to speed the gameboy emulation engine up that is
hard to believe, after all, the Falcon is just a little more than 4 times faster
than the Gameboy and  considering the very special custom chips and  display the
Gameboy uses, it is very astonishing to see the pace of this emulation.
Together  with the  Trainer, the  options  and enhancements like  Widescreen and
Overscan and  not  to  forget  this really fantastic  music, óGodboy Xð is  a full
success.

It has  only one  disadvantage: The game  being  emulated  is hardly  worth this
excellent emulator.
To be honest, ñMega Man 2ð may  be a legend for gameboy players, but it isn't very
good in my eyes.
The graphics may be very good for a gameboy cartridge, they are not in the first
level, but they  do get pretty good  in the 2nd or 3rd level. The sprites on the
contrary look VERY simple mainly  and sometimes, because the lack of colour, the
sprites are hard to realise in front of a mixed up background.
The game  itself is  very hard  and I  dare to  say in  some special  cases very
unfair, too. It  happens  quite  often  that  you can  not  "hit" the  target by
shooting at it, but on the other hand it may very well hit you.
Especially  when traveling on  the lifts in level one, you'll hit  the opponents
often enough with very little chance to escape.
In other  occassions it's only a tolerance of one pixel wether  you live through
the danger or not and this is very hard to control.

ñMegaMan 2ð gets so  unfair sometimes I would have thrown the original Gameboy out
of the  window for a few times. With the Falcon, I pressed  the "*" to leave the
emulation quite some times.
The game may  not be bad for fans  of this genre, but the class  of ñTurricanð for
example is not being reached, the game is and stays too unfair and difficult for
that. It's a  bit sad that this  great emulator is being "brought down" a little
by the game it emulates.

Which brings me to the summary.
The emulator  is excellent, there  is no  question about  it. òMr.Pinkð once again
showed his  skills in optimising algorithms  and code  and òMSGð once again flexed
his muscles and produced an excellent soundtrack.
The game itself is not so hot and stands very clearly behind the óGodboyð releases
ñSuper Mario Landð and ðKirby's Dreamlandð, although  they had  NOT been  given THIS
kind of emulator, but are more fun to play.
However, people  who liked ñMegaMan 1ð already  will definetly get the most out of
this one as it plays a lot faster and smoother than the ñMegaMan 1ð emulator.

Another question pops up. Now that ñMegaMan 2ð, which features scrolling and quite
some sprites  on screen at  once, is being emulated at this very accurate speed,
it is probably possible to code a "generic" emulator that is capable  of playing
"most" of  the GameBoy  cartridges which  are now available (even if illegal) on
the internet.
Of course this  would mean to lose òMSGð's great tunes and it may also be slower
because  optimisations  may  only be  possible  for  one specific game, however,
Nemesis or  CenTurbo I users would  probably get a generic  gameboy  emulator of
acceptable speed and now that CenTurbo II is available ...

Well, just  some  thoughts. I do  hope  the  òReservoir Godsð use  this  excellent
emulation  engine  to convert  some  more  games - and  there definetly are some
GameBoy games I would really like to play.
So Reservoir Gods: Keep up the Good work.
