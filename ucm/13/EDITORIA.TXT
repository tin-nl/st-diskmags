óMoin moin!

Here we go again, with another issue of THE scene diskmag for your Atari STe and
Falcon and whatever.

Today is  the 3o.o9.1998 and it seems as I have no  chance to hold  the internal
planned release date, the 1.1o.98... This problem occured within the  last days.
I will change my flat (at least I have a new one rent) but at the moment I can't
make it happen... a lot of problems in my family are the reason for this.
At the moment I have to  help my mother to  renovate their  new flat too... this
means I coming home  from work and  going to work again right after  I parked my
car in front of our house... shit.
Because of this I lost a lot of  time which was thought to make the last touches
on the current issue of the UCM. I also  started to edit some  articles right in
the morning, short before going to work (with the coffee-pot standing on my good
old ST...). Anyway I'm still sitting here... and there is still much more to do.
Up to now I edited about 1 MB of articles and there are still more to check and
include... we'll see how long I need for this... no promises, eh?! =)
But let's go for the real editorial before some give-your-brain-away from the UK
will start to slagg me of, because I'm writing about "problems"...

I think it's time for a big view back to the first steps of this magazine and as
the last  survivor of the guys who brought  this magazine to life I  had to take
over the job to write  down the ówhole  historyð, with all  highs and lows  of the
last five long years, just to show you how the things  started and how many hard
fights we had just to save the life of the magazine.

But hey, it's  strange too... as you will see here in the  main menu, the writer
staff changed. Meanwhile  ómOdð of ò.tSCc.ð  nearly left our lines completely (maybe
he don't want to work together with guys who are fucked off by the ñMaggieð butts)
and also  ó5o5ð of òCHECKPOINTð did not much this  time (because he wasn't satisfied
with our  way too, eh?) other guys have  joined the  guilde of the  UCM writers,
just  like  óThe Paranoidð of òPARANOIAð/òThe Lunatic Asylumð  and the man  behind the
shell itself, óEarXð of òFUNð. Both of them wrote  a lot of articles for us and esp.
the first one surprised us with his numerous reviews of actual softwares.
Thanx guys! But we have to thank the others, who helped us out with several very
interesting and sometimes exclusive articles too...

Ok, what we  have there? There are  a lot of highlights this time! Just like the
óexclusive reportð of the òWORLD OF ATARIð in Las Vegas/United States!
Furthermore we bound some very interesting people on our interview-chair, and so
people like  ómOdð of òtSCcð, óLeonardð of òOXYGENEð, óOrbyð of òELiTEð, óDeezð of òMIND DESIGN
and some others, sometimes you'll be surprised by their views and meanings!
Ofcourse we have  reports of the latest parties, just like the òQUAST'98ð, the òJEM
(aka òGIGAFUN'98ð) and the òRTS ð(Return To The Source) òPartyð.
Maybe you will miss  the realtime article from the QUAST PARTY but  after I have
checked that this awful long article (about 18o KB) was written nearly in polish
language alone (except some  entries in swedish (Hi Deez! =) ...) and  dutch (Hi
Pieter!) with just  a few english lines and messages, I decided  to exclude this
text... It isn't only  the polish language, furthermore UNDERCOVER and maybe all
other magazines in western Europe can't display all the polish letters right =(.
But there are  other things  included in  the BIG scene part... so you  can read
something  about the CZECH (!) Atari scene, there is a swedish scene report, you
will find the history of the polish ST scene and much more.
The rest  of the mag is filled with a  lot of actual reviews, a bunch of coding-
hints, the last and BIGGEST regular charts at all (we will change the concept).
And hey... ñdedicated toó MSGð of òRESERVOIR GODSð is the reanimated adult-corner!
All in all we have about 1.1oo kb of articles for your pleasure!

And what means this all?! There is still something  going on in our Atari world!
Gosh... maybe you think moondog is under  drugs now! Arrrg! I'm  positive?! Huu!
No way dudes! I'm still  the same, and if I don't like something I will write it
down... but  except the last  ñMAGGIEð issue (read  more about it in  this issue!)
there wasn't anything I had to grumble about.

Another thing, or better another guy to grumble about  is still around... No! It
isn't óMR PINKð! I was really  surprised as I heard of some guys that óEVILð of òDHSð,
yes, the one from Sweden, is going mad because I'm fucking him over?!
What the hell? All the things going very cruel! Some people are already speaking
about a split  of the scene! óYES! IF YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT, YOU HAVE TO DO IT!ð We
will report also in the future about ALL things going on here!
And to óEVILð (hey, you  get a very  private part here! Glorious, eh?!) I  have to
say that I don't  know what's going on in  your head. If  you feel  better after
kicking the  òUCMð out of the  òDHS pageð, deleting all messages  about the UCM from
your guestbook and not giving any information about  forthcoming issues you have
to do it. We will go on, with or without you...
But let me say that it isn't  the best for the image of your page to start now a
campaign  of desinformation... if  you think  that it's  worth, again, it's your
private  decision. Fortunately  we have our  own page to spread the  UCM around,
and I don't mean the òUCMð (shit) page... all new issues of  the UCM are laying on
the ó.tSCc. pageð  too... so we don't need  urgently  your page  and we will never
begging for the point to be present again on it...
And let  me say it again: óAS LONG AS THE UCM IS RUNNING UNDER THE POETS OF DECAY
óLABEL WE WILL GO òOUR OWNð WAY!
Maybe many of you haven't checked it up to now. We're not going the way of self-
destruction or  something like that! And a  DEAD ATARI scene would be  the worst
thing for us because we belong to this scene and we're a part of it! And we will
fight for its existence, maybe in another way as some others...
Anyway, we're óKAMPFBEREITð! (FRONT 242 rulez for ever!)

And there are  more things coming up! And it  is very strange  because I got the
information that  someone has spread this information already  around before the
UCM was released. The topic: ñMoondog has bought a PC!
ò"What?! Where is this machine?"ð I thought as I heard about it! ò"Cool! Maybe it's
òstanding under my table?!"ð I looked there and found just a big box with a lot of
damaged Atari hardwares... Hmmm. I taked a sneak  look to my right and  saw just
an Atari STE, I borrowed from a friend for testing STEwarez.
ò"Where the Fuck is my PC?! Grrr!"ð After I  searched in my  whole room  I didn't
found it. ò"Hey! Maybe my mother has hided the machine in the kitchen?!"ð I runned
over there and saw a lot of technical equipment. A refrigerator, but except some
food  there was  nothing inside... ò"Hell! I want to have MY PC now! Ok, maybe it
òis a minitower?"ð I thought and opened the microwave... nothing.
After some hours in the floor I reached the second floor... and there  was a PC!
An old 386DX4o with a  massive 1o5 MB harddisk, a damaged soundcard and horrible
512KB grafix memory! Great, but it was the old machine of my brother...
Ok. I have to stop here! I don't know right who spreaded this information around
but I heard the first cruel thoughts about  it, just like  why I don't  bought a
new Falcon instead, or I slowly want to stop my activities on Atari or something
like that. Pure shit! I can  imagine who spreaded this info and I'm a  bit angry
because I don't got the permission to spread informations he gave me...
So you can't trust even the people you knew since years?! Would be shit!
Anyway... now the facts.
At first. I WANT TO BUY A PC! This is right! And I will do it hopefully the next
          time (when I have enough money).
At second. I won't quit the Atari scene! I will buy this machine FOR my work for
          this scene! Why a PC?! For the InterNet! As I  know the use of a PC is
          the best and cheapest way to enter the Inet, and  in comparison to the
          Atari, where still is  no stand-alone-browser around  at all  also the
          most comfortable  way. But... it isn't the only  reason, I'm a big fan
          of realtime strategic games and on the PC there are tons of this games
          around! Warcraft I & II, The Settlers  I + II (soon also  III), Age Of
          The Empires, Command & Conquer and so on. AND I WANT TO PLAY THEM!
So... all things  clear? Of course I will  use the PC mainly  for playing, hehe,
but it will give me the possibility to surf around in the Inet TOO.
I'm still thinking about buying a new Falcon, maybe next year again, I will see,
but at the moment I'm not hard working in this way, sorry.
Anyway, all who said this is the first sign that I will leave the scene will get
a big slapp in their face, there are more issues of Undercover on the way!

But just wait and be surprised!

                               ok... have to go now and write some more articles

                                         and again: óNO RETREAT AND NO SURRENDER!

                                                         òSTAY COOL - STAY ATARI!
