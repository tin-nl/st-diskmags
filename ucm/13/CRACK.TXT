Here it is, the first preview of the  óPacman cloneð that has  the job to beat the
good old ñ"CRAPMAN"ð by òSYNERGYð, done back in  1993. At least it was  announced to
be the beater of this game, if it will match it is another question.
Maybe you remember  the "original", ñ"CRAPMAN"ð, which was  included in  the great
ñSYNERGY MEGADEMOð which was released sylvester 1993/94 and was  the last and also
the most impressive production of this dutch band which  splitted up short after
this demo. Later  óMR NIð of the  òTOS CREWð released a  óstand-aloneð version  of the
game too which was spread all over Europe.
Without any doubt  and at least for  me ñ"CRAPMAN"ð is the best  óPacman cloneð on a
simple STF ever, featuring nice grafix, hughe levels  and some of the  best sid-
musics  ever composed  on the Atari, by óSCAVENGERð... But let me  go over  to the
competitor now...

At first all users of a STF will be disturbed... in comparison with the old game
this one doesn't run on a STF anymore, uses the óSTE featuresð like the DMA-sound,
the bigger palette and the STE joystick ports.
So for me  it isn't a real competitor for ñ"CRAPMAN"ð because it's done on another
hardware level. So it would be the same to compare STE and Falcon games and this
is just  senseless. I would compare  it more with ñ"PACMAN ON E's"ð, done  back in
1993 by some guys I don't remember right (sorry).

By the way... it is a  really strange name for a  game but alone the reason that
the makers, òTEENAGEð, are from Holland should say all, hehe. Of course I hoped to
see now some stuff like hemp  plants or needles on the screen but what I saw can
you read at next...

The first  preview  of ñ"CRACKMAN..."ð comes in  two parts. At  first you  have an
intro with  all the  informations to  the game and then the "real" game as stand
alone part. The intro  features some demo look-a-like stuff and a technoing msx.
Ok... nothing special but does the job to make the  fingers of the gambler sweat
and to let him search for the Jagpad.

The game itself starts with a title screen and as  said above  techno music, and
I think  it's no  question  which kind of  ótechnoð... it's typical ódutch hardcore
stuff... err... even in my techno times many years ago I didn't  liked this kind
of music, but  it's my personal  opinion. The grafix  using  the òSTE paletteð too
and so it's a pure STE game and leaves right now this impression.

The game itself  is òa bit strangeð  for me. As in the instructions  said you have
to use  the Jagpad  instead of the Keyboard  because it  will  go better. But it
doesn't run in the way it  used to be, because the  main effect  of the game, to
lay mines in  the way of the  ghosts, and this  is the  only difference to other
Pacman games, doesn't  work, not even with Pad. So the game  is too hard to play
if there isn't the chance to kill the ghosts. The first level  is finishable but
the second is already too hard without mines.

Your enemies have all  a very special way to move. Some following  your control,
other just trying to be always on the same level as  you (if you're moving up or
downwards  it does the same) and so on. In the first  level you have just one of
them and so it goes. If you have problems just  try to reach  the starting point
because  they can't  cross this point  and if you're  standing  on it they can't
catch  you, so it's your  only safe place in the  whole  game. But in the second
level you have three different enemies and so it's just a  question of time till
they coming  over to  you together... You're dying  with a bloody  animation and
after you lost your three  screen lifes you will see a big Smiley with a hole in
the head... hm...

So  what is  left? Just a  nice styled  other Pacman  clone. You have nice drawn
grafix, using the  STE palette consequently, nice animated  and different styled
enemies, several sampled  sound effex (because there is no music  you have a lot
of bass drums  while eating the pills in your way), with  techno music pepped up
status screens and except the option to lay down mines a good working control.

òConclusionð: Ok, because  it's a very  early preview version I  have the  hope to
            see a full working version next time. For  òPacman fanaticsð it's also
            in this  version interesting even  if it's  hard to play without the
            mines. But  to  beat ñ"CRAPMAN"ð is  still much  work to  do, remember
            that this game had  a lot of  original  musics, tons of levels which
            were never  unfair, it was nice designed  and features also a little
            story too. On ST itself ñ"CRAPMAN"ð will  perhaps  never be beaten and
            on STE ñ"CRACKMAN"ð isn't much better as the old ñ"PACMAN ON E's"...

ó...update...ð Yes... an update! I got the ñbetarelease v1.1ð and was surprised! The
whole thing got some new features as well as some other changes.

At first you will  find the  story of ñ"Crackman"ð in the  readme.doc  which comes
along with the game. Nice and funny stuff!
Btw, the game should run now on Falcon too.
The intro sequence was removed (or is at least not included in this file). There
is a ònew musicð  in the game-intro itself included, not the  dutch hardcore stuff
anymore, much softer and with nice low bass.
Maybe the first version  runs with the mines option but I failed in reaching the
levels to collect them. The òlevels are new arrangedð and the harder one (standing
at second in the earlier version) comes up a bit later. Anyway the game is going
harder  very fast, maybe  too fast. A more moderate  increase of  the difficulty
would be better.
òLaying minesð runs, is a nice feature and blows the ghost's to heaven.
Other features are included too, so there is a speed up bonus and if you collect
this bonus a stomping and fast techno jingle is replayed as long as the speed-up
is active.
More to say? There are maybe some òhidden goodie-areasð included but I don't found
one of them so far. Anyway if yes, a nice feature too.
The grafix  aren't changed  and need sometimes  still a lot of more  colours, at
least some stuff in the background or so.
Also the status bar could be designed a bit better, not overlaying the levels or
if yes, using  other colours. A display for the number of  collected mines would
be cool too.
Not so good is  the point that you will loose  the mines you collected if you're
leaving  a level without using them... erm... not a game for  pacifistic people,
eh?! =)
Anyway, with this new features I have to change the ratings a bit... so here are
my ratings for v1.1!

       óCrackman in search for his dealerð (Preview) by òTNHð 1998 ñ(STE)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cool. Another òPac Manð clone. I really  like òPac Manð. God knows how  many hours I
spent at ñLuebkeð's place playing òPac Manð. I have òPac Manð on all my  computers and
of course so far, òPacMan on Eð and òCrapmanð were my favourites, only beaten by the
original òMs.Pac Manð on the ñAtari 2600ð.

óCrackman in search for his dealerð boots and immediately starts to play some cool
music  and display some a really weird logo. The soundtrack can be  called close
to  Gabber, but  it definetly  is techno-style, and so are  the graphics  of the
title  sequence. Not too much is being shown there, as it is still a preview, so
let's start the game.

óCrackmanð starts to  chew and gulp these little pills, followed by first one, and
in the higher levels more monsters, which don't look like ghosts by the way.
Crackman  scrolls  vertically and the mazes are not necessarily  symmetrical, in
opposition to the original òPac Manð.
The first  maze is a  little larger than  the screen and scrolls  vertically, so
does the second, which is even larger.
When óCrackmanð gets  touched  by  a monster, he/she/it  screams  and dies  a very
bloody  death. The  large pills lying  around in the  maze seem not  to have any
effect, at least I couldn't eat monsters after  having taken such  a pill. I can
not  affirm  anything  special  happened  at  all, perhaps  this  feature  isn't
implemented yet? Or do I have a faulty copy? Strange ...
During game, you  have crystal clear  sound effects through the  speaker, but no
music. The sound effects are a bit twisted like the rest of the game.

óCrackmanð is however in a bad position  for a start. òCrapmanð by  Synergy Software
Development  and  finally  released by ñWingLeaderð of ñFUNð and ñMr.Ni!ð of ñTOS Crewð,
is hard  to beat, and  so far, I see  no chance for óCrackmanð to beat  that, also
òPhenomenonð promised so on IRC.
óCrackmanð reminds me  more of  good old òMcMinosð than of òCrapManð. The  mazes are
look  similar and  the fact  that there are less/more than 4 monsters  on screen
which do not look like ghosts either suggest that relationsship.
óCrackmanð is technical well presented, the scrolling is  smooth, the sprites move
without any flicker or hopping.

So far I lack the fun and the fascination of òCrapmanð and especially the 2 player
mode of  course. óCrackmanð is still in preview  yet and I  would be  happy to see
someone top  the style, the fun and the fascination of òCrapmanð, as it would mean
an even better òPacManð-like game for me to play, but so far, in direct comparison
to òCrapmanð, óCrackmanð clearly loses the fight.

No need to worry, óCrackmanð is a good little game that is also fun and deserves a
good rating  for the preview. Let's see  what òTeenageð comes up with  in the next
preview.
