The story:
The plums  live happy and  in freedom in  the sky, but  one day, the  evil Dader
appears and captured all the plums. Not all the plums, Blum the hero of the game
was abroad and  so he escaped. Of course he immediately try to free  his friend.
And so on, I'm sure you know the story.

The gameplay:
Blum is a jump and run like Starioland or Heartland etc. you control Blum trough
12 levels  including 4 big enemies. You can't shoot  an enemy or  destroy him by
jumping on him, so  you have to avoid every  contact with  an enemy. Besides the
enemies, you have to jump on moving tiles and avoid falling into  the sea on the
bottom of the  level. Besides trying  to survive, you could collect coins to get
extra lives.

The graphics:
The intro including  rendered pictures who explain the story. It's  a nice idea,
but nothing  spectacular. The game graphics  are hard to  review. Some parts are
well  painted with  a lot of details, other  parts are  dull painted, some parts
are  colourful, other  parts are  a little bit too dark. The  font used  is very 
colourful, but because of  that sometimes hard to read. I missed a status bar in
the game which shows you the number of coins you collected, etc.

The sounds:
There are many mod's, who sounding really good.

The control:
The decision if a jump and run  is a good one, if mainly a question  of control.
Games like Starioland making a lot  of fun because of their smooth control. BLUM
instead  has a  little bit  frustrating  control, because  you  have to  be very 
concentrated  the whole time, to jump at the right point. Especially  the joypad
control is very frustrating, because you can't jump while you are running (there
is a  new update, which  solved that  problem). With  the keyboard  control it's
possible to jump while you are running, and because of that the games makes much
more fun.

The difficulty:
The game is very  hard. Too hard I think. Unfortunately there are some points in
the game when you just solved a part, that you come to another  hard part, where
you fail, and you have  to start from the beginning. More retry points needed in
the game. On the other side this is a challenge of course. There is  a very easy 
mode where you have infinite lives, but even in this mode you have to train hard
to see the further part of the game.

Finally:
BLUM offers the Falcon  feeling with colourful  graphics and mod's, but it looks
like a beta Version.

Stephan Pollok supports Shareware in Germany.
At the moment there is no one in Germany who supports foreign shareware products
and especially games. So Stephan Pollok decided to do the job. BLUM is the first
program he  supports, others should  follow, if enough people are interested. So
if you created a program and want it to be supported in Germany contact Stephan.
