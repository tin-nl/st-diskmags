           óFungleBeatsð - òFUNð [QuaST Party release] 1998 - ñ(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------           

So far, òFUNð was rather  known for releasing games (ñSnatch, Crapman, Men ar warð),
but not directly for programming demos. Nevertheless, óFungleBeatsð by coder òEarXð,
is a megademo that doesn't need to hide before other demos of today.

The demo welcomes the viewer with a òFunð and a óFUNglebeatsð logo...
Pulsating  logos that is. The  whole demo is  synchronised very strictly  to the
music, which  of course features ñfungleð style. After a few pulsating effects the
demo lists  the òmembers of funð with moving sprites over a rotated  cube and then
switches/jumps between plasma effects and plasma-tunnels.

It is hard to  follow the single  effects of the  demo as this is no "continuos"
demo  like  for example òteardropð, but the effects  are  being  changed  and also
repeated very rapidly.

So  we  have  a ñplasma-tunnelð, ñ2D-plasmasð, ñdistorted 2D plasmasð, ñvectorgraphicsð,
ñrotative zoomingð ... and  some ñinterpolation effectsð as well. The style  of  the
demo  reminds  a bit of òGrotesqueð by ñOmegañ oder ñDHS'ð famous òTyrannyð, as the demo
is rather like a "background" animation to the music.
The final effect however deserves an explicit description.
Everybody has  seen ñVoxelspaceð effects on the Falcon in several  demos. But this
time, the  viewer is not  only being moved rapidly over a voxel-space landscape,
but additionally very long. The resolution of the voxelspace is really very high
for  the speed  and it doesn't  even suffer from cutting  faces or edges  at the
border  of  the  screen. After  flying  over  a  pyramid (cute), the  voxelspace
is finished and the  demo ends in a nice graphic of a beach at sunset displaying
credits and some greetings.

Without  the fulminant finish  with this  voxelspace  routine, óFungleBeatsð would
have  been a  good demo already. Synchronisation  between  music and  effects is
excellent, the  effects run very "clean" and are well designed. The colours used
for most effects  are friendly, for example, the  plasma and the tunnel are kept
in a b right blue. The graphics being used are  looking good as  well, the music
may not be my favourite style, but it is very good and being well replayed.

The last effect of the demo however really beats all similar effects in any demo
so far. This voxelspace routine  displayes what òEarXð is able to do on the Falcon
and it is really very very impressive.
So, the  overall  design is  good, the  single  effects are good, leaving  me no
choice but to call this demo a ògoodð one.
