
                            Vibrations reviewed..
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Welcome everybody  to this  new section, which  is simply  aimed to  review some
modules (= music done  with trackers), especially modules done  on or  for Atari
computers.

Some thanks have to go to Mc Laser and Toodeloo who are more or less responsible
for the idea of this section.

I also suppose there are many musicians hoping for some feedback, that should be
given here in a way.
This issue contains reviews of modules composed by:
COMP7       of    BASSMENT
DMA SC      of    SECTOR 1
DR. MAX
MC LASER    of    .tSCc. & PoD
TOODELOO    of    DEAD HACKERS SOCIETY

Of course all ratings are subjective - very subjective.
However, I tried to create a bit of an objective picture of the reviewed modules
by regarding several directions:

The points I consider important are:

IDEAS         -  Is the module original or just a copy of stuff done before?

COMPOSITION   -  How are the ideas realized?
              -  Are the  sounds detuned  or is everything  harmonic (as long as
                 harmony seems to be wanted)
              -  How is the "Art of Tracking" used?
              -  Is it exciting?

SOUND QUALITY -  Are the samples noisy?
              -  Are they already overused?
                                 
GENERAL KICK  -  Does the module rock?
              -  Is it boring or do I like it?
              -  Does the track make my head moving?
              -  Do I keep or delete it?


The "reviewsystem" includes  the point of view, that 4-channel mods  are as hard
to do as multichannel modules - if not even harder.
A really good 4-channel module is hard to do, because the composer can only make
use of  those 4-channels. And 4-channels are really few - if  you consider, that
an average song has to include bass, drums, melody, accompany, etc.
And if  somebody manages to put all this stuff in only  4 channels, I appreciate
this work a lot.

In other words, multichannelmods have to kick ass to impress me.


Here is a little explanation of what the overall ratings (percent) do mean:

If I say:   0-20%         -     the module is very bad, boring..  it sucks.
           20-40%         -     as 0-20%, but some nice ideas or parts in it
           40-60%         -     quite  ok or  average, some  good and  some  bad
                                parts in this module, not a "must have"
           60-80%         -     very well  done and  pleasant  to listen to, but
                                still some musical bugs left
           80-90%         -     This module  belongs to  the upper  10000, great
                                and impressive - for me.
           90-100%        -     don't know (perfect maybe)



This time I reviewed 10-15 modules. It's actually not as easy to review modules.
I cannot  describe everything and mostly I mention things that are important for
me. Maybe  you can  expect more  details about  the modules I  review in further
issues of UCM, as speaking about the different parts more precisely.

If there is  anyone who wants me to review his module/s, you can contact me. But
please don't ask  for tons of reviews. I have more  than enough work  to do with
those damn Toodeloo-releases.

"AGRESSION"

Author:        Dr.Max/ ???
Released:      in "Teardrop" - Quast 98 demo entry by Mystic Bytes
Format:        Mod (4 Channel)
Style:         hard demo style
Source:        dhs.atari.org


This is  one of  the typical  modules for Poland. As in most  polish demos, this
song is very hard again, and full of effects.
After a small intro of 10 seonds, you get the main part. 
Everything is fast, lots of changes, maybe too many from time to time.
You can hear a lot of nice, but hard analogues and bass.
The tune  is full  of effects, like crys, beeps, wind  etc and consists  of many
many parts, divided by nice breaks.
The track is played in ultrahighspeed, what makes it a bit chaotic.
But actually nice chaotic.

You also get a nice melody, using brasses. It reminds me a lot to Amigamods.

A cool demomod, a bit too much sound, if you are listening to it the first time.


Ideas          ?        70% - Many! Cool breaks, hot lines..
                            - good use of drums
                            - the style is a bit too hectic
Composition    ?        70% - maybe too many switches between different parts
                            - the  commands, the tracker  offers are  used in an
                              impressive way
                            - great lines and drums!
Sound quality  ?        80% - Ok for 4 Channels
General Kick   ?        75% - Kicks, especially if linked to the demo
                        ==  - but depends on the taste a bit, as it is hard
                        73%

"AWAKENINGS"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society

Format:        GT2 (Graoumftracker)
Style:         Strange
Source:        dhs.atari.org


In the beginning there was... there were...  some beeps.. some more deep beeps..
yes, and some fast wood percussions.
"Awakenings", maybe in Jungle or whereever.

This track was just aimed to be strange, and it is strange.
It's really  hard to rate this one. On the one hand you can say: It's lame crap,
done to make us say: "What a great idea - just sounds! - this is art!"

But what about saying: "This is just crap, done by somebody who cannot compose!"
...

Well, I rate very subjective then..


Ideas          ?        20% - Pure Percussion - no new idea - just an experiment
                              I suppose (fucking hard to rate!)
Composition    ?        50% - maybe it  is simple, but the whole thing succeeded
                              to be pretty strange actually.
                            - the  samples  are used  at  the right  time  to be
                              strange
                            - nice rythms, too
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        10% - it has potential to kick, for people living in the
                              jungle
                            - for me not at all

Source:        dhs.atari.org


This song starts off with some relaxed vibes, accompagnied by some deep and long
basses. This  small  intro  part ends  after  about  90 seconds  and  the  track
continues in a more beaty and groovy way.
Cool analoguelines, which go very deep, a kicking bassdrum and much more.

A great song for leaning back.
Very short, but kicking and atmospheric.


Ideas          ?        75% - very nice lines and effects
Composition    ?        60% - I miss some transitions

Breakbeat and strange sounds - that's the beginning of this tune.
Some analogs  jump around  like little frogs and finally, with the  apperance of
the fat bassdrum, we get the ultimate tripkick.
Following  is  even  some  more  bass  and  for  a  little  change  we  get very
unconventionel Analoguelines.
Even Breakbeatparts with a  total mechanic  rythm and  really amazing 303-groove
lines appear and disappear.
Fortunatly all the changes we get, fit exellent together.

Vocals, Goastuff, effex, Breakbeats, offbeat-"frogjumps" (which offer  a perfect
groove)... everything


Ideas          ?        85% - many! and good ones
Composition    ?        90% - very nice, lots of changes, that fit together
                            - nothing sounds detuned
Sound quality  ?        90% - nothing to complain again
General Kick   ?        85% - The masses  of changes can disturb, if  you listen
                              to the mod the first time
                            - for the single parts it kicks a hell.
                            - And after  having listened to it several times the
                              upper problem vanishes, too.

"FROGS WILL REIGN"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in X-Mix Volume I (1998)
Format:        GT2 (Graoumftracker)
Style:         A kind of hard or psychedelic Goa
Source:        dhs.atari.org

Hihats  are  playing  in  the beginning. Then a Bassdrum, Hihats and  some other
percussions join the nice rythm.
It's Goatime  again. A psycho-lead and some 303 samples, cutted by using the Axx
commands.
The psychedelic mood is confirmed by some echoleads later on.
The whole  track sounds  dark (if this is possible) and reminds me to the closed
ward in the old people's home I am working in.


Ideas          ?        65% - a kind of  average for  the X-mix  tracks, nothing
                              special
                            - but  some very  nice lead  effects and  percussion
                              rythms
Composition    ?        55% - Refering to the ideas, average
                            - the whole playtime the same percussions are played
                              in the  background, which  is  something  I  like,
                              maybe because it's  genious too  repeat  something
                              for minutes, without making it boring
                            - nothing sounds detuned
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        70% - it has a lot of potential to kick, but you have to
                              be in the right mood

"FUNGLE BEATS" - Theme

Author:        Comp7/Bassment
Released:      in "Fungle Beats" (demo by FUN for Quast 1998)
Format:        mod (4 Channel)
Style:         Jungle
Source:        dhs.atari.org


The music, which is  the foundation of the great timing of FUN's debut demo is a
composition of pure jungle sounds.
A quite  difficult  bassline  in  the beginning, later completed by  very breaky
breakbeats, that join the track in a cool sliding way.
The beats are well organized and not monotone at all.
Further the song also includes the typical deeptones, some analogues and several
effects.
Later some vocals are added. They say "Halleluja" several times.
The "Halleluja" represents  a kind of  orient-melody, which is something I don't
like.

The tune  consists of different parts, as in the end a very groovy part offers a
nice change.


Ideas          ?        50% - in generalery not too original, but not boring
Composition    ?        60% - there  are  different  parts, so  the  track isn't
                              monotone
                            - nothing sounds detuned
                            - the breakbeats are improvised in many ways
                            - the  vocals  do  not  really fit  and  disturb the
                              feeling of the track
Sound quality  ?        80% - ok, but I imagine to hear some noise
General Kick   ?        68% - a fat bass and cool beats make it rock
                            - not boring
                            - the vocals disturb me a lot!

"MELLOW"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in X-Mix Volume I (1998)
Format:        GT2 (Graoumftracker)
Style:         Ambient
Source:        dhs.atari.org


Ambient  is surely  the right  description  of this  song. The  typical  ambient
strings, beside  some quiet hihats. The melodypart is built by some  short piano
notes and a bassline.
I actually do not consider both, the piano as well as the bassline as blasting.
They sound a kind of unprofessionell.

The whole  track sounds  like "I have not the least motivation to compose today,
but I do it anyway".


Ideas          ?        25% - a bit dissapointing. Neither something special nor
                              something new, rather a unfinished piece
Composition    ?        35% - No changes, nothing stunning
                            - nothing sounds detuned
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        20% - of course, some  nice strings, but they get boring
                              very fast

"PLUG'N FUCK"

Author:        Dma Sc/Sector 1
Released:      for the music competition at JEM 1998
Format:        MOD (4-Channel)
Style:         Demostyle/Dance
Source:        dhs.atari.org => Dma Sc/Sector 1


The song I am speaking about is the winning module from the music competition at
JEM 1998.
The whole  track is very  Amiga demo-stylish. You get some of those Guitarleads,
soon kicked forward by a really well done Beat.
As I claimed  it to be Amigaish, it  of course  includes the  Stringaccords, the
bass and some tomdrumrolls.
The  melody itself  is nice, unfortunately  a bit quiet and sometimes  a bit too
free, in my ears.
But  the  accord  changes  are really  well  done, so  you  often  get a  really
interesting structure of accords and melody.


Ideas          ?        70% - the Amigastyle is old and a bit overused, but here
                              we have some really interesting parts as well
Composition    ?        75% - very admirable accord structures
                            - the  melody  gets  wonderful  sometimes (e.g.  the
                              first part)
                            - sometimes  I  claim  it to  sound a  little(!) bit
                              detuned (especially in the last parts)
                            - but maybe my ears are sick
Sound quality  ?        75% - partly  ordinary  4-channel  mod  quality,  partly
                              really good samples (especially the drums)
General Kick   ?        75% - a good  oldschool  track, with a  nice beat  and a
                              nice drive, too

"SQUARED CIRCLES"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in X-Mix Volume I (1998)
Format:        GT2 (Graoumftracker)
Style:         Maybe Hardhouse - what do I know..
Source:        dhs.atari.org


This track is given in different versions in X-Mix I.
"Squared Cirlces" does  not  really sound  very similar  to the "S.C. - Lifespan
edit". It is  a hard track, with  a merciless  bassline and  some  hard and  dry
drums, played in a high tempo.
Not my  personal favorite  style, but  trying to be  objective - if I  imagine a
stroposkope  and a  big party, I think  it could  be a damn  good track  for the
crowds.

For those who like dry Technostuff and for Technoparties it's a great track.
But if you want to "enjoy" music by "listening", it's the wrong thing.


Ideas          ?        70% - not too many  ideas in  here, but  the making of a
                              track, that is  usable for  a  Technoparty (in  my
                              imaginaton) is not as easy as it seems..
                              The song includes nice parts, that can make people
                              cry, while dancing..(or whatever)
Composition    ?        60% - simple, but ok
                            - cool drumbreaks to enheat the tension
                            - nothing sounds detuned
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        75% - for the ones, who  like the style, it kicks a lot,
                              for  the ones, who  don't it  kicks at  least some
                              seconds

Some very  strange and  always repeating  bass sounds introduce this  track in a
provoking way.
I love provoking stuff, which later reveals to be a high quality track.
Unfortunatly the track isn't as great as I hoped..
After a cool drumline kicked in, some analogues are discussing.
Later a  lead, which actually isn't that great (too monotone) enters  the track.
For my taste the melody is too monotone and simple.
After some  more time the lead gets a little goatouch. Nice, but not the highend
asskick.
The whole thing seems to repeat after a while, maybe with some little changes.


Ideas          ?        55% - seem to be a bit rare here
Composition    ?        50% - repetitions makes it boring
                            - nothing sounds detuned
                            - nice beginning
                            - the "Goalead" sounds to simple for Toodeloo
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        60% - for freaks maybe, not that much for me

"Throw the base" around  the snare  and get a nice breakbeat, could be  the full
name of this track.
It is a 100% electropiece. That means a simple melody and a bassline.
Then some effects and a breakbeat is added.
So this is what you get of this track, explained in a few words.
The whole  track also has  some little changes in it, but in general it is a bit
monotone after a while.
Some strings  or something like  that would have been a nice  change between all
the beats and basses.

However, for  the elektrofreaks  it surely is a  nice module, for  me it  is too
boring.


Ideas          ?        60% - One of the  first Electromods I heard, but not too
                              original in it's concept
Composition    ?        50% - the breakbeats are nice
                            - nothing is detuned
                            - I don't like the melody
                            - it is boring after a while
Sound quality  ?        80% - very clean drumsamples
                            - the leads are a bit noisy
General Kick   ?     10-80% - for those who like the style..
                     =====
                     50-67%

"YOU ARE WRONG"

Author:        Toodeloo/Dead Hackers Society
Released:      in X-Mix Volume I (1998)
Format:        GT2 (Graoumftracker)
Style:         hard but ambient?

Hardcore-fast  drums lead to  the picture of a hard track. But short  after this
introduction we can hear some nice and friendly strings - very ambient again.
The amience  is further created  by those deep tones, typical for the style, and
some little analogues.
The whole thing repeats after a short while..


Ideas          ?        70% - I like the idea of creating a divergence between a
                              very fast bassdrum and very relaxed string accords
                              at the same time.
Composition    ?        50% - very short track
                            - nothing sounds detuned
Sound quality  ?        90% - ok
General Kick   ?        60% - just a short kick, as the song is short
                        ==
                        67%

OK, that's it  for this time. In the next  issue I will also  TRY to review some

MSG/Reservoir Gods
SH3/Reservoir Gods
Mr.Future
Perkele
...



Enjoy!
