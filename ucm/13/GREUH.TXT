                           .RTS PARTY 1998 RELEASE.

                  1st Falcon Demo by Blue and Guille/Greuh!
               -----------------------------------------------

This demo  hasn't got  a name and  was made in a hurry. The demo isn't  finished
(the loader  was quickly  coded in GFA Basic, so it isn't very  efficient). It's
not a preview  because I think the main coder (BLUE) has lost his  motivation to
finish it...
But who are these coders? BLUE and GUILLE are in the crew GREUH! which is mainly
a PC crew. In fact, these two coders have created the Falcon section of GREUH!..
I don't know a lots of thing about GUILLE (except he's a  cool dude), but  I can
tell you BLUE was known on ST as BLUE BIRD/OVERLANDERS (by the way, he has coded
the Blue Bird screen in the EUROPEAN DEMOS).
Well, back to the Falcon demo. It consists in three parts:

1. The hardscrolling logo: a bouncing "Greuh!" logo  is displayed on  the screen
   while a techno sample is played. Of course, all runs in 1 VBL, even on VGA (I
   think  it's quite  impressive to  code a true colour  hardscroll  which works
   pretty well on VGA). You have to press space to run the next part.

2. A classic  mapped cube. The mapped  textures are  the "Blue" logo and a (old)
   photograph of his face. The routines seem to be fast, but that's all for this
   part!

3. Old skool rulez! Don't forget that RTS Party means "Return to The Source"!
   That's why BLUE  has coded a... ballscroller! Yeah, a good  old ballscroller,
   with a rotating effect! So  bad there is no music... a little soundchip would
   be a lot better!  :)

In  conclusion, this  demo (let's call it Blue Demo) has  got a  good  technical
level but a certain lack of design. So bad the main coder doesn't want to finish
it: at  the end  of the coding  party, he  told me: "Here is my demo, you can do
what you want with it!".

last but not least some words by moondog...

Please  let me  add some personal views  about this  demo. I was very  disturbed
about  this demo and I for myself think it isn't better than some ST releases at
all. The  first part is ok, even if there is just a logo in true color scrolling
around, accomanied by a sample sound.
But what comes next is just disappointing. The textured cube isn't  only  small,
the textures are quite simple too... no music... no design at all... BLECH!
The last part is the worst part, sorry. Even if  oldskool it's shit to release a
ball-scroller (maybe with just 2 planes, eh?!) in the year of 1998 without music
and ugly colours and last but not least on a Falcon! What the hell?!
I'm very sorry but  I can't go with The Beast's  meaning about this  demo. I was
hardly  disturbed  and I hope that the oldskool-virus will  not infect  too much
people around. This demo is just awful and not thought for watching twice!
Watch, laugh (or cry?) and delete...

over and out...
