 in the spotlight: ÛDeez of ÚMind Design  -  behind the spotlight: moondog of pod


Q: Hi Deez! Finally  it's time to direct  the UCM interview spotlight to you and
   your band! I will start with  some usual questions, even  if some people from
   the UK will be bored of them...

   How old are you and what are you doing in your real life? (Job and so on.) Do
   you have other hobbies and interests besides computing?

ÚA: Hi Eric!

Ú   I'm 22 years  old and I'm studying Computers and Telecommunication, started a
Ú   month ago. Beside  computers I'm  very interested in  movies and  esp. making
Ú   movies. I also spend alot of time watching TV and my real favourite show must
Ú   be "Friends" (correct Phoenix/Vex? :).


Q: What do you like or dislike in general?

ÚA: As most males I like good looking women and a good beer :)
Ú   Among the things  I dislike are PC's. I have one myself but  I hate coding on
Ú   them, my Falcon is much easier to use, its more straightforward.


Q: Please tell us your first steps in computing. What was your first machine and
   what do  you did with  it? Do you  started also  as gambler or did  you other
   steps at first?

ÚA: In 1988  my father bought  me a C64, since  that day  computers is  one of my
Ú   favourite hobbies. At that time I usually played games though me and a friend
Ú   did some  BASIC-stuff too. I sold the C64 and got a 520STFM in 1990. This was
Ú   a cool  machine! Lotsa (??) colors and easy to  use! At that time  I couldn't
Ú   imagine me using a C64 again, 8 years later I bought a new one :)
Ú   I started  coding asm  in 1992 or 1993 i think and  joined a few  pretty lame
Ú   crews, I also  did quite  much STOS at  that time. As  late  as 1996  I got a
Ú   Falcon and this is where I am today.


Q: What machines  do you own  and use today and what are you doing nowadays with
   them?

ÚA: Falcon - main machine, I only code on this beloved bird.
Ú   1040STFM - Play a few games from time to time.
Ú   C64 - Play games!
Ú   Playstation - Guess... :)


Q: When you discovered that there is a scene with many crazy freaks outthere and
   why you decided to join this bunch of strange people?

ÚA: Hmm.. when I started code I became interested in demos and how to make them I
Ú   joined my first REAL (??) democrew in 1993 I think, called  The Unknown Crew,
Ú   as the name  states, we were pretty unknown, we mostly coded in STOS. Later I
Ú   joined  The CyberPunks, not  very famous either, still mainly  STOS. I got to
Ú   know  The Viking  in 1993 or 1994 from  Unknown Crew  and as  we lived pretty
Ú   close to eachother (15km) we  became good  friends  and  spent  the  weekends
Ú   trying  to  release  something. We made  quite a  few  fx but  not  much  got
Ú   released.


Q: Can you  tell me more about  Mind Design, when was it formed and  where there
   other  members besides  you and  The Viking? Are there other bands you were a
   member of before Mind Design and Wildfire?

ÚA: Me and  Viking (Johan Andre) became  friends in  1993 or 1994 (see above) and
Ú   one can say that this is when Mind-design was born, we used a few other names
Ú   (none that I can remember now) and in 1996 we decided upon Mind-design..
Ú   (pretty lame name but what the heck!)
Ú   We are the only two members of Mind-design.


Q: Topic  Wildfire. As The Viking was going to the United States you joined this
   swedish demo  band. Why do you joined them and kicked Mind Design? Was it not
   possible to hold up the Mind Design label alone?

ÚA: I joined  Wildfire  because I was  very lonely :) And I  thought it  would be
Ú   easier to be  creative in a band with more than one member. If one can feel a
Ú   little  support then  its easier  to produce stuff. Too bad  Wildfire  wasn't
Ú   really the crew to give that support :(    (sorry Baggio :)


Q: Now as  The Viking  came back you left  Wildfire  again. Was it planned to be
   just a member  for the time  he wasn't there  or do you changed your mind and
   reformed Mind Design because of other reasons? If yes, just tell me!

ÚA: Viking  came back one  year earlier  than expected  so we decieded to restart
Ú   Mind-design. I didnt think much about this Wildfire-thing, and how long I was
Ú   going  to stay with  them, they weren't  very productive so I couldn't find a
Ú   reason to stay. (not that I am more productive though :)


Q: Do you still have contact to Wildfire? Is it a good one? I could imagine that
   they're not very happy because you left them alone again...

ÚA: I try to take this  scene-thing light  and so does  Baggio (Wildfire), we are
Ú   still  friends and we  had damn  fun at our QuaST-trip. If you have  ever met
Ú   Baggio then you know that this guy can be very serious :)
Ú   (Though he is a good friend).


Q: Because you're taking your projects back to Mind Design (just like your Worms
   clone) it seems  that there was no real cooperation in Wildfire. Can you tell
   me more  about the  things going  on in this band? We heard that  some people
   left the scene or were inactive.

ÚA: You answered  this question pretty  good yourself! I think that Baggio and me
Ú   were the  only ones being alive in Wildfire and there was no real cooperation
Ú   between us either, but we had pretty much fun! (and still have)


Q: Back to Mind Design. Do you had contact to The Viking as he was in the USA or
   were you surprised by his comeback to the Atari Scene?

ÚA: We didn't have very  good contact during  the year he was in USA. He  did his
Ú   thing and  I did my, so I was  very surprised  when he called me  one day and
Ú   said that he was back!


Q: You announced  several intros and demos under the Mind Design label but up to
   now  not  much happened. Do  you have  problems  in  finishing  all  your new
   projects? Is  it too much for just two members? Are you working together with
   other people from the swedish scene on this projects?

ÚA: Almost  everytime  we meet the  goal is  to finish a  project but  it usually
Ú   results  in a new project  being born. Thats  why we have  problems releasing
Ú   stuff, you  wouldn't believe  me if I  told you  how many demos  and games we
Ú   started  coding but  never finished. We also code utils  that we never use or
Ú   release :) For ex. Viking  made a complete 3D-editor for designing objects to
Ú   use in demos, its finished but we have no use for it so...


Q: As the  public will maybe  already know  MIND DESIGN  joined the  new  formed
   alliance THE LUNATIC ASYLUM. What  was the reason  to found a new alliance of
   several demo bands?

ÚA: Just a crazy idea Paranoid of Paranoia and I discussed this summer on IRC. He
Ú   asked me  if we wanted to  start this alliance with them and we did. Paranoid
Ú   came up with the name coz it suited him he said :)


Q: Can you tell us something about the current state of THE LUNATIC ASYLUM? Have
   other  bands, besides LOUD! and PARANOIA joined in? What about projects under
   this label? Is there anything planned and is there a real cooperation between
   the single members/groups?

ÚA: Sofar Lunatic Asylum consists of the crews you mentioned. I have almost dayly
Ú   contact  with Paranoid  on IRC and I hope he can draw some gfx for Armageddon
Ú   (worms) soon. I haven't been  in contact with any other member  but I hope to
Ú   meet some of them on a party or something soon.


Q: Back to  MIND DESIGN. When  we can expect  a first  playable version  of your
   Worms clone?

ÚA: Hmmm.. I will  pick up this  project tomorrow after I  finished the UCM-intro
Ú   and I will concentrate on getting this game released asap. I dont want it  to
Ú   become like many other Falcon game-projects, only a preview and nothing more.
Ú   I dont want to say a date coz then people will complain if its delayed.
Ú   (I guess you know the feeling :)


Q: Can you tell us something about your other planned releases?

ÚA: I can say that I like coding 4ks  so expect a new one. But as I  said we will
Ú   concentrate on Armageddon.


Q: Because the  most planned releases and the most stuff you  released under the
   Wildfire label too were done for Falcon, and  MIND DESIGN was before the long
   pause active on the ST I want to know if  you're planning some  stuff for the
   ST's again  or if you changed completely to  the Falcon. If the last point is
   right, just explain me why.

ÚA: We don't code for ST anymore, simple coz none of us have a harddrive to it :)
Ú   Another reason is that its easier to code on Falcon and  its possible to code
Ú   cooler things.


Q: What do you think  about the current situation of the Atari demo scene? After
   the very weak  1997 this year  it seems as there are more actions on the demo
   sector  again. What do  you think, needed the scene something like a creative
   pause?

ÚA: I think  it is very simple.. its easy to be creative if  someone else is. And
Ú   reversed  too, if noone  is creative  then why  should I? Hard to  explain in
Ú   english but...  Man fÜr mer inspiration om nÜgon annan gÜr nÜt oxo, eller hur
Ú   Evil? :)


Q: Also a special question to the scandinavian Scene. After some very weak years
   suddenly  the swedish scene  strikes back and now about  a third of  all demo
   releases coming  from your country. What the hell happened in your local demo
   scene in  the years before? Held all the people something  like a wintersleep
   or where the winters not cold enough to tie the freaks on their machines? =)

ÚA: Hehe...hard to explain, its one of natures wonders :) (got it? Nature :)


Q: As you told  me in one of your  letters you're thinking about  a scandinavian
   coding party  this autumn. Do you  have  some first  informations  about this
   party or have you cancelled this project?

ÚA: Hmm.. this info  wasn't supposed  to go  public. This partything  was not our
Ú   idea. We were  only meant to help out the main organizers. But I havent heard
Ú   from him in this matter for long so it wont happend. Again, its  not my thing
Ú   we expected to be contacted about this but we havent heard much so...


Q: OK... at next follows the strangest and latest part of the UCM interviews!
   YOU can give YOURSELF 3 questions and answer them  of course. =)  You can ask
   yourself for things no one wanted to know from you so far. JUST AN EGOTRIPP!

Ú   1. Well Fredrik, lets get down to business..
Ú      Whats your favo. music band?
Ú   A: Hmm.. hard to answer Fredrik, must be U2!

Ú   A: Well.. yes i suppose I am, i'm 192 cm tall.

Ú   3. Last one, you  are 22 yrs  now, dont you think you are getting too old for
Ú      this "demo-thing"?
Ú   A: Yes.. sad but true.. but I think I still have a few good years left!
