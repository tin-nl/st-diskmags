ò- Hello Orby, how are you?ð

Hi mOddy, my little lover! I'm fine! And you?

ò- Well, I got no sleep and I guess I need matches to hold my eyelids up.
ò  (yawn) So, are you ready for an interview?ð

I think it's a good time and by the way - I didn't sleep this night too!

ò- Okay, but before I begin with the interview, I'd like to say that it is a
ò  honour for me to have you here for a exclusive interview! You are so hard
ò  to catch in the public... Which might result of your - let's call it kind
ò  of - "delicate" business. ;)

ò  So, well, just begin with the normal (boring?) stuff: just tell me a bit
ò  your private life!ð

My real name is ñSam Tramielð. I am 21 years old - just as you are. I live in the
center of Poland in a town called Pabianice. I'm a student of informatics and
I'm going to finish the second semester.

ò-Informatics! That fits perfect to the job you're doing in the scene! I guess
ò we don't have to say what you are doing cause everyone knows, but let me ask
ò you when you started with...cracking!ð

<thinks>

...

<thinks even longer>

It was in march 1997.

ò-So that's really late! But you already had an atARi before, hadn't you?ð

Yes. I had a small atARi (8 bit) since 1985, a ST since 1990 and a Falcon
since 1995.

ò-What have you done all the time before you started cracking?ð

I collected atARi software, having about 2.000 disks with ST and Falcon-
software in the end. I always had a dream that time: to become an ñElite!ð
member someday.

ò-Hey, so you have collected a lot of stuff you could crack later on! But why
ò you started cracking then?ð

In the end of 1996 I was seeing ñElite!ð going to crash and ñVectronixð was also
going down. I remember that ñFaramir/Elite!ð wanted to kick ñPervertð and ñScorpioð
out of the crew. They left the group and I met with ñMarcerð on the IRC. I told
him to join ñElite!ð after he asked me, with the restriction ñPervertð joining in
again and ñFaramirð leaving. We had a "war" about that with ñFaramirð for about
two month. We won this battle and so I became an ñElite!ð member.

ò-May I ask you about your first crack ever? (your "first time";)ð

The first program was already cracked when I was not a member of ñElite!ð The
programm was called ó"OverLay"ð. This was in 1994.

ò-And you don't have pangs of conscience whilst cracking?ð

<makes a critical face>

<checks the phrase in an English-Polish dictionary, which he forgot at the
party later on (I hope you got it back now!)>

<makes an undescribable facial expression>

Rather not.

ò-Well, I might understand this point of view for the "commercial" productions
ò by "serious" software firms. But I have some problems with products from guys
ò that are also active in the demoscene, just like the makers of óRunningò, óCoCò
ò or óKò, just to name a few. You don't?ð

You know, I never was in the demoscene. I respect their works but I do crack
_all_ programms without splitting into kind of programms of who is my friend
and who is not. It's _not_ a business, it's just a hobby! Cracking is like an
illness for me!

ò-So what was your hardest crack up to now?ð

The hardest crack ever was óCalamus SLð. It took me one year to crack this one.
There were four protections in it and they were really hard. But while I
cracked it I realized how to crack the modules of Calamus done by ñAdequate
óSystemsð and ñDMCð. Btw, I will release a text file with a detailed description
of how to do this soon! Just watch out!

ò-Cool! And on the other hand: which was the most easiest thing to hack and how
ò long did it take?ð

I won't give any names for this, but the easiest were always shareware
programms that have the registration algorithm inside. Sometimes it even makes
registrations by itself! And those cracks take about one minute.

ò-Ohh, that's fast! I never thought that! Has a special kind  of protections
ò some higher attraction to you?ð

Hmm, I really like clever and surprising kinds of protection. (Greetings to
ñRunning Design Teamð! ;)

ò-But you managed to crack everything you wanted up to now?ð

Sure! The protections of the programms cracked by me were just lame. I removed
them all!

ò-I think that may effect from your high skills! I wonder why you are not a
ò member of a demogroup!ð

Some times ago, I wanted to create a demogroup. I wrote one demo featuring 5
screens or so, but it was never released because when I went to a computer
party kind of thing once, one dumbass did steal my disx. And guess what: he
even did steal the disk with the sources of the demo.

ò-What a pity! But you like demos in general?ð

Of course! I love them!

ò-So what are your favourite demos on ST and Falcon?ð

On ST it's óSNOWMANð and óOHH CRICKEYð. On Falcon it's óAGONYð and óDEMENTIAð.

ò-I see you don't have the latest demos for Falcon and ST!ð

No! But when I've seen these demos first, I only had a ST and so I was just
totally impressed by the stuff! And I am still!

ò-Alright. Now it's time for the famous óUnderCover-WordRap½ò, the thing in óUCMð
ò interviews that effected hard criticism by an English diskmag because the
ò answers are to predictable! I give you letters and you are answering with a
ò short sentence or word, okay?ð

Of course!

- òA-tari:ð My second real world!
- òB-reakdance:ð I saw it in holidays last year when I was in Hungary. It is a
  really great dance!
- òC-ommodore:ð SID rules
  òC-rackers:ð bad angels
- òD-iskzines:ð very needed in atARi scene
- òE-lite:ð No.1!
- òF-ALCON:ð hardcore machine
- òG-irlfriend:ð very needed but they break hearts too often
- òH-ashish:ð sometimes it good but sometimes it is very, very bad!
- òI-NTEL:ð their products can only be used inside washing machines
- òJ-AGUAR:ð I bought one some weeks ago
- òK:ð another game to crack! ;)
- òL-amers:ð groundwork of computer's world
- òN-etscape:ð the best webbrowser on PC
- òP-laystation:ð the best game machine so far
- òQ-uaST:ð nice Polish atARi club and the party is pretty good!
- òR-UNNING:ð it's cracked - but not trained yet!
- òS-pagetthi:ð my mother cooks the best in the world!
- òU-FO:ð I am waiting for their arrival
- òV-iagara:ð when I get it I have unlimited energy (for cracking)
- òW-INDOWS:ð there are 13 of them in this room!
- òX-XX files:ð I never saw xrated pictures of Mulder and Scully...
- òZ-aphod Beeblebrox:ð Coolest guy I know.

ò-So the last question: What do you think about óUndercover Magazineò?ð

It's good but:

  1. it has an unreadable interface
  2. it's not working with my Falcon monitor
  3. more musics are needed!
  4. all Moondog's works are _shit_! (his opinion about scene is too negative)

ò-Okay Orby, that's it! Anything you'd like to say to the crowd out there?ð

I just want to say that I love atARi and  all atARi scene - and of course you,
mOddy!

ò-Cheerio!ð

Bye!
