ó                       GERMAN SCENE REPORT - AUTUMN 1998
ò--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok... another  issue of the UCM - another volume of  the german scene report. At
the moment the things  slowing down here in Germany but of course there is still
something going on... The problem at  the moment is that  there are just  a very
few releases from german bands around in the last half year... so it's again and
again the same question: Are they still alive?!
The activities  of the whole german scene are  consisting more of  rumours as on
real releases. In the  last half year just ó.tSCc.ð, óESCAPEð and óCHECKPOINTð matched
it to bring us some stuff on the demo sector and óPARANOIAð on the games sector.
All others  is uncertain, no one know's really what's  going on and  there is no
one too who gives  concrete informations. Meanwhile  other local  scenes bombing
around with  many releases the  germans shining with  absence. Just a few single
actions, of some  more or less freelancing musicians and  graficians  holding up
the flagg of the german demo scene.
Because of this problem this scene report  will look a bit strange because I can
not give you very precise informations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ó... CHECKPOINT ...

The last release of this band was done about 7 months ago, it was just the ñUCM11
intro. Rumours say that they're still working on a music demo, called ñMODULATION
TWOð but no one has seen just a single bit of it so far.
Another big project was denied (erm... ok, we start a campaign of desinformation
now...). ò5o5ð (their musician) is helping out others with his  tracker- and chip-
musics, just like the ñUCMðs, óLOUD!ð and the óMYSTIC BYTESð.
-update- òDEFJAMð  released a 128 byte  intro called ñ"HUNT FOR FUJI"ð in  September
         and another one in the first days of October.

ó... CREAM ...

Nothing released  for months now... but the  rumours about their  coming ST demo
don't break for just one week. Maybe it is nearly  finished, maybe not. The most
active people are, without any doubt, òTAOð and òAGENT Tð. Meanwhile their own óCREAM
projects are  suffering under the slowness of  the coders they  supporting other
people with sounds and grafix, just like projects of óWILDFIREð, óAVENAð and óOXYGENE
(just to mention a few...).


ó... ESCAPE ...

Of course still  here and the only german band who released a bigger  demo since
the ñINTERJAM'98ð Party  5 months ago. The most actions were  done by òNOð. There is
nothing known about the other member, òSAGEð.


ó... I.C.S. ...

Hu? Still around? Yes... òSKINHEADð is still working  on the second  volume of his
ñATARI ST PIRATE GOLD CD ROMð... He just reached the 2oo MB and needs support!


ó... PARANOIA ...

This new band is still active  but their  promised "scene game" doesn't  hit the
drives of our machines  so far. Even if they have founded the  new alliance "THE
LUNATIC ASYLUM" there  isn't much in the  pipeline. òTHE PARANOIDð is  working for
FUN's new game now and released a small fake demo for ST.


ó... POETS OF DECAY ...

Yep... we're still here too and be sure... we will not give up in the next years
and reach the  next millenium with the UCM! =) But as  it seems the  UCM will be
the only release under the this label for the next time... no coder = no demo =(


ó... PSYCHONOMIX ...

Ha! Is there anyone around who remembers this band?! Back in 1993 they did a big
demo on the ST and the last survivors were seen on the  ñFRIED BITS 1995ð  and the
ñSYMPOSIUM 1996ð. Meanwhile there were rumours that they quitted the scene at all.
No, not quite right! òTEKIð opened  an own BBS, the óPSYCHONOMIX PHUN CENTERð, a new
german  scene BBS... a very  good job for  the starving  german scene  since the
óJUNCTION BBSð is going down...
Unfortunately there aren't more actions planned.


ó... RUNNING DESIGN TEAM ...

They released the level editor for their great 3D shooter, but  on the PC, grrr.
Therefore they're still working on the multi-player-version of the game, even if
some crackers are damaging their motivation with the hack of ñRUNNINGð.


ó... STAX ...

Nothing seen since March now. There are some rumours  about unfinished demos and
a comeback demo around but I believe only in the things I can see...


ó... THE CHAOS ENGINE ...

No demostuff in sight... therefore the  second volume of òTHE BYTEð's FALCON POWER
CD was released in June. There is nothing  more known  about the  rumours around
their old coder òbITmASTERð. He's doing a Atari chipsound demo for the PSX...


ó... .tSCc. ...

Still around  but suffering under the lazyness of  their coders. Anyway òDYNACORE
managed  his comeback and also òLLAMAð is  still active, but  it takes  a horrible
long time to see something finished at all by them.
Latest releases were done 5 months ago and future projects are very uncertain.
Therefore  they supporting  other projects  too, just like  stuff by  the óMYSTIC
BYTESð, óAVENAð, óOXYGENEð and others.


ó... VECTRONIX ...

The "german section" is  suffering under the hardware crashs of all the members.
They're only cracking on PaCifiST now because all  VEX Falcons burned  away. But
it seems as they don't want to  quit so fast. òSTRATAGEMð released also the second
volume of the ñVECTRONIX CDð...


Hmmm. That's it I think. I don't know  what happened  to óCRUORð or  even óTHERAPYð.
All others are as dead as the death itself I think.
Ok. The german scene community is still bigger as I thought but without a better
cooperation I don't think that the things will going better in the next time.
So guys! As written on  another point in this magazine I'm planning to go online
this year. With the time I will try to contact  everyone and maybe  there is the
possibility for a better coordination and cooperation which will help the german
scene to survive. Ok, just wait for my mails...
