"NARSIL" isn't a new diskmag and I think  some of you may remember the info that
there is  existing a magazine in the Czech Republic for years. Finally I got the
latest issue of them, the first time for me...

It was  released in  June by the czech  band FAEN and some other  Atari fanatics
from Bohemia... so the whole  shell was coded by  EMPTY HEAD of HEADACHE PROJECT
and I  think  this name is even in the "old" Atari countries wellknown  for some
demos and also games releases.

I was very surprised about this because I thought Poland has the only real local
scene in "eastern" Europe. But it seems to be the same problem there as with the
polish scene, no  one in "western" Europe knew  anything about  them, it doesn't
matter why.
Alone the  fact that it  is the 26th issue shows that they  must be active for a
long time now. Ok, enough craptalk. Lets go over to the real facts...

"NARSIL" runs on every ST or Falcon (erm, I think so). After loading the mag (it
is about  550 KB without  the stuffs) some nice drawn pictures  appearing on the
screen and a lot of czech stuff too.

Before the mag starts you have to type in the registration code and here we have
the  first  negative  point. "NARSIL" is  some  kind of  shareware. You  have to
register to get the full ammount  of articles and  for not czech speaking people
it's a bit  worthless to get hold of the mag if they can't check it  out without
limits.

Ok, after passing  the check some  adverts for  several games (the  last more or
less  professional  games for ST, like "ULTIMATE ARENA" or "ALIEN THING" and the
EMPTY HEAD  production "POWER UP" (do you remember our review?!)) coming  up and
finally the shell was build up on the screen.
It's a nice looking one, no question... just a screenshot?!

{*i narsil1.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

There  you can  chose the articles with  the cursor  keys. It doesn't scroll the
menu, it's just  changing  the  pages. After  loading an  article  the  shell is
disappearing and  you will see the article, without  any control panel  or so on
the  screen. Several articles feature also screenshots or just other grafix like
boxes for  the ratings in games or simple coloured bars as  frontier between the
several  parts of an article. When you  enter an article  the whole  thing looks
like this...

{*i narsil2.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

But also  here no scrolling is included  and the articles  are displayed page by
page. Not bad at all but also a bit too simple.

The articles featuring stuff like  reviews of (old!) games, some stuff about the
czech  Atari world (I think so?!), news and all the stuff. Unfortunately I don't
speak any  czech word and  can't say  anything about the quality of the articles
and the contents of all...

But let  me come back to  the problem with the shareware. As said  above you can
not load  all articles if you're  not registered. I think about the  half of the
included 24 articles is only for  those lucky  guys and when you try to load one
of  them a  picture  appears, just saying  that you  have to  be registered  for
enjoying the text...
Ok. More to say? Hm... I don't know, it seems  that there is  music included but
I didn't hear any sound, perhaps only on STE and Falcon?

The articles  are (besides  the problem  that they're written in czech only) not
very actual, the tested software is simply too old (games from the eighties...).
There isn't too much to read at all.

The packed stuff is a bit senseless for me, it's just the ripped intro of a game
and the  animation sequence  of "CHAOS STRIKES BACK". Is there any need for this
stuff? I don't think so... but it's my private meaning.
The mag itself  is easy  to control, the outfit  of the  menu isn't  bad and the
including of screenshots nice too.

Conclusion: Positive is  to have another magazine  on the  Atari scene, which is
            nice  presented. Negative  is the  limitation to  the  czech people,
            it's nice for them, but  why not  including  some english  stuff too
            for the  readers in whole Europe?! Esp. today all should be done for
            supporting  the Atari scene  at all... Ok, for the czech people it's
            some kind of necessary but  no one will be interested in the mag and
            perhaps in supporting it from other countries...

UPDATE.. in late september I got issue 27, and it's the registered version. So I
had could read the whole ammount of articles but hey... I still don't speak just
one czech word =(
Therefor I had the possibility to check out that the mag offers  on STE tracker-
music... unfortunately the STf don't got any new features, still no music at all
and this is shit but seems to be the latest trend, eh?
But the  grafix of the menu have made  a big jump! Nice drawn  stuff, giving the
whole magazine some space ambience...
After all  there isn't much to talk about  the ratings given above... maybe some
points more for the shell but that's it...
