óTrader 2ð - òCroft Soft [STOS]ð 1996-1998 ñ(Any Atari with STOSFix)ñ

òCroft Softð presented Trader 2 early 1998. A bit funny is that the copy
includes a copy of STOS, as the programmer didn't use the compiler but the
"save "NAME.PRG" command of STOS. So every STOS owner can run this game
using the original basic on his computer, Non-STOS owners might need STOSFix
by Robert Quezeda or GenFix by Anthony Jacques/Les Greenhalgh.

Basically, this game is identical with ñ"Der Patrizier"ð by óAscot softwareð.
You are in command of several ships - of course you start with just one -
a crew and the main topic of the game is to trade, to deliver goods and of
course to defend your cargo and wealth against evil pirates.
This is all done using the mouse and an icon-system. You start in a screen
enabling you to buy ships, cargo, weapons, recruit crewmen or print
Informations about either you or your opponents. Yes, you can even direct
the output to the printer, unfortunately, the program crashes if none is
connected. However, you can of course also view the information or the
opponents on screen. Finally, when clicking the sail-button, you can select
the destination on a small map which also features the font of the
original ñ"Der Patrizier"ð.
During the journey, you may run into pirates. You can then select between
retreat or attack. Retreat can fail in some cases if your opponents have 
fast ships, which means you will be drawn into the battle though. If you
choose attack, the computer will calculate the odds and present the result,
you may lose ships and cargo this way.
Additionally, some "random events" can happen, influencing the gameplay or
rather your situation more or less directly. Another feature is what òCroft
Softð calls dynamic economies. This of course enhances the simulation as your
trading more or less affects the economy, so that you may have to change
strategy, give up on some trading routs and try to discover alternatives.

If you know the game ñ"Der Patrizier"ð, you may have read a description of it
above, óTrader 2ð and ñDer Patrizierð are very similar.
Unfortunately, Trader 2 can not cope with the style and the design of ñDer
Patrizierð. òCroft Softð may have put a lot of emphasis in the economy-
simulation, but the rest of the gameplay lacks design and originality. The
icons are very simple, the game features neither sound nor music.
Okay, this may not be this important for a simulation like this, but it would
have improved the gameplay a little.

The result in this case does not look too friendly. Trader 2 may be a good
economy simulation, but it is too dry to be more attractive than the original
ñ"Der Patrizier"ð, which features an identical gameplay, but is presented so
much better, does not lack the economical details and specifics either. 
óTrader 2ð is not a bad game, but after all, we have 1998, and therefore i
would have expected a little more.
