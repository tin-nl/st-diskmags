The intro  of the "ModCompil 14" is this  time from  LLAMA and its  main effect,
after a gag (insert coin), voxelspace, is pretty  smooth and coloured very nice.
text display is a bit fuzzy then of course, but very well readable.
Astonishing, to  what limits LLAMA  pushes the ST here  in a "simple" intro. The
main  text is  displayed in  front of  a kind of mosaic  plasma effect in a dark
brown and looks pretty nice without interfering the background.
Pretty good for an intro for this purpose.

The Tunes
  
crickey.mod
You may have guessed it, this is the mod from the most famous TLB production on
the  ST, "OOH CRICKEY! WHAT A SCORCHER". It  really is  the  original  version,
converted  by SCY and it  does sound excellent, a bit better than the original,
but this is   due to the better replay frequency of the SIRIUS PLAYER.
Definetly one  of the highlights  of this compilation, although it is somehow a
"cover-version". ;-)
  
reset.mod
This is  the Mod version  of tune  played during  the  reset  demo  of the demo
mentioned  above. Again, it  is the original  tune, converted from the original
Quartet format (invented by the LOST BOYS) to the more convenient mod-format by
SCY/.tSCc. This tune is not as fascinating as the main theme, it lacks a bit of
originality, but it still is nice though.
A bit "old-school", but nevertheless very entertaining.
  
systems.mod
What a difference  between the 2 mods mentioned above and this one. This one is
quite  monotone, a bit  confuse and  suffers from  an extreme  lack of  melody.
Although I am  pretty sure that  this is exactly  what it was supposed to be, I
wouldn't  recommend it  though. It develops  far too  slowly, features  far too
little variation and sometimes sounds like an error in the soundchip.
I know that this is all intented this way, but even in this case I am afraid it
could have been done better.
Not bad for people  enjoying a weird  mixture of Gabber without a bassline, too
fast doomtech  or terror without  the deep  bass, but I  personally don't think
it's going to find many friends.
  
varghrmx.mod
Another contrast to  the last mod. This one is rather slow and not depending on
the fast drumset. However, it  is dark and gloomy, not  very fast, but not very
groovy  either. It is not  easy to identify  either, it's neither doom-tech nor
real trance, although Trance fits closest in my eyes.
People who like slow, gloomy tunes developing very slowly but consequently will
definetly like it.

xdream.mod
This  one is  a complete  different  style than  anything  on this  compilation
before. It is -to put  it in one  word- quite  cute. A kind of happy music, but
very well  staying in a  rather classic mod style. Not very melodius, but quite
flexible and therefore rather entertaining.
A happy experience.
  
zf2.mod
Well, back to  the classic mod style. Reminding  of good old RED SECTOR screens
on the Amiga and  the first Mod-tuned demos on the ST, this sounds pretty good.
The development of the  tune is very transparent, it follows quite closeley the
old-school  mod style. It is very entertaining and variable though, featuring a
nice drumtrack and a nice bassline.
Very classic, but also very good.
  
zf3.mod
In case you wonder, this one was used for the game "ZERO 5" for STE and Falcon.
And like in the  game, this Mod is EXCELLENT. Starting with a great, boombastic
clash, then suddenly  breaking into  a completely different, metallic  sounding
theme and then  slowing down into a rather smooth, but a bit dangerous sounding
theme. This tune is excellent and also an evergreen as well.
The definite highlight on this compilation in my eyes.
  
zf4.mod
This one  is a bit  similar to  the zf2.mod  but does  not reach  its class. In
contrast to the zf2.mod, it lacks of melody and is a bit more confuse than this
one. It  is a  bit  darker  although  it follow  the  same  style  with  a good
drumpattern  and a nice  bassline, but the  main voice  does not develop such a
clear theme than in zf2, and the variability is more or less limited to pattern
without a either a bassline or without a drumtrack.
Not bad, this tune, but not too exciting.

The intro, this  time from  DYNACORE, requires  an STE this  time, but it looks
terrific. A smooth  1 plane zoomer  in front  of a nice  graphic by mOd, a cool
mixture of  plasma-effect and  rotative synchro zoomer in the background of the
main scroller  and also a nice, pretty weird effect behind the main text of the
Mod-compil.
Well, the intro is  excellent and pushes the STE to the limit. The music sounds
terrific, according  to MC LASER it's  an unreleased  tune  by  MAD MAX, STE is
needed for the blitter mainly.
  
The tunes

4_DRYEGG.MOD
This  one is  typical  MC LASER  style. It's  awfully  long  and  also not very
variative. However, it  was meant as  background  music for the  game "DRY EGG"
from FOUNDATION TWO - and it  fulfills the  duty excellently. The music  is not
terrific when listening to it doing nothing else, however, as  background music
during working on the computer, it is quite nice.
Not his best tune, but not bad either.
  
NOISE.MOD
Very short, only  6 positions  short, this music  is quite  good, but of course
rather short. A  nice tune, but of course it only features one theme and that's
it.
  
UCM9.MOD
Again, this  is a long mod. Over  70 positions  to play and the  music features
several themes  and some rather drastic  changes without  changing  the overall
style of  the tune. It is  quite slow and  the variations are  coming in rather
large terms, which makes this music sometimes a bit boring.
Again, as a background tune, it does excellently, but I miss some variation for
stand-alone-listening.
  
UCM10.MOD
And another  extremely long  mod. It is  in style  quite similar to UCM9, but I
like  it  a bit  better  than  the  UCM9.MOD. It  is  more  flexible, sometimes
switching between  several themes without creating large gaps. Again, the music
is of a rather dark style and might sound a bit "depressing" at some stages.
This was  intended to  be played  in the background  of UCM 10 and that it does
very well. Just to listen to it is a bit dull however.
  
Note from the reviewer.
  
It is always  difficult to  review music as music is always a question of taste
and -not that I would have any- taste is something that is easy to argue about.
I can only try to  describe to the  tunes, but for a real judgement, you should
listen to them yourself. ;-)
