Úcontents:    I. The usal blah-blah

            II. And the winner is... - results of volume's 7 competition

           III. Atari GFX scene report part I

            IV. Short design and art critiques of recent demos by Escape and
                Mystic Bytes


ÚI. The usual blah-blah

Ongawonga mates, here's  ÒmOd again with  another  issue of  the ÛaRt fACtORy, the
computer  art-corner of ÛUnderCover Magazine. This time I had a little motivation
gap, thus you  might not find  the promised "how  to paint  motives"-tutorial in
this issue.

But nevertheless I have prepared a quite interesting  main-part  about the Ústill
Úactive gfx man on atARi ST and Falcon. Due to the fact it is  quite hard  to get
precise information about any of the painters, I will subdivide this report into
two parts.

On the  other hand, there  is also a new section in this  aRt fACtORy in which I
give  my  Úcomments  about  the  artistic   quality  of  some  recently  released
Úproductions. Of course this  is only a very subjective view, but I  always liked
to do something like that...

So have fun reading!



ÚII. Results of the competition

The  competition  in ÛaRt fACtORy VII was  to tell  me where  the saying  that is
shown on the loader-screen of the magazine comes from and how the next  lines of
this text  are. The text  said "ÚI got  sunshine in  my  stomach"  and the  price
should be a logo painted by me for your crew.

And what  can I say? I was  really  surprised  by the load of right  answers and
answers in general I got.

To be precise, there was only ÚONE answer, and this one wasÚ RIGHT.

It was from ÒDeez/MIND DESIGN, who was  telling me that  this saying is part of a
song  by  ÒGENESIS  called "ÚIn  The Cage" from  their  double-album "ÛThe Lamb Lies
ÛDown On Broadway", released  in 1974. The next  lines of the song  where "like I
just rocked my baby to sleep - I got sunshine in my  stomach - But it can't keep
me from creeping sleep - deep, deep in the deep".

So ÒDeez/MIND DESIGN is the winner of the competition and gets the logo!

Congratulations?!

It seems  that  all the other  people around  did not  have any  interest in the
competiton, just did  not know where  to find the  saying or  maybe they  have a
good graphic artist at hand, so they don't need the price.

Hehe.



ÚIII. atARi gfX sCEne REPORt pARt I

When I  checked out Ò5o5's "ÚatARi TRACKER  SCENE REPORT" in  ÛUnderCover  magazine
12, I was  kind  of fascinated  by the idea  of making a list of all  the people
who are making musics  on ÚatARi. It is a very good  way to  get a fast  overview
of who is still alive, what he is doing and how to get in contact.

So I decided  to create  this  text, representing  a list  of all still  more or
less  active  ÚatARi  gfx men. There are both ÚatARi ST and  ÚatARi Falcon painters
in this list. Of course it doesn't claim to  be complete, but  if I find out new
gfx men, they will be surely added to this list.

So let's start with...

nick: ÒST Survivor
crew: ÒLoud!

 Former  known as  ST Survivor of  NO LIMIT CODING (NLC), this  painter  already
appeared with  graphics  in some  issues  of French diskmagazine "TOXIC MAG". He
also created the gfx for "Trace", a very nice  tron-clone on ST and for "Back in
France", an  outstanding  GFA-basic  demo by  NLC, released  at JEM '98 (GIGAFUN
'98).

 ST Survivor uses CrackArt  on his 520 STE. He  was also  the  translator of the
French CrackArt manual!

 He is surely the most promising painter from  France in this  scene nowadays. I
am looking forward to see more works by him in further French productions.

      ÒAvena

 Maybe today's most  famous and controversial artist on atARi, a-t- is with  his
27 years also the oldest painter around.

 Entering  the atARi ST-scene  in 1990/91, he made graphics and  some sounds for
a whole bunch of ACF productions, which  was his first group, too. Do  you still
remember the fine work  he did for "Just Buggin"? Really outstanding stuff  this
is!

 Sometime  between '93 and '94 he  left ACF and  joined CREAM. In 1994  he got a
Falcon  and  participated in  several  demos, such  as AVENAs "Dementia" (1994),
"Enrage!"  (1995)  and  "Sonolumineszenz"  (1997). Besides  that, he  also  made
graphics for  CREAMs "Songs that  make us go hmmm 2" (1996, ST) and  appeared in
all gfx-competitions on atARi-parties.

 He achieved a 3rd place at Fried Bits II (1994), first place  at Fried Bits III
(1995), first place at Symposium '96, 3rd place gfx-compo and first place in the
render-compo at SiliConvention '97. As you can see, he is pretty successful.

 His latest appearances  were in  MYSTIC BYTES' premiere  smash  demo  "TimeOut"
(1998) and its successor "TearDrop" (1998). Rumours saying that  he  is  working
on graphics for OXYGENE's new  ST demo "Nostalgic-O" (worktitle) and for AVENA's
next Falcon production.

 A-t- uses DPaint ST  when he paints  16 color graphics, EscPaint  for >16 color
gfx  (he  used  IndyPaint  in  former  times) and  some  professional  rendering
software on PC.

 Last but  not least he  wrote the monthly "Falcon scene"-article  in commercial
German atARi magazine "ST Computer/ATARI Inside" since spring 1994 up  to August
1998 (it seems as this scene corner is stopped now).

 Rumours as  supposed  in MAGGIE and  spreading  around at QUAST  party,  saying
that there is some kind  of rivalry between  him and the editor of  this article
are pure  bollocks. We have a very  friendly mail contact  from time to time and
a very  high respect for the works each other did. (at  least me ;) We only make
digs  against us, having  fun about this  and getting  motivated  more and more.

 Besides, the rumour-spreading  dudes will be quite  astonished about  what will
happen in some months. No more hints about this atm.

 A very  talented graphic  artist, who was working for a  long time unrecognized
from the rest  of the scene. Until 1997  he only  painted  on ST  with CrackArt,
later  he  got a Falcon.  Unfortunately  his  machines  are  more  damaged  than
working, so there are not a lot of new graphics by him.

If he works on Falcon, he uses EscPaint.

 The  graphics  I've seen  from  him are  just  brilliant:  fullscreen-pictures,
amiga-conversions  and a  lot of motives in only 16 colors. The last  officially
known works by him were released in NAUGHTY BYTES' "Lasse Reinbîng".

 At SiliConvention '97 graphics competition he released a Falcon  picture called
"Give ur baby a joint", showing  mother bear giving her baby some weed to smoke.
Afaik this was his first picture with more than 16 colors done by him.

 At InterJam '98 he  showed  some  new  graphics  which  looked quite promising.
Hopefully they will be released sometime.

 ...is the present  girl-friend of CHECKPOINT member  JOE COOL. You may  already
have recognized that in her nickname, meaning "darling" in German language.


 She doesn't  own an atARi  or an other computer, but paints occasionally at her
friend's Falcon. In fact I  have only seen  one picture  by her, showing  a logo
saying  Joe Cool. This  one was presented  at  InterJam's  graphics-competition.
Some might  say it's fake, I say it's lack of experience. So  paint on and leave
out those fucking pure blue colors!

 update: I heard  people saying I should not count her in this  list of gfx man.
I did it  nevertheless, cause  I want  to  give  you a  more  or  less  complete

 I started  painting in  spring 1992 with  Deluxe Paint and NeoChrome on ST. But
soon I realized that  a realtime  zommer is not my  thing... After playing a bit
around with other graphic programms  and even coding a lot of stuff with Omikron
Basic, my beloved  CrackArt hitted  me on April, 16 1993. My  heart  still beats
faster when I think of that rainy afternoon  when I started this art package for
the first time. It was love  first sight!

 My nick  changed  from "Master  of Dynamite"  to M.O.D., then  to Mod, MOD  and
finally to mOd  which is  the only right  way of  spelling  it. (Boring  and not
interesting stuff you say? Well, you  might be  right, but some people  asked me
for it and so I thought it is a good place to add it here...)

 In late 1992 I  got in contact  with  jMS of  ANIMAL MINE, who was  a young but
(already) great  painter in  the ST scene. After  some  time  I did  show him my
works and  he gave me  a lot of hints  and tips how to improve. He even  sent me
all his graphics, being some kind of happy having found a "student".

Retrospectivly I  have to  admit that he taught  me the fundamental  parts of my
nowadays  skills. You may  realize that  in some  older works  of mine, where my
style was quite similar to that of jMS.

 And due  to this fact I was so motivated and inspired that  I painted about 25o
logos and  other stuff  till midth of 1995 and collected skills  and experience.
Most  of  the  pieces  from this  time were real  shit. (hehe, the  beloved  UCM
language, here  it  is  again...   But  serious,  the  gfx  were  really  bad in
comparison to the later stuffs)

 I  joined tnb, THE NAUGHTY BYTES, in october 1993 and made some  first gfx that
were also used in productions. In July '95 I stopped painting  due to my service
at the worst bunch of buttmonks you've ever seen: the German army.

 Until June '96 I was  totally out  of ideas because  of the bad surroundings at
army. But in  late 1996 I reentered the  scene, joining .tSCc. in  january 1997.
(ahem, if you really wanna know: I got one inch taller because of this! ;)

 I still use CrackArt  for 16 colors-pictures  and EscPaint for  graphics having
more  than 16  colors. (okay, that doesn't  happen to often) I paint  mostly  on
Falcon with CrackArt v1.35.

 My role model is NikO/ex-MJJ^PULSE and partly a-t-/CREAM (gosh, I don't like to
do gfx for the scene anymore when I am 27! Respect! Hehe...)

 I  had   graphical  appearances  in  productions  of  tnb,  several  issues  of
UnderCover  Magazine, .tSCc.  module  compils,   MYSTIC  BYTES' "TearDrop"  demo
(1997) and  in a  lot of  still unreleased  demos by several  crews (CHECKPOINT,
STK/.tSCc., AVENA, MB).

 Besides that  I have  the feeling  of being the laziest and most boring painter
in the scene.

Anything missing? Hmm?

Ú<a lot of voices around shouting:>

 "He was  the  only atARi artist besides  2o aMiGA- and pC-painters who did take
part in the QUAST '98  truecolor  graphics  competition  and made  the 1st place
with a picture of German europop-queen 'BlÅmchen'."

 Primary  he is a  coder, who is  grabbing the  digital brush  from time to time
due to the lack of graphicians around. The results of is work are  quite amazing
for a programmer!

 His work  first  appeared in  ESCPAEs music-disk "MODULATION" in  late 1997. It
reached  its  full  bloom  in ESCAPEs  next  sounddisk "MODULATION 3" with  nice
design and  windows. Latest  appearance was an logo for his own group, shown  in
avantgarde demonstration ILLNESS AT NIGHT (...), released at QUAST '98.

 Besides he is  also the  maker of Escape Paint, maybe the best  Falcon gfx-tool
ever.

nick: ÒVulgar
crew: ÒMystic Bytes

 He was member of CONFUSIONS before  he joined MYSTIC BYTES in  late 1997. There
had been several appearances of his graphics in CNF-productions. Just  check out
his very nice  AMOK logo  in the  beginning of the really  not so cool demo with
the same name, released in 1997.

 Unfortunately  the best works  he did for CNF were not  used so far. So you can
wait for  some  excellent  art in  the forthcoming CONFUSIONS  stuffs - if there
will be any.

 He had an entry at  QUAST party  1997 in Orneta, showing  a kneeling blue human
being with  a red background. For  MYSTIC BYTES' second demo TEARDROP he did the
TEARDROP logo and coloured the strange  signs that are shown at the beginning of
the production and which  were done by the editor of this article in  a state of
overfatigue at a big Polish party...

 Besides, long haired  VULGAR  has a ST  and a F ALCON both  and likes  to paint
with the  outstanding art-package  CRACKART in 16 colors  and RAINBOW and ESCAPE
PAINT whilst painting in more than ST low. Astonishingly he  seems to got it how
to use RAINBOW MEDIA in  a way to  get good results. I wonder how much time this
might have taken... ;)

 As far as  I've seen it  at QUAST  party, VULGAR is one of the  most productive
graphic  artists  of  the scene - with  the lowest  amount  of  releases, as  it
seems. I've  seen a thousands  of  pictures  done by  him on his harddisk drive.
Even if he said  that a lot of  them are  only "preview  versions  of the  final
pictures", you  will still  count at least 300 to 400  pictures. And I undoubtly
like them!

 VULGAR can paint logos and  motives both in a fine manner. And  after some time
of  lazieness  during  the last month he is  back to bring  some fresh air  into
Polish productions...

nick: ÒSpearhead 3 (short: SH3 or Kev D)
crew: ÒReservoir Gods


 Spearhead 3 - or better: SH3 - is  one  of the  few well known  British graphic
artists in the atARi scene.

 He started  painting  with  his ST 6  month after  he got the machine  in 1988.
First works were done using NeoChrome and Degas Elite. He  did  send some of his
works to British ST magazines ST  Format and ST User, which  printed - following
his words - "loads of stuff" by him.

 Soon Ruthless of AWESOME asked him  to join the crew and so he did. He  went to
HOTLINE UK, QUARTEX  and  TEKNNIX. Astonishingly, he  even  joined  the  Finnish
group ADMIRABLES, who  were  quite famous for their disk  magazine called EYE ON
SCENE. Finally he also joined English menu group LEMMINGS.

 When he got  his Falcon  he joined  RESERVOIR GODS, which  is still  his actual
band.

 Nowadys SH3  mainly paints  on Falcon with  GODPAINT, a programm  his groupmate
Mr. Pink  did. He  escpecially likes to  do logos, but as we  can see in some of
the latest RG productions, he is also quite good in painting motives.

 For  painting he  uses the awful atARi mouse (hmm, a-t- does  this as well, and
I really don't understand dudes using it...;) and always listens to  some drum &
bass musics, which give him the right athomsphere for inspirations.

 SH3 is a  very productive  artist. I heard  he has  done hundreds  of logos and
other stuff. Besides he is also making music on his Falcon o30.

...that's it for the first part of the list. You can read the second  part of it
in the next issue of this or an other  magazine. But it's  not really  sure that
there will be a second part in general.

Ú/me is pretty lame these days...



ÚIV. Short design and art critiques of recent demos

Okay, here is  a new part of the aRt fACtORy. I will review some demos and other
productions for  the artistic- and design-side. Before reading this reviews, you
should check out the normal review in the demo-corner of UnderCover.

You will  recognize  that it is  mostly  some quite  hard  criticism. I will not
exclude my own works from  this. And all of  you that might  cry  out loud after
reading the reviews of your productions, keep this in mind:

ÚSerious meant criticism is a way to improve skills.

I will  discuss  with you about your  opinions of my  critiques but  I will just
laugh if  you simply  want to offend or  insult me afterwards. (remember the old
German saying that "Hitted dogs are barking"?)

Again: please keep that in mind.

Alright. This  time  I've  choosen  two  productions  about  which  I can  write
something. Most  of the  nowaday's  productions  don't  fit in  here  cause they
simple don't  have any design  or style  and simply  don't want it. This  sounds
hard, but it's right.

So, here we go with the critiques...


- ÒESCAPE: Û"Illness At Night And Shackled Sheep"

  Hard to  understand  when  you see it  for the  first  time, but  great  after
  you've  checked  it  at  least  twice. No  outstanding or even  good graphics,
  but a veryfine presentation.

  I liked the crazieness of the effect. The colorful plasmas in  the second part
  were  timed very  good to the music. There is no critizism from  my side about
  the second part. Well done!

  The last effect was  shocking, but  something  completly new and  outstanding.
  Respects for this. The music must get a special  praise, due to the  fact it's
  not the old fashioned melody- or techno-style, but pleasingly different.

  Unfortunately  there was  no "red threat" which  could have been  seen through
  all the  parts. The whole bunch of effects were simply  putted together, timed
  to the music of course, but  without any  connection  between  them. The  blue
  background  of the  text-part in  the beginning  should have been shown in the
  left and right border as well. Else it  looks not  too cool in connection with
  the plasma-effects afterwards.

  The end  of the  third  part is not  too good  timed, because  when the music-
  sample  is fully  over, some  last red  parts of the zoomer of the  fat lady's
  picture  are  still  display. In  this situation  there  should  not have been
  anything on the screen at all.

  The credits screen is totally out of question  and shouldn't be justified with
  some kind of tradition from "ÛSili Con Carne"-demo.

  All in all ÒESCAPE  are going into  the  right  direction and  they  bring some
  fresh air into design and demo-art.

  ÚRating: [7/10]


- ÒMYSTIC BYTES: Û"Teardrop"

  Good demo, surely  not as  good  as  their first production "ÛTime Out". A very
  fast thing with some design.

  The effects are mainly not shown  too long, but the effects that are shown are
  nearly always the same. Tunnels are  kind of old-fashioned  now. Same goes for
  bumpmappers.

  The colors  of the  tunnels  and other  effects are choosen  wisely. Maybe the
  green texture in the part where textures are moving from right  to the left is
  unsuitable.

  ÒMYSTIC BYTES used  very good  and not seen so  far link-effects  in this demo.
  Nice to look at!

  Especially I like  the parts  when they move the whole screen  around for only
  some pixels (e.g.  when the  Mystic Bytes-logo is shown) or when  they show an
  effect that runs and suddenly starts at an other position  on the screen (e.g.
  the tunnel after the zooming blue Mystic Bytes-logo).

  The sense  of the  peculiar signs at the beginning is  ununderstandable. Their
  red color on  black background sucks in my opinion. A bit  more sensitivity in
  choosing colors would be great.

  I could discuss the quality of a-t-'s Mystic Bytes-logo, but I won't.

  The music is  fast  and  stylish, but a bit  less melody would  fullfill it as
  well.

  ÒMYSTIC BYTES did  not took  the chance creating  more lensflare-effects in the
  style of the one in "Time Out".

  The big  drawn picture is  shit. On  the one  hand it  is shown  in  70% JPEG-
  quality (where is  the patch, Michal?), on the other hand  BlÅmchen's left eye
  is painted very bad.  Her blue pullover should have  been painted in more blue
  color-steps. Some people criticised the wild structures  right and left of her
  head. (Hi Kay!;)

  Please not too much  ego-tripping in  the next demo. One  Mystic Bytes-logo in
  the  beginning or  somewhere  else in the demo is  enough. But three MB-logos,
  two of  them integrated in  effects, is a  bit overdone.  ÛTEARDROP-logos would
  have done the trick as well.

  There is  no design  at all in the end of the demo. It just  stops and returns
  to the desktop.

  All in  all a demo was some design but somehow you get  the feeling they had a
  real time-out this time, having no time to design it all.

  ÚRating: [6/10]



Okay, that's it for  this  issue. In  the end  I like to shout a loud "Hello" to
ÒAgent -t-, who should move his ass and do some pixel-stuff for ÛBinLiner.
