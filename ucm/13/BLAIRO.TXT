óAaarg!ð Another fake demo! This time it  comes from France and  isn't made by one
of the "normal" fake bands, but  by the chaps  of òTYPHOONð, or better  their most
active member so far, óTHE BEASTð, with the help of some Amiga people.
Hmm, another one  to fuck because of his  work? Don't know, let's  take a closer
look to the demo.

At  first the  limitation to STE  seems a bit  strange, but  hey, I have  such a
machine to test it, are you ready for some butt kicks?! =)

The  demo has to be started  from the desktop and  starts with the  best looking
screen of the whole demo. A òTYPHOONð logo appears on the screen, it isn't special
but does  the job, the  background  is violet  coloured, two light  violet boxes
scrolling in from the lower and upper border, the logo begins to move a bit in a
strange way and below the logo the 'presents' were shown in a wriggling style.
Besides this a funky chip sound is played, I think it was done by óJEDIð of òSECTOR
òONEð... The whole thing is looking like this...

After  this the name of the  demo is displayed with  a nice but  again wriggling
font on white background. No question, the whole thing has the job to  remind us
to the old ñO-DEMOð, not only the name, ñBLAIR-O-DEMOð (Blairo means lamer in french
... any questions?) also  the style of this  presentation  reminds a bit  to the
masterpiece of òOXYGENEð. But  can óTHE BEASTð hold  this style  throught  the whole
demo... Sorry... óNOð.

Right after this black backgrounds  take over the job and using a  nice font (by
some Amiga artist, I think) the "show" starts  with displaying some  pictures of
pure lamers, just  like òBILL GATESð  and a lot of  others I don't know... This is
the point, the  frenchies  are still  fighting against  the PC, trying  to laugh
about them as good as possible... even if they're failing from time to time...

After several scanned pictures the next part is announced, the first demo screen
by óBILL GATESð! 'What?' I  thought... erm... it's just  a fakedemo! But  hey, the
idea isn't bad... óTHE BEASTð just digged out the old ñDEMO CONSTRUCTION KITð, short
DCK from the early  nineties. And  as this  screen starts, displaying  three big
rasterbars, a one  plane scroller, a  starfield, a óBILL GATESð picture and an old
chip music is replayed it reminded me hard to  some old òGERMSð intros, especially
made by óTHE MASTERBOYð, maybe the biggest  lamer on ST so  far. It is as  ugly as
possible... horrr! óThe "old" times =)...
In the scroller standing things like ñ"Buy Windows"ð and such a shit... grrr... =)
Anyway a nice  idea because I thought the  DCK was catched  by the shadow of the
forgettening. It was surely a strange tool but some people matched it to release
real nice screens and demos  with it, just like an  old demo made  by óSPIRALð and
óOXBABð under their old label (before taking over the leadership under the òDIAMOND
òDESIGNð label) back in 1991. Sorry, I don't remember its name...

The next part, with a music by óBIG ALECð, fucked up because my file was corrupted
(and I got  it two  times from several  people)... hum.... because  it's  called
ñ'Entracte'ð I think  it could be a hit in the  direction  of the òEXAð  dentro from
1996? Don't know...

Another nice part is the greetings  sequence, there are some  pictures displayed
with the  names of the  people who are  greeted and believe me, some  are really
nice done, don't know if they're are just scanned. Anyway  some of them matching
to the guys mentioned, so óDMA SCð of òSECTOR ONEð is shown  as a small  guy blowing
into a trumpet and fart instead... or óBOUBð of òPOPSY TEAMð is  displayed  as Sumo-
wrestler... others are thought to laugh about the nicknames, just  like óMC LASER
of ò.tSCc.ð sitting on an electric chair...
ñNice idea, nice grafix, nice soundtrack (of an unknown artist).

Conclusion: Hmmm... òI don't like fake demos, you know?ð But there are  still some
            demos around with a bit of originality. Ok, even ñ"BLAIR-O DEMO"ð is a
            bit too boring in some parts, but the ñDCKð part is òfunnyð, not because
            of using it as óBILL GATESð' first demo, no, for me it's funny because
            it reminds me to some lamers on Atari. The rest (of the demo I could
            see) isn't very special. The  grafix doing  their job, there  aren't
            any shit looking ones included and I like esp. the little piccies at
            the greetings part. The used  musix are nice too, esp. the funky msx
            of  the intro  part. Therfore the  demo suffers  under the  ólack  of
            ódesignð, after  a promising start  it  isn't  the highlight  of  this
            production. All in  all it's  just a demo for  the people  who don't
            like PC's and are modest in points like design and effects...
