I.    Introduction
------------------

In times when  pop music reached  it's lowest level, we all  have to  search for
alternatives. The charts  suck like hell and all those lousy cover versions from
glorious 80's hits are sucking even more. 
In this  article I will  give you some view of what  is spinning  on my Technics
turntables right now. Music don't has to be new to be good! So be prepared for a
very abstract  musical assortment. This is about the evolution of the electronic
underground music in general. This is about Turntablism.

The story of  the evolution of  electronic music is an endless one. I could fill
hundreds of pages with this topic, but my time on earth is limited and so I have
to cut it down a bit...
In the  late 60's  and  early  70's mostly  german sound  technicians  made  new
experiments... to name a  few: CAN, TANGERINE DREAM, KLAUS SCHULZE and  last but
not least KRAFTWERK.
When 'Autobahn' came out in 1974 it was a big success, even in  the USA and that
leveled  the way for  the electronic music... More and  more artists and  groups
appeared and we can say that the 80's were the decade of Synthiepop.

Now, in  the end of  the 90's it is time  to return to  the source! Someone  who
wants to be a DJ these days has to be original...
For example: When a  coverversion of some famous track came out, I always wanted
to have  the original  track, coz' I  wanted to  teach the  people  that  it's a
fucking coverversion. It's my way to educate the masses. Most of the young tech-
kiddies are bloody lamers  and they know nothing... and the worst of them all is
that they aren't even interested!!
I think it's  important for every DJ or musician to  know something  about every
style of music. Open mindedness is very important... 

Here's a little quiz:

1. Name 2 of  the trax  the Freestylers sampled  in their  track 'Drop the boom/
   don't stop'!

2. Tim Simenon, who  produced  the last  Depeche Mode  album  has  also  another
   project. Please name it and tell me their first big hit they had in 1988!

3. Juan Atkins, famous  american techno-producer  has several  projects running,
   but what was his very first record he ever released back in 1983?

Ok, that's all for today. The solution will be given in the next issue.
So I'm really interested if anyone out there knows the answers...

enjoy.

II.   Turntablism
-----------------

I went down  to the next  city, which is Karlsruhe, to be  precise to  visit my
local record dealer and found some very interesting vinyl.

Fave tracks or Floorburners are marked with the Asterisk key (*):



 o  DYNAMIX II - from 1985 to present (4x12")                          [REPHLEX]

    This set of four 12" Singles is composed of lotsa old and rare Electro stuff
    from mainly the 80's. DYNAMIX II is one of the  leading crews  when it comes
    to Electro and Techno bass. The set includes following tracks:
    DJ's GO BERZERK, IGNITION, TECHNOLOGY, BASS GENERATOR (*), ATOMIC AGE,
    II EVOLVE THE FUTURE (*), JUST GIVE THE DJ A BREAK (REMIX), TECHNO BASS (*),
    1 MILLION MHZ, FEEL THE BASS, ENERGY (*) and DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL.
    This compilation really rocks the turntable!
    


 o  84 - Electro people                                                      [?]

    This one  is a really  old-schoolish-electro-pop-track and it  reminds me on
    'Super Sonic' by the  Music Instructor. The  label is just  black and  white
    with an 80's-styled  human figure build  out of boxes. Thanx to  the record-
    shop that they labeled the project name '84' to the cover.
    Well, the bassline sounds like the  one from 'Let the music play' by Shannon
    and I'm sure they used a 303! (Hey Sentry, when will it be finished!?!?).
    There  are 4 versions  of the  track on  the vinyl and  they sound  all very
    similar but anyway quite good.


 
 o  RESET - Egyptian lover                                                 [WEA]

    When I first  saw this  record I  thought 'Wow! A new track by  the Egyptian
    lover (a famous electro wizard)', but I was so wrong.
    The track is  called 'Egyptian lover' and the project is  called RESET. This
    track is some sort of freestyle! Contents:
    
    A1 - Egyptian lover (Dancehall style)
         Stupid 4 to the floor beat for stupid Viva-kids!

    A2 - Egyptian lover (Extended version)
         Brilliant freestyle mix!

    B1 - Egyptian lover (Electro mix) (*)
         Absolutely best version of all. Very cool strings! 

    B2 - Egyptian lover (Freestyle cut)
         Same as A2!

    B3 - Egyptian lover (Evening intro)
         Same as A1



 o  FATBOY SLIM - The Rockafeller Skank                                  [SKINT]

    A1 - The Rockafeller Skank (*)
 
    Right about now, the funk-soul-brotha 
    turn it out now, the funk-soul-brotha
    
    This sentence  is the one that  travels inside my  mind for the  most in the
    last time. This track is a  real BIGBEAT smasher, or should  I say BREAKBEAT
    coz' it's too fast to mix with other Bigbeat stuff.
    It sounds more like rockmusic than any other style but it really  kicks ass.
    Especially  the break in  the middle of  the record blows  your head  to the
    clouds!

    B1 - Always read the label

    Downbeat. Hip Hop  with guitars. A bit too slow to mix up with all the other
    tracks. But if you play the record on 45 minus 8% it really rocks!
    To the beat ya'll and I won't stop!

    B2 - Tweakers delight (*)

    This one is  just a tweekin' acid sequence comparable to Josh Wink's 'Higher
    State of consciousness'. It was also used in an older track from 1997 called
    'Everybody needs a 303'. A very good DJ tool!



 o  FATBOY SLIM - Punk to Funk                                           [SKINT]

    A1 - Punk to Funk (*)
    
    A bigbeat  smasher with streched 'Punk to Funk' voices and strange sounds at
    all. Later  on a cool  sample (sounds like  Jazz) is  coming  up and it gets
    really funky! This one is a bit older. I think from 1997... or 1996.

    A2 - Knuf ot knup

    The title  is very strange  but it's  the same like A1 but  written reverse.
    After  the first  break a very evil  bassline is doing  it's job and  nearly
    blows my speakers to hifi-heaven. Subsonic overload!

    B1 - Big Beat souffle

    Evil beats  tormenting my room. Oh man Fatboy Slim's really  crazy. Again an
    evil Distorted Acid-Sequence fills the air and lotsa filters are used.    



 o  KOMPUTER - Valentina                                                  [MUTE]

    Komputer is to  Kraftwerk what Oasis is to the Beatles and  that's how their
    music sound like. I was  very surprised  to find a  Komputer 12" at the WOM-
    Store in  Karlsruhe. The  song 'Valentina Tereshkova' was first  featured on
    their first EP released in 1996. This 12" features:
    
    A1 - Valentina (probe)
    
    I was  a little  bit dissapointed  after hearing  the first  beats  of  this
    version coz' it's 4 to  the floor and that  reminds me of  the new Kraftwerk
    Tracks that were played on their concert that I attended last year.
    Ok, the sounds  are really nice but the 4/4-beat destroys  everything of the
    original track.    
    
    A2 - Valentina (single) (*)

    This is  the original  track  featured also  on the  first E.P. That  one is
    really cool but  a bit shorter. The full version can also be  heard on their
    first album called 'The world of tomorrow'.

    B1 - Valentina (danos)

    Hmm, and again stupid 4/4! Does not sound very innovative.

    B2 - Space Walk (*)
       
    Very cool for the chill out evening. Silent. Like walking in space :-)
    Real Kraftwerkisch also. It reminds a bit on 'Spacelab' by Kraftwerk.



 o  SOUTHSIDE ROCKERS - Rock on                                           [EPIC]

    A1 - Rock on (Maxi)

    The Southside Rockers  are one of  the leading Breakdance crews  from europe
    and this  track's really cool. Some electro beats with raps and vocals and a
    some sort of Salsa-touch. Takes you back to the 80's...

    B1 - Rock on (Rock the show mix)
    B2 - Rock on (Rock the show dub mix)

    Stupid 4/4 shit comparable to Jason Nevins lame remix of RUN DMC!



 o  ANTHONY ROTHER - Sex with the machines                          [KANZLERAMT]

    A1 - Human made (*)

    "You got no work. because of me. I'm a machine. I never sleep."
    A downpitched machinevoice is speaking this very brilliant text! Atmospheric
    strings leading  you to this electro epic by Anthony Rother. This guy is one
    of  the  hottest  acts  in  the   1998  Electro-scene. He  recently  made  a
    coverversion  of  Kraftwerk's 'Trans-Europe-Express'  and  also  'Red  Light
    Destrict' is a really fave track from him.

    A2 - Sex with the machines

    I put my  input: Sex with  the machines. Should this be the future of sexual
    activities? If  robots can dance, then  to this beats. I have  never thought
    that I  will ever  buy a  record  from  KANZLERAMT, coz' their  minimalistic
    techno stuff  is total shit for me. That's the reason why I  declared techno
    as dead for myself.

    A3 - Basic level (*)

    A quite track with a harmonic sequence. Really good for chill out.

    B1 - Love is for the hardest people

    Fast and dark... coz love  is for the  hardest people. Minimalistic  grooves
    and downpitched voices again.

    B2 - Describe reality

    This track  is also featured  on the ELECTRO BOOGIE mix Vol. 2 mixed by Dave
    Clark. Check out the robot flavour when this machine describes it's reality.

    B3 - Past represents the future (*)

    "I was created  in the past. I'm  controling in the  present. Next  I'm make
    them  equal.... In  the  past  humans  created... In  the present  they  are
    controled... In the future they will be automatics..."    

    "Past represents the future" is good introduction for a DJ-set.
 


 o  BASS JUNKIE - In bass ... no one can hear you scream      [BREAKIN' RECORDS]

    A1 - In bass no one can hear you scream

    A very  long dialog  sampled from  the movie ALIEN is the beginning  of this
    track. Then  the beats with  subsonic basses hit the decks. Shortly followed
    by a weird Acid-line. A break introduces a new baseline followed by a melody
    similar to some Kraftwerk track.

    A2 - Beyond time beyond bass (*)

    Starting  off with  beats and a  subsonic bass  that could kill  your stereo
    speakers if you turn it up to loud. :-)
    Technoid basslines. Sweeping strings. Fast beats. Again acid. Neo-electro at
    it's best.
    
    B1 - Science

    Strange. The  beats  remind  me  a  bit  on  'Numbers' from  Kraftwerk. Some
    'Science'-Sample  comes up. I think I  also recognized  samples from 'Planet
    Rock' there.

    B2 - Robotechno (*)
 
    Really my fave  track on this EP. In the beginning you can hear the voice of
    HAL 9000, sampled from the movie '2001': "I'm completely operational and all
    my circuits are  functioning perfectly." The beats come up and  you can hear
    samples  from  Kraftwerk (as  usual). I  recognized 'Tour  de  France', 'The
    robots' and 'Music Nonstop'. This is how sampling should be done. 
    
    
    
 o  MANDROID - Electro freaks rehab clinic                    [BREAKIN' RECORDS]
 
    A1 - Electro freaks rehab clinic
    A2 - Analogue addict (*)
    A3 - Funky brother
    A4 - Computer controlled
    A5 - Jammin' on my old piano (remix 2)
    
    B1 - Android (*)
    B2 - Battle theme
    B3 - Subsonic tendencies
    B4 - Rogue missile

    This is the first ever released Album on Breakin' records, the label from Ed
    DMX from DMX KREW. I only  give here  some general  insight. The  tracks are
    really futuristic electro tunes with acid sounds and lotsa vocoder voices...
    Highly recommended!
 
 
 
 o  MISS KITTIN & THE HACKER - Champagne E.P.       [INTERNATIONAL D.J. GIGOLOS]
 
    A1 - Gigolo intro
    A2 - Frank Sinatra (*)
    A3 - The grey area
    B1 - 1982 (*)
    B2 - Gratin Dauphinois
    B3 - Gigolo outro
    B4 - Dirty Talk (*)
 
    Some guys  already declared  this record  to the  Techno-record of the year.
    Miss Kittin's  voice reminds a bit to Anne Clark, which is always a bonus in
    my eyes :-) The  marvellous '1982', which  is played  nonstop in  the clubs,
    sounds  like a  timewarp  back to the  80's. Great. Also  FRANK SINATRA is a
    great Track, aswell as the remake from DIRTY TALK from KLEIN & M.B.O.
    Different and Brilliant!
  
 
 
 o  HARZFEIN PROJEKT #4 - Dagobert                     [HARZFEIN STUDIOS DESSAU]

    A1 - Introduction
    A2 - for the shure shock rockers
    A3 - dark power (*)
    A4 - sliproad to feel
    A5 - chillbonus
    B1 - Bassinvasion (*)
    B2 - inharmonie whispers
    B3 - boomdrummer
    
    A fantasic  album is  coming from  the  HARZFEIN PROJECT  from east germany.
    Straight electro  100 prove! Best tracks  are  marked, as you can  see. DARK
    POWER featured a sample  coming  from Hashim, which  was one of  THE electro
    wizards 13 years  ago. The tracks are  featuring very nice  harmonies. Great
    melodies and brilliant strings.


    
 o  HARZFEIN PROJEKT #5 - The voyage of Reckless       [HARZFEIN STUDIOS DESSAU]

    ThisSide
    1 - Adventurez on marz
    2 - The voyage of recklez 
    3 - Supercomputer

    ThatSide
    1 - Time to freak out
    2 - The voyage of recklez (part 2)
    3 - Tuttz
    4 - Funky drummer 2001 (*)
 
    Another production  coming from the  HARZFEIN STUDIOS. Not much to say. Good
    for Hip Hop DJ's. The  FUNKY DRUMMER 2001 is using the original beat-samples
    from JAMES BROWN.



 o  KLYSTRON + JENNY - Platis                                        [RIOT CITY]
 
    A1 - Platis remix
    A2 - Loop 1
    A3 - Loop 2
    A4 - Platis stringsapella
    A5 - Loop 3
    B1 - Platis dub mix
    B2 - Loop 4
    B3 - Platis original
    B4 - Loop 5
    
    A very chilly electro tune with 'Anne Clark'-alike voices  again... I have a
    faible for that :-) The  loops on the  record are very well  done except the
    last one. Great tools for the turntable rockers! The rest is  more something
    to chill then to mix or dance.


Hm, it was more a big record review... Naah, who cares anyway. I have still some
more  new vinyl  like the  FREESTYLERS' album  WE ROCK HARD  or  the  new JUNGLE
BROTHERS 12" called JUNGLE BROTHER featuring an  very kickin  Drum'n'Bass mix by
Mickey  Finn. I'm  sorry  but my time  is running  out coz  then  next  issue is
aproaching... See you next time.

III.  Backsp!n
--------------

I always include older tracks into my DJ-Sets coz' I think that tracks don't get
worse when  they get  old. That's what the industry  wants us to  believe. It is
possible that you hear a track from 1984 after a track from 1998.
Why not? A track  that can be heard in every set from me is for example 'FUTURE'
by Model 500  which was  released in 1985. I play it  behind that  famous 'SPACE
INVADERS ARE SMOKING GRASS' by I-F from 1997 and people like it. A fusion of old
and new is the best way to rock the party... and the decks...
So here are some of my old favourites:

o MODEL 500 - FUTURE (METROPLEX)

o CYBOTRON - CLEAR (FANTASY)

o BOMB THE BASS - BEAT DIS (ROUGH TRADE)

o HUMANOID - STAKKER HUMANOID (WESTSIDE RECORDS)

o KRAFTWERK - NUMBERS

o ANNE CLARK - SLEEPER IN METROPOLIS

o THE SCIENTIST - THE BEE (KICKIN' RECORDS)

o KICKSQUAD - SOUNDCLASH (KICKIN' RECORDS)

o NITZER EBB - MURDEROUS (MUTE) 

o ULTRAVOX - LOVE'S GREAT ADVENTURE (CHRYSALIS)



So check it out!
