                 Crywolf - Reservoir Gods (128 byte intro) (Falcon)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After depacking the archive which was supposed to contain the intro, I wondered.
It is more than 3 kbytes ...
The  reason for  that is  the very  long readme-file which by  the way  has very
little to do with the intro or the Reservoir Gods or computers or whatever.
It is rather  a story about Morten Harket, ex-leadsinger of the  pop group A-ha,
which was well known during the 80s.
In comparison  to the 3kb ASCII-text, the demo seems just like an add-on someone
forgot to remove. ;-)

So, in the bottom  lines of the readme-file it is said to switch the Falcon into
Truecolour and execute the 160 bytes (128 bytes + file header).
I did so and here is the summary.

This demo  is called  Crywolf, and in the readme-file and on the  Reservoir Gods
page, they call  it to be a "Wolf-3D-engine" in 128 bytes. This of course sounds
very impressing ...
So far  the  smallest  Wolf-3D-engine  I have  seen was a 4ktro. It  displayed a
smooth trip through  a corridor  of green, textured wall-patterns, taking  a few
turns and moving constantly.
I already  considered this one very  impressing. The  texture may  have been not
very well drawn, but  I guess it was a question of saving  memory. It moved very
smoothly and I found it very impressing to pack that into 4k bytes.

(note by moondog... it was .tnb.'s "TÅtensuppenzauber" 4K, SiliConvention'97)

Probably you get an impression of what I expected as a "Wolf-3D-engine". I could
not believe that this was  supposed to be possible in 128 bytes, so  of course I
was very excited when I launched crywolf.

After crywolf is being started, it displays the following picture:
The  middle of  the screen  is black, the  top and  the bottom is blue, which is
being faded to black to the middle of the screen, so you get the impression of a
large  room with  the upper  half of the screen  depicting  a ceiling  that gets
darker in the  distance and the  lower half  of the screen displaying the floor,
which of course also "vanishes" in darkness.
To the left  and to the right of the screen you have trapezes which are supposed
to represent the  walls you move  along. In  these  trapezes, colours  are being
shifted from  the middle of the screen to the border, so you get  the impression
of actual movement.

And that's it, I guess there is very little more to expect in 128 bytes. However
... this demo leaves me with a big question mark over my head.
It's not  that this 128byte-tro is bad - it isn't. But  it's not as  good as the
readme and the name suggest: Crywolf - Wold-3D-engine in 128 bytes.
It is no Wolf-3D-engine. It is not even a "good" simulation of a Wolf-3D-engine.
I don't  blame the Reservoir Gods  for this, I rather guess  a Wolf-3D-engine or
even a good simulation of such is just impossible in 128-bytes, but this demo is
claimed to be  something which it is not, and that is  never a good thing to do,
neither in Megademos nor in 128-byte-intros.

For a 128-byte-tro, the design is very good. The typical "odd" behaviour of 128-
byte-intros like remaining TOS-cursor, odd  border colours or  things like that,
do not appear in these 128 bytes and this is definetly the strong part of it.
The effect  being displayed is okay for 128-bytes and  I guess, much  more of an
effect like this isn't possible in 128 bytes.

If they didn't call it a Wolf-3D-engine, I would have said nice, but this way, I
would just call it a nice try. ;-)

      issue of Maggie. ;-)
