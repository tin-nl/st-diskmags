
Hello! There are two different views of MAGGIE enclosed in this  article, one by
moondog (the first one) and one by The Paranoid (the second, or what, eh?).

Hi! Here comes the review of the latest MAGGIE, and it's a review, NO slaggview.

For the slow ones (and there  seem  to be at least one of them (a ópinkð coloured)
in the  UK): I write  my  review  about the  ST version. I can't test anything I
haven't seen  so far and  will  never do  it. And because  my Falcon burned away
about one year ago I'm  not able to test Falcon  warez. I really would do it but
I can't... perhaps other people would try to write  some stuff about things they
never saw but I need some stuff on my screen to write something about.

Hum. If you can see I'm not very happy with the crusade of MR óPINKð and I have to
fight against my intention to drill him down  to the ground. But I don't want to
kick the other people who  are working on  Maggie because it  seems to be óPINKð's
private  problem. The other writers  doing a good job, no  question, and so also
the latest UCM got good ratings (egotrip... hehe).

The ST version cames along without intro again (...) and fits  on a DD disk with
some little goodies (like sources by TAT/AVENA and other stuff).
After loading  the  mag the usual  good menu, coded  by TAT/AVENA appears on the
screen but again  with a horrible ugly  background  picture and I really want to
know  the sources  where  they  get  those cruel  pictures. Anyway this time the
colours are better chosen and I was able  to read the menu on my TV set again, a
small bonus point in  comparison with  the  last issue.

Therefore also this issue features no music on the  ST and this is a bit boring.
You  have just  this small bleep  at the  beginning and  while reading  the tons
articles from time to time.
I think  there are  several good chip  musicians left on the  ST who are able to
compose also exclusive  soundtracks  and it should be no problem to ask them for
a special sound... I think  we ST users  don't  deserve it to die in silence (or
is it just a  feature to force the people to buy a Falcon just to  enjoy the big
egotrippaz RG shell?!). But  the strangest point is that  the ResGods  have with
MSG a real  good chipper in their own team and they don't even use  a music made
by him...

Anyway. I switched on my  stereo system, putted in the new album of Joachim Witt
and started to read the BIG amount of  articles, except the  regulars stuff, the
feedback corner and adverts there are about 8o articles  included, some  of them
were so long  that they had to be splitted in  two or more parts. Hey  you might
say! Cool about 8o informative articles... NO! Harharhar...
Harharhar?! Yep... not  all entries are  really informative  because "MAGGIE 26"
features maybe the  biggest craptalk corner in his long history, with 15 entries
(remembers me to the old days of the UCM back in 1994/1995) filled up with about
13o kb pure senseless articles (ofcourse  not without kicking the UCM sometimes)
for all the  sooo fucking depressive  people around... Eh?! Are  them thought to
enlight my grim looking face?! Erm I hope not... because I don't need this stuff
for my enjoyment... just watching the Simpsons all the day is  fun enough for me
(I have about 15o episodes on video... is there anyone who want to compete?!).
Anyway some other  articles aren't interesting too, just like MR óPINKð's 9o KB of
destroying the UCM. LOT (.tnb.) thinks  it's a good thing  for the UCM itself if
someone writes  so many lines about it. I think who the hell  is interested what
MR óPINKð is thinking about every little article or even  entry in the UCM's news-
part?! Maybe he needed this long article to write  down his frustration. I don't
know but be sure... I have pity with him! Hell! It's my job!
Not very interesting, eh! For me not  even credible are  the MAGGIE CHARTS which
fill up other 1oo KB of space... And ofcourse (?!)... MAGGIE is the  best mag in
this charts. So why the UCM don't has  the right to  stay on the  first place in
the UCM charts?! Another  question no one  can ever answer... not even the mega-
kewlness-rocking-new-invented-maggie-main-editor...

But hey, there are a lot of interesting articles to read too! Ok, about  all the
reviews I don't want to say much, the reviews  are very Falcon related and there
are only a  very few ST reviews included too. Because  I saw the most stuff even
before MAGGIE was released and the  most stuff was reviewed in the UCM 12 before
(maybe with  bad reviews... this  stands for  us, eh?! Anyway we're  not MR óPINK
SUNGLASSES and if  we don't  like something we  don't have  problems to write it
down instead of talking around it as good as possible, just to  avoid it to kick
some otherone in the scene...).

But there are a few interesting reviews included too, of stuff we don't got hold
so far and  for this we  must congratulate them again. Just like  the preview of
the long-a-waited game "K" from EXA / France. I tried it again and  again to get
a preview but  failed again and again too... So it's nice to read that there was
finally a  preview of the game  released after I saw  adverts for the  game in a
french magazine and red something about it there.

Another reviewed and interesting title was "PUSHAGO" by the german Omikron Basic
Man MARKUS BINDER... After he was going  mad because I drilled  some of his ugly
old games in  the floor I never  heard anything from him  except that he stopped
his biggest project because of memory capacity limits. But it seems as my critic
has forced him to go on (at least it's  my point of view) and so there are still
some projects by him in the pipeline.

A bit disappointed I was about the  review of the so  called "VROOM o3o"... it's
also known as "VROOM MULTIPLAYER" and was  spread around straight  since 1993...
If you expected  another game which  finally was  recovered and  released you're
just wrong. I got hold of this game back in 1995, right after I got my Falcon...
So it's all other than new or new spreaded around. But take this article as some
golden oldie-test.

This issue also features a lot of other interesting things, like the usual disk-
mag-reviews  featuring the  latest releases  on the mag scene, at least  UCM and
some british releases.
A music corner  is included  too and in comparison with  UCM there you  can read
several  reviews about techno/dance/triphop  oriented acts... but this  isn't my
style and so I have  to ask MR óPINKð: Why I should  review MOUSE ON MARS and  the
other bands you  mentioned when I don't like  their music and so I don't want to
buy their  records  and so I don't  get hold of them?! Just to give  you another
point to  critize?! No  way, dude... But  hey... just  for  you I have  reviewed
several  international  acts  in  this  issue  too! I  don't  listen  to "german
industrial acts" only but I think MC LASER told you this already in the IRC...

There are also  some interesting  interviews included, just as with KEV CALLAHAN
who coded "BOMBAMAN" or DRACO, coder of the Atari 8oo emulation.
Ok, short  snippets  about other  interesting stuff  to read... just  like their
scene news (congratulations... even if it looks as you only mentioned things you
like to see there...), a fucking big ALTERNATIVE PARTY report (but with the time
you're  going tired, reading  about stuff  which happened before  the party...),
things about the Internet, an  article similar  to our view  about announced but
never released demos... but they wrote about games, a lot of games!

A very strange article, not  because of the idea, because  of MR óPINKðs views, is
an article about  the background and sense of the name  of scene bands and scene
productions  too. Unfortunately he hasn't an  idea what "hmmm" means... maybe he
watched too much porn movies in his childhood but it's not the thing you thought
MR óPINKð... maybe it's another sign that he loves our adult corner too, eh?
About his  wrongest idea about the  POETS OF DECAY I laughed  like mad! This guy
has a really  strange  imagination! But it  shows that  there is someone writing
about a topic he hasn't any  notion of... I can only  say: Just kill'em! He's so
suffering under his strange mind, we have to help him with a gun!
Btw... mOd is NO member of the POETS OF DECAY! Where the hell got you this info?
I have to stop here... because no one will be interested  in it... erm... anyway
this article lives from the  simple minded view of  a guy who  had a band called
THE LEMMINGS and is now laughing about other names and labels... and ofcourse he
likes his old DENIM label too...

Ok, back to the more informative articles. For coders TAT opens  again his chest
and talks about DSP stuffs and splines. Also MR óPINKð is writing down some coding
hints, about  Midi programing. And  what? TOODELOO, the swedish  master himself,
gives (just like  mOd in  the grafix area) some hints for  tracking! Nice, maybe
some inactive  people will dig out  the Protracker or something  else and try to
track their own modules now.

CiH writes down his own view on the last 5 Falcon years (more positive as my own
view... any questions? It's IRONIC! Harharhar...) and a  several other  articles
appearing too.

Ok... I think  it have to  stop here. All in one, it's again  a typical issue of
MAGGIE, but the change of the main editor  can be a  failure with the time. PINK
uses his position just to kick  the UCM any time and this  isn't only disgusting
but also a bit boring  with the time. But ok, you wanted the competition and you
will get the competition. Untill now it was just fake... now the times are going
harder! We're just -KAMPFBEREIT-...

But hey, I'm writing again  about my private feelings about MR óPINKð... not about
MAGGIE itself! Shit! But let me come to an end...
"MAGGIE # 26" contains  a lot  of articles  worth  reading, but again, as always
some articles without sense, and I don't mean the craptalk part only!
Therefore it's massive filled with  articles, not just a few, you  have hours to
read, even for the interesting ones.
But the ST version suffers under  the careless putting  together of it, no music
to entertain the ears of the reader too, an ugly main menu background (but eh, I
can't remember a nice picture since MAGGIE was taken over by the british writers
again...) and only a very few pictures are included. You don't have many screen-
shots of games or  demos and so  it's hard to  imagine what the  writers meaning
with their strange english explanations sometimes... btw... this is a bad point,
there is  too much english babbling stuff no  real english man will  ever really
understand.

Conclusion: Surely a nice mag, if  there weren't the slaggs by  MR óPINKð. Without
            them (and maybe  some guys  like them  too, just  like NO of ESCAPE,
            esp. because his message  on the DHS guestbook was taken three times
            in here...) it  would be a  lot better, but  so I don't  want to let
            this negative point out in the contents and so it suffers under this
            point too. It features besides this boring and more private stuff (I
            think so...) also some very  interesting stuff  and could be  one of
            the best "undead" issues  since they have  taken over it  again from
            the DELTA FORCE. But it  suffers under  the unkind  putting together
            too... this is the reason for the low rating  of the  shell/menu, as
            long as they don't include a music (an original one would  better up
            the situation much more).
            Anyway, decide  by yourself, because I can't  review it  without mad
            thoughts...

                            - MAGGIE 26 REVIEW -

Well, since Undercover Magascene got the beating of its  lifetime in the  Maggie
issue 26, we thought  it would only be fair to give a "short" review of Maggie's
last issue here.
No, we're not going to look extremely close at every single article like Mr.Pink
did it with UCM 12  and we're not  going to review the  editors  either. This is
something  which no one  of us would dare to do and we're  also a little shocked
that the Maggie-Team, well, mainly Mr.Pink, lowered themselves to such a level.
We did  expect some reaction from the Maggie-Team, especially  from Mr.Pink, but
we wouldn't have guessed that they would make THIS kind of racket about it.

So, what's in Maggie issue 26?
Since i could not run the Falcon version of Maggie because of a faulty download,
I started the ST version.
No  intro, no  music, no  title  screen, no  sequence.  The  background  picture
displays  someone from  the  Spice Girls  in a very  simple way, using  about 10
colours, no  dithering or  anti-aliasing in  any way. I guess  this picture  was
intended to be this simple but this knowledge doesn't make it look good.
Additionally technical, this graphic is very poor.

The  different "topics" can  be  found  in  "3D"-boxes  named  Editorial, Demos,
Various, Utilities, Adjust, Games, Humour, Multimedia, World  View, Picture  and
Quit. The Boxes cast shadows on the picture in a VERY simple way.
So far, the ST shell  looks extremely poor and  outdated. At this  point the ST-
user  gets  the  impression  that Maggie  does  not  emphasis  on a  comfortable
multimedia shell for ST users. Falcon users benefit from an intro (even by Tat),
music  and  animation/movement/nice background picture, but the  ST users  get a
bog-standard menu  probably coded in Omikron Basic - There  goes  the  technical
superiority of Maggie.

Like you  may have  guessed, clicking on one of the buttons makes  a menu scroll
up, enabling the reader to click on a special article.
After a nice "Loading" logo, which then fades to black, the reader is confronted
with the  ST-reading shell. This runs in Midres and looks, well, it  looks quite
boring to be honest.
Although  being quite  comfortable, displaying the number of pages  and bytes in
the upper left  corner, a "Show  pic" button (in  special  articles) and a "save
text" button  to export articles  as well as clickable up/down arrows  and a bar
displaying the actual position of the text like in a Gem-Window.
You can also click a "Quit" button which  transports you  back to the  main menu
and a "colors" button to browse through some different colour themes.
Well, the  font is  simple  and  the shell  looks  VERY dry  and  uncomfortable,
although it  isn't. No music, no  colourful graphics, again  the average  ST/STE
user finds the capabilities of his machine unused.

Now to give a short view into some remarkable articles.
The "News" section is called rumours & lies, which is an excellent title.
The  style of  this section  is very  nice and  each  paragraph has a  very nice
headline, a bit  underlining the  news to come and  also very entertaining. This
definetly is one of  the strong points of Maggie, although the constant slagging
against a "rival" magazine leaves  a sour taste. What does it matter in the news
section if UCM was right or wrong there?

The "Reviews" section features demo-reviews, mainly by CiH and Mr.Pink.
This is  another excellent  part of the magazine, because  the  descriptions are
rather too  long than too short. However, they are not 100% accurate  either, so
again I do not understand why they are slagging UCM for being so.
I personally  wouldn't mind that some effects seem to be missed out, but as long
as Maggie tries to blame UCM for that, they should avoid it themselves. However,
most reviews  are excellently written and the rating seems to be  reasonable, so
that their writing and rating goes along very well.

Under "Various" you'll first find the (in)famous Maggie charts, divided in 2 and
all in  all 115 pages  long. Okay, charts are always  nice to  read, but  charts
about "best Nintari game" make me raise an eyebrow. Okay, the Reservoir Gods are
being a vital  part of Maggie  and they're doing  an excellent  job, but is this
really more than just a big advertisment?
I mean, after  all, UCM  could introduce  a "best Spectrum game" or "Best TRS-80
game" charts next  issue as there  are excellent  emulators  for these  machines
available  for Atari computers - and i would like to  see Maggie's  reaction for
THIS kind of charts.
Besides in some cases Mr.Pink's self-written chart-evaluator fails, so that some
products  get mentioned  several times  at different places  in the  charts. For
example, Demolition  from DHS is 16th with 4 votes while Dem-o-lition is on rank
26 with 1 vote, giving  it 5 votes in total which moves its rank  from 26 to 15,
overtaking Eko's Are you experienced-demo with 1 vote. Again, if the Maggie Team
slaggs UCM for  being careless, they  should have verified the charts  for those
details.

Another highlight of Maggie is Tat's tutorial, this time about splines.
It's nice to read and also very instructive and for someone who is just starting
to code in  Assembler like me, it's also very  useful.  It's a bit  funny to see
though that Tat has  to use  ASCII-diagrams  to support his  tutorial instead of
graphics. Again, where  is the  technical superiority  everybody at Maggie is so
wild about? (Yes, there IS a picture, but it is just one, it is in lowres and is
not placed IN the text where it belongs...)

Hitting the "adjust" button  however made me laugh. A menu enabling me to select
between 50 and 60 Hz popped up, but nothing else. I hoped for a  music selector,
a font selector or a way to get rid of the boring main-menu  background picture,
but I didn't  expect a simple 50/60 Hz  switch. Although it is nicer  to read in
60 Hz, a bit more originality would work wonders here ...

In the "games" department you'll find, among excellent  reviews of other games -
really very good reviews - a bit self-advertisement again - The GodleNES games.
61 pages being used for describing  what each game is about, about  its pros and
cons. Really, I know that lots of effort went  into each game to  make it run at
suitable speed and with maximum comfort, but do they have to review the emulated
Space-Invaders like a real new Falcon game? I personally guess not.
This makes this special article VERY long and also very exhausting to read.

In the "Humour" department you'll find -among other quite amusing- things a "UCM
job offer". Now  this really  is a good one  and I had  to smile about  it. Much
better  are  even  the "Alternative charts" where  interesting topics  are being
evaluated. A pretty good department, I had quite some laughs.

Multimedia  features music  and book  reviews, something I could  do without. My
taste of music is not featured in any  diskmag so I don't see  why other peoples
taste should be covered here.
However, here comes the worst piece of Maggie  and something  they really should
not have done: An UCM special.
Over almost 100 pages, Mr.Pink  gives UCM the slagging of its  lifetime, digging
out every  detail and keenly looking at every  possible mistake the  UCM-editors
could  have done. I must  admit, in  some way, he is  correct and I  support his
opinion, in other aspects I must honestly say that I wouldn't have expected this
kind of journalism from Mr.Pink.
He digs  out every single  headline from UCM 12 and gives  his personal  opinion
about it. Is this really necessary? Does the  Maggie Team really  need this kind
of  beating up  a "rival" diskmag? Is this  the kind  of high-level  publication
Maggie  claims to be? Is this the kind of article Maggie readers want to have? I
guess not and  since this article is one of the major articles in Maggie, I have
the  impression  that  at least  Mr.Pink laid  great value  in giving  a kind of
special "feedback" to UCM 12. What is this supposed to be good for? I personally
am not  interested in  the quarrels  between  Maggie  and  UCM before their last
issues were released and I am just an average reader. Why spend almost 100kb for
commenting  every article  in UCM? Maggie readers who  already read  the UCM may
have very  well made  their own opinions  about it, Maggie  readers who  are not
interested in UCM won't read this section anyway.
I guess  it is mainly  the Maggie Team which is on warfare  against UCM, neither
the UCM nor the Maggie readers.
I'll  come  back  to this  article in  my  summary, but let's  finish the  short
overview first.

The  topic "World View" features  an  interesting  audience  with  Kev Callahan,
creator of "Bombaman" and Draco and in contrast to most other articles, they are
both rather short with only 15-17 pages.
The rest is background information and is very well presented.

The  button "pictures" removes  the menu  with a nice HBL effect, but  since the
buttons  do not cover any "vital" parts of the  picture, it doesn't  improve its
appearance much.

"Quit" finishes  your tour into Maggie while the "Maggie 26" button gives a kind
of info box and help dialogue.

Well, this article has already gotten longer than I intended, but I will come to
the summary right now.
First the most  important  part: The shell. In case you have  no Falcon  to read
Maggie, you're the  loser. The ST shell  of Maggie  is rather ugly. There  is no
other  word for it, and  although it is bug-free, I still  see LOTS of  room for
improvement. There  is no music - and I was even very dissappointed  to find out
that  UCM doesn't play  MC Lasers excellent Mod on the  STE. Having to  find out
that all sound Maggie has to offer on the ST(E) is a short sound taken from Tony
Greenwoods Diamond Ice is very sad, UCM plays great chiptunes from Tao!

Back to  the shell: It may be comfortable and it is nice to see it run in Midres
for better character display, but the font is boring and the graphical interface
is VERY simple. Mr.Pink is criticising  Moondog (UCM) heavily for not  using the
colour or graphical abilities UCM now offers ...
Well, the ST shell of Maggie features neither. The only possibility to display a
16-colour lowres picture is not even in the text and only a very small amount of
articles  even  use  that  feature. Text  is  monochrome  all  the time  and the
different coloursets to  browse through may alter the surrounding  graphics, but
that does not eliminate its very simple outlook.

To the  articles: Due to the fact that a lot more people are  involved in Maggie
it is obvious to see  their journalistic superiority. Reviews are quite long and
seem to feature  every aspect of the reviewed  product and their  rating is very
well explained in the text.
However, I miss "second thoughts". They slagg moondog for not liking Reanimation
because of  the colours, but on the other hand, Maggie features only one opinion
about  Reanimation, too. Why is this review  better? Just because CiH  likes the
colour scheme of Reanimation while moondog doesn't?
The reviews about GodleNES is a bit too  long and therefore  exhausting to read,
the charts feature some mistakes and I personally am growing tired of filling in
another voteform - no matter for what magazine I am supposed to fill it in.
But the greatest step into the mudhole is Mr.Pinks rant about the UCM.
These are  blows in the lower abdomen of the  UCM-editors and they  definetly do
not deserve  THIS kind of treatment. UCM may have its pros and cons, but so does
Maggie and  to take  every  single  line, opinion, review and  editor of UCM and
"review" it - or rather, make it look bad - is not a thing I would have dared to
do with Maggie.

And this  is exactly  why I wrote this  article. If the  Maggie-Team, especially
Mr.Pink, is  so fond about  the superiority of  Maggie, he should  have a closer
look at his precious magazine. There is no doubt  that Maggie is  good and in my
eyes, Maggie is at least one class above UCM, but even Maggie is not perfect and
I thought someone should say this.
Mr.Pink  said in  his rant  about UCM  that not  every  good  coder, musician or
graphician makes a good  writer. He may have  been right far more  than he would
like to be. After all, he is an excellent coder ...
