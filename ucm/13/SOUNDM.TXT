"SOUNDMACHINE" is another chip music player, written by The Beast of Typhoon. He
is working  on this little  utility since years now (if I'm  right). In times as
some people  are working on SID players to replay songs  of the C64 and so on it
is a bit  surprising that  there is still  someone who's working on a player for
all the Atari ST chip sound formats.

Many people tried it so  far but if  I remember no one matched it  to create the
"final" player at all. There were a lot of good tries  done, just like  the good
old "RISK PLAYER", the ".tnb. CHIP SOUND PLAYER" or the "FANTASY PLAYER". All of
them recognized  many different music formats and packing routines too. Esp. the
first two players could be something like the grandpa of "SOUNDMACHINE", because
they were GEM players too...

But those players  never reached a  higher state, they suffered under the not so
good  state of  the bands, just like  RISK as not  active anymore  or .tnb. as a
bunch of  pure chaotics. And the work on both players stopped in 1993/1994. They
even were not debugged with a big effort  and suffered under the many  bugs too,
locking up the system again and again.

Now with "SOUNDMACHINE" the try to make an ultimate player for ST and Falcon was
brought back to life  and so  it's not  false to give  the second  line "The New
Generation Of Players" in the info box of the started utility.

This new tool, made by the hyperactive ST fanatics from France, TYPHOON, isn't a
pure player but read more about it very below. Meanwhile the  local ST scenes in
many countries are only present with some small intros or  demos the guys in our
neighbour  country still releasing a lot  of other stuff  too, BESIDES the demo-
stuff. In comparison with other bands  all over Europe  the french  bands have a
lot  more  active members, mainly  working on  projects alone for  themselve, at
least  the  coders... Not  only TYPHOON is working  on such  tools and utilities
stuff, just remember the guys of SECTOR ONE too... their  productions also reach
some kind of semi-professional quality.
Maybe the reason for this is founded on the fact that  the french freax are much
more  involved in  the so-called  professional  scene too, just think  about the
CenTek  projects (Adrenaline & EXA)... Anyway, they're still good for the one or
other surprise... just like with "SOUNDMACHINE".

At first this tool is a chip-music player (can replay about 40 different formats
on ST!!!), at second  it is able  to  recognize a lot  of music  files (about 70
different formats) and at third it is able to found out new formats too and save
them in an own format. For this you have the possibility to check the headers of
the files you want to replay or recognize.
But at first to the recognize/replay function.

"SOUNDMACHINE" recognizes, as said above, MUCH more musics as all players so far
and can replay also a lot of them... Here comes a list...

Module formats and digitized sounds

Amiga Module, DBE Tracker, Digital Tracker, DMA module, Graoumf Tracker, Quartet
Sounds, Scream Tracker and TCB Tracker

A lot of samples can be recognized too, but I don't want to list them here.
Unfortunately (more or less) samples and tracker musics can't be played with the
"SOUNDMACHINE" but as written in the doc-file  there are  enough and  maybe much
better players around for these files.

Therefor "SOUNDMACHINE" offers a very usefull NEW function. You can  also try to
replay unknown  chip sound formats! Even if the program can  recognize more than
70 different formats  there are still musics around no one has a real idea of it
how to replay  them. So you can  try it  with "SOUNDMACHINE" but you  have to be
very carefully  because the system can crash  very hard if  you don't  chose the
right options/offsets. And unfortunately the program  will crash  also on Falcon
very often, even  if you're  using "BACKWARDS" or so on... but  it runs  on this
machine.

But back to the  unknown music formats. If you have found out  the right offsets
for replay them in the right way you can save them in a build in format, the own
"SOUNDMACHINE" format. So you can replay them at least with this  tool and maybe
there are sources around who allow it to use them with this format.
Ofcourse you can save any other music in  the "SOUNDMACHINE" format too and last
but not least  you can extract  them again, this means that the  program adds at
first some  bytes to  the music file  to recognize it as own  format  and if you
extract  it, to use it with another player or so on, you have the  original file
again...

Ok... furthermore there  is also a file included with the description of the new
"SOUNDMACHINE" format, besides long and detailed doc files in french and english
too.

As said above  the tool runs under GEM but with the limitation  that only on RGB
with 50 Hz the replay  speed is original and this isn't so good. Ok, no one seem
to use  monochrome only today but it sucks a bit to  change the monitors all the
time and for a GEM program it would be cool if it  would run in  ALL resolutions
WITHOUT problems. It's the same problem with the new player of the programmer,
the YM-player... just check out my review of this very new player at:
>--> YM PLAYER vo.3 <--<                                                            {*\YMPLAY.TXT}

For a beginner this tool is maybe a bit overloaded on the  first look, because a
lot of buttons and offsets  are displayed on the mainscreen. Maybe  a separation
of  the  replay-function  and of  the recognize-function, extract/save  function
would  be nice, because  a little change without any  idea of  it and  the whole
thing is locking up your machine. The mainmenu looks like this...

{*i sm2.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

But with a little bit of time you will surely find a way to use the functions in
the way it used to be.

Conclusion: In comparison with the older version I saw months ago the player has
            made big steps! Without any doubt it  is the best  developped player
            at all at the moment, at least on the  chipsound area. For this fact
            we can just forget the little bugs, esp. because also the old replay
            utilities never  were bugfree at all and crashed a lot more often as
            "SOUNDMACHINE". I would prefer  the option  to use it as background-
            player too and it isn't  sooo difficult  as The Beast is  writing in
            the docs, because the RISK player was running in the background. Ok,
            it is the problem with  the crashs there  and for this it could be a
            bit problematic but  at least the  possibility to  use a few "not so
            critical" formats as background music on the ST would be cool!
            Anyway... if you're still working on the ST and want  to enjoy a lot
            of old and new musics or you have  files on ripped  you can't replay
            with anything on your disk or  harddisk, just get "SOUNDMACHINE" and
            try it again... maybe it will manage it?!
