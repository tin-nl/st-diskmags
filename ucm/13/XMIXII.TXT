The second  part in  the XMIX module  compilation  series. This one  is slightly
bigger and takes  up ò2.8MBð on  your harddisk. It uses the  same  shell  as its
predecessor. So if you want any info on that, please check out the  review of:
>--> XMIX part I <--<                                                             {*\XMIXI.TXT}

So, let's  get right  to it. The tunes are much  more varied  than on  the first
XMIX. And that's  a good thing. Furthermore  you can expect the  same quality as
XMIX I, which is bloody excellent by the way.

ñTrack 1:

This  one  starts  with  atmospheric  background sounds  building up  and a deep
"Barry White-eqsue" óvoiceð thrown  in :) The bass  and the  strings  flow  nicely
along with  the background  noises and the  voice. Beautiful... But  oh.. Then I
start to  hear a ñclubbeatð again (aaarrgggg!), but  it isn't as bad as the one in
XMIXI (phew!).
After this  the song becomes  more structured and a  few melodylines are used to
good effect. This track  is truly great! One of  the best  atmospheric modules I
have heard. Not  an outstanding melody or anything  truly original, but  it just
does everything right! 9 OUT OF 10!

òTrack 2:

Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.. Yes, like  the ones  in your  Coke or Pepsi (or beer
for real men!). Very slowly it builds up into ñderranged beat patternsð.
Quite original, but  hardly good compared to  some of the same-style tracks I've
heard on CD. The song just isn't varied or complex enough.
I'll give this 3 out of 10 just for the smoothness and the originality.

óTrack 3:

Wow! Hold  on! Fast synthsounds. ñ303 noisesð. Really  phat beats. And very modern
instruments  thrown in as  well. It breaks down one  time. After that some well-
sounding strings are put in!
Aw yeh! Another great fast dance track. This is about as good as techno gets!
9 OUT OF 10!

ñTrack 4:

Very similar to  track 2. This time a bit calmer (Those  bubbles in track 2 made
me bonkers!). Again ñoffbeatð stuff  is used. But  hey, it  just ain't good enough
to stand on it's own. 3 out of 10 and for the same reasons as with track 2.

òTrack 5:

Oooohh.. ñSpeach samplesð and òhardtrance  soundsð. Once  again  we're  treated with
303 sounds. Strings are used very well indeed. It sounds delicious!
Only a pity it's a bit too short. 8 out of 10.

óTrack 6:

What a contrast  compared to the  last track. This  is a chilled out affair. The
bass is deep, the  strings give a ó"cyberish"ð atmosphere. And  then it turns into
a drum and bass  track! Wow! This is a track with  an edge! Then  it breaks down
to ñ80's type of beatsð totally unexpected. Id say 8 out of 10.

ñTrack 7:

Hold on.. If I'm  not mistaking  I hear ñelectro beatsð. I really  dig those! Some
more relaxed strings, 303 stuff (again, but  I just can't get enough!). And ooh.
Then comes some òflanging breakbeatsð to finish  it off! Top stuff! 8 out of 10!

òTrack 8:

This is the last one and the ñhardestð at that. Intense  hardhitting binary techno
beats. More 303! Good intense stuff, but a bit too short.
7 out of 10.

Overall, the sound is GREAT. By far the ñbestð music  compilation I've ever ñheard!ð
Fucking good stuff! òToodelooð proves  he can do  very  different  styles of music
and  can  do them  all in  the same  polished  style. All  of  the tracks  sound
professional. Even more so then in the first edition in this series.

The variation  in the tracks  is a good thing. Even  the worse  tracks add up to
the  whole  thing. Put  this  compilation  on  shuffle-play  and  year  ears are
treated  to an hour  of intense listening-pleasure. It's much  better  even then
XMIX-I. The shell  still isn't  ok, but with  these sounds.. Who  the hell cares
anyway!
