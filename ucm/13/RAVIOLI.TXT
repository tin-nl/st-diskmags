Today another  òfrench  compactð  popped into my mailbox and I was very surprised,
because it wasn't announced so far, at least of my knowledge.
It's  again  a release  by  the  hyperactive  french ST  fanatics of òTYPHOONð and
òSUPREMACYð but unfortunately again all other than a mindmelting production.

At first, it's a module disk... at second, it's a óbadð module disk... gorsch! And
what a bad disk! Ok, the sense of module compact  disx isn't very deep and there
were a lot of those disx made in the last years. As I remember  right they're as
old as the  ST compact scene itself. Ok, some of them matched it to  impress the
user with a nice  designed intro and very exclusive modules. Others have damaged
the whole thing with their fucking lame releases, like the òGERMSð in earlier days
(the intros by  óMASTERBOYð were some of the most horrible  screens I've ever seen
on ST so far!) or all those lame british shit bands who appeared around 1995.
The better releases of this genre were made by ò.tSCc.ð with many nice and stylish
intros and mainly original modules, composed by óMC LASERð or óSCYð.
Because all the  lame module disk makers vanished with the  time and only .tSCc.
were left  here I thought we would be saved now  and must not  suffer under such
embarrassing releases anymore... but how wrong I was!

Suddenly the new  ñZIK DISKð by òTYPHOONð damaged my dreams of a clean compact scene
without this strange releases.
I got my first cry after I saw the  intro of this 2disx-package! It was a ripped
and horrible old òAUTOMATIONð intro! What the  hell?! Only grafix  and scroll were
changed... ñaaaaaarghð! óTHE BEASTð! Even  one of  your simple  GFA intros  would be
better than  ripp off other  stuff! It's as lame  as the british  compact makers
posse I mentioned above! I'm very disturbed about this, sorry.

At next I started to check up the modules... only 4 modules  on the disk! And as
you can  think, it's techno stuff... just  as the  title ñ"RAVIOLI"ð says. I don't
like the most techno stuffs anymore, esp. all the actual shit...
Anyway I started the included player and... arg! It's a "patched" version of the
former very good ñPROTRACKER REPLAYð by óGRIFFð of the òELECTRONIC IMAGESð. Ok, at the
one hand  this player should run now on  Falcon too, on the other  hand, after a
short time my machine was bombed away!
So I started the great ñOSZI PLAYERð by ò.tSCc.ð and started to replay the modules.

95raver'.mod
Huuuuuuuuuh! This module was  composed by  óDAXð of òTHE RAVEBUSTERSð in 1995 and it
features all the ñhorrible hardtrance/trancecore shitð from this time! Holy shit!
You can listen to these filth eating DUNE idiots (hardcore vibes...bleurgh), the
PERPLEXER epileptic, MEMBERS OF MAYDAY grunts  and other  freax who  brought the
shame to the techno scene... Gaaaargllll...

misguide.mod
This one was composed by óCAPTAIN BIFATð of òTHE ELECTRONIC KNIGHTSð  in 1997 and is
a bit better, features  a lot of breakbeats, fast stomping  passages, some  nice
synth stuff but all in one  it's not  very good digestible  because of many very
strange noises and stuff. The whole thing isn't very long...

real.mod
This  song  is  called ñ"TRANCE SYSTEM"ð and composed by  óDAVEð of òFREEZERS^P3o3ð in
1996. I don't like trance anymore but I like some passages  with the  slow beats
on this module, but there are too many breaks and sometimes it has nothing to do
anymore with trance. Hum... other  passages sounding very cheap and not worth to
listen to them even one second. Don't know.

tchernob.mod
This track is called ñ"TCHERNOBYL'S FLOWERS"ð and is  composed by  óREZð of òECLIPSEð,
also a module  from 1995. But it's the  strangest on this  compile. At first you
can listen to some cruel sounds with birds singing and after  a hard (and for me
it was clear  that there will come a break after such  friendly sounds) break it
goes on with hard beats. Unfortunately the module jumps sometimes.
Anyway, with his hard and  fast passages, sometimes they're  more remembering to
some ñebm/industrial stuffsð, its my favourite module on this compile!

òConclusionð: Erm... as I  wrote it above, I don't like this kind of compacts very
            much and I don't like the style of music, but this is another story.
            Anyway, it's not so funny to ripp an intro, because  I know that the
            band has  enough coders  to create  such stuff alone  and so I don't
            understand  this move. It  remembers me to some  lame coders (or so)
            from the island who only ripp other codes off to put  some intros on
            their lame  compacts. And again... because it seems  that all  those
            bands  disappeared I was a  bit disturbed  to see now others, making
            the same failure...
            Ok, nothing more  to say that  even collectors should think twice if
            those disx are worth to be stored, it's just wasted capacity.
