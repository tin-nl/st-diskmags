--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not much to say about, just as I have reduced all parts to just 5  entries becoz
the most following entries  were too close to another (somtimes 5 or 6 different
entries with the same points) and this would be a bit senseless and only blow up
the list unneccessary.

Ok... that's all. I will not write anything to the  results in general, not even
how many different productions or guys of whatever entered the  single charts at
all because it's a horrible lot of work to count all the stuff together.
But hey... one result is surprises  you for sure... UCM doesn't ranked  first in
the DISKMAG charts this time! What happened?!
Maybe UCM 12 was really a bit more worse than we thought, maybe  for UCM #12 not
the amount of people has  voted as this time, maybe the british voters (and this
seems to be the reason) have voted only for their local hero...
We don't know. Anyway. We  accept it, esp. because they show up that  the result
of the last Maggie charts wasn't very credible because the distance between both
magazines is so  fucking small that they could just as  well stand on  the first
place together... But hey? No way dudes! The reason that we lost the first place
again is much more motivation  for us to go on, even a bit harder, because so we
have a goal to reach...
Anyway  check out  our new  charts idea, called "BEST OF 1998"... a more  actual
charts system as those alltimes charts, giving also newcomers the possibility to
step out of the shadows of some long dead gods and idols...
