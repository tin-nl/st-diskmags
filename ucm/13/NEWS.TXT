- ñPEGASEð is busy  with working  on a  game for the Falcon together with a single
  coder  called ñFYRð. It's  called ó"DREAM QUEST"ð and it's some  kind of  platform
  game with  puzzle elements. The  character  you controle is painted  in manga-
  style. The preview we've  seen looked really promising featuring  cool gfx and
  musics. ñPEGASEð plans to create several levels like EGYPT (that's the one we've
  seen), SOUTH AMERICA (a mayan temple), TRANSYLVANIA  and some  more... We will
  inform you when we get the promised preview.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1ALL FORMATS MONTHLY{*f0

- ó'All Formats Monthly'ð is a new multiformat magazine. It will  cover the Atari,
  Amiga, PC, 8-Bit computers and  consoles. There  will  be 'in-dept' interviews
  with 'the most  famouse computer people in the world'. 'Programming Workshops'
  are promised. Issue One  will feature an interview with ñIan Bellð, co-author of
  ó"ELITE"ð (not the cracking band... :-).

- óATOS issue 3 1998ð has  been released  featuring  some  articles by  our fellow
  writer ñPARANOIDð.

  largest YM-Sound collection up to now...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ó"BINLINER"ð is  reactived and  will be  a big demo again... ñTATð claimed that it

- ñTATð released a 128 byte intro called ó"ARUNDHATI ROY"ð for Falcon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1ATARI.ORG DOMAIN{*f0

- ñHACKBEARð (ex òDELTA FORCEð) had this domain for a while but didn't use it.
  The guys from òFATAL DESIGNð from Britain managed it to get hold of this domain.
  They want to build the ó"ultimate atari resource"ð on the Internet. Since  a few
  weeks/months there are now several virtual domains, for example:

  ó-http://dhs.atari.orgð

{*f1BLIND IO{*f0

- This new  swedish coder has  released a single  screen included in  the latest
  óMAGGIEð stuff folder. He  claims that it  would have looked impressive  5 years
  ago... better you add 5 years more, then it would have looked impressive...
  Anyway I'm  glad to  see new guys who are starting to code  Assembler... Check
  out the review:
  >--> BLIND IO <--<                                                                {*\BLINDIO.TXT}
- He is also working on a Tetris game (I can already hear someone crying that we
  are news-thieves now!)
- UPDATE: He has recently released a new 128byte-tro leechable at:
          ówww.helgo.net/mikael/files/music128.lzhð

- And another 128 byte intro  popped up, coded by ñDEFJAMð again and it's 'just' a
  3D starfield and you can find our review at:
  >--> 3D STARS <--<                                                                  {*\STARS.TXT}
- Latest  news! They  want  to  organize together  with òESCAPEð the  next  german
  easter party! Because the old organizers of the óSILICONventionð don't want to
  organize a new party they have taken over this job... so five years after the
  last óDRESDEN CODING CONVENTIONð another  Atari -only- Party will take  place in
  DRESDEN, the hometown  of the bands mentioned above. Join the mailing list at:
  óatarirules@hotmail.comð!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
{*f1CPU LOVE{*f0

- Another new swedish label  which released a first demo on Falcon, called ó"WHEN
  óDREAMS COME HOME"ð. Strange  but one  of the  members  is ñOPUSð of òCOLLAPSEð. The
  other known member is called ñFUZZKIDð.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1CREAM{*f0

- ñTAOð finished a new tune for ñLEONARDð's credit screen of the ó"NOSTALGIC-O DEMO"ð.
- ñTAOð made 984 bytes-musics for òDHSð and òMYSTIC BYTESð.
- òRESERVOIR GODSc pages revealed  that they work  on a new  Megademo for ST which
  should have 'Falcon quality effects'! This seems to be complete Nonsens. Their
  demo ó"...DO THINGS"ð will be a music and gfx demo comparable to ó"SONGS...2"ð and
  I'm afraid we didn't got a working copy in time...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1CROFT SOFT{*f0

- In  the  end  of last  year they  have  released a  game  called ó"MOLE MAYHEM"ð

  ó"SPACEBOT"ð. This one is INTERGALACTIC - PLANETARY!
  Review at:
  >--> SPACEBOT <--<                                                                {*\SPACEBOT.TXT}

  used that programm for PC coded by ñDANNY O.ð of òRISKð.

  soon open a  website to download that stuff. The  module  compile will feature
  some modules by his brother ñP3RK3L3ð!
- ñTRANTICð released  together  with ñP3RK3L3ð a small game called ó"SUURSY MRI"ð and

{*f1D.H.S.{*f0

- ó"GEMDEMO Vo.4"ð has been released in association with ñOZKð of òASSEMSOFTð.
- A few days after they released version óVo.5ð of their ó"GEMDEMO"ð.
- WOW! They made  5 new  releases  at óIMParty 7ð! ó"THE X-MIX 1/2/3"ð, ó"CHIPPIN FOR
  óAIR 5"ð and their long awaited STE demo ó"MASSACRE"ð. Check out all our reviews
  at the following lines...

- A few days after óQUASTð they released their finally finished 4k  called ó"4ORCE"ð
  and you can find our view on it at:
  >--> 4ORCE <--<                                                                   {*\4ORCE.TXT}
- Unbelievable  but they are  working again  on a demo and it  seems that it will
  beat ó"DREAM DIMENSION"ð! Also a new mindblowing 4k is in the pipeline.
- ñEVILð is also working on an ST demo featuring grafics from ñEDOð of òSECTOR ONEð.
- ñEVILð started a module-archive containing all the musics from all Falcon and ST
  demos ever done...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1EFFECT{*f0

- Regarding to ñTRONICð no one is active on ST anymore. òEFFECTð is DEAD!
- ñTRONICð claimed  if he  had a  harddrive, he  would  be so  active... but ñAtari
  Harddrives  are that  cheap nowadays so this is a worse  excuse! Maybe another
  point could be that many members of the band went inactive, changed the system
  or left the band because of other reasons.
- ñTRONICð was busted!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1ELITE{*f0

- ñMARCERð is searching for a record deal! He has rent a studio and produced up to
  10 Songs! He told us that it's mainly Euro-Dance.
- They have opened a new FTP :-)
- ñORBYð hacked ó"RUNNING"ð and ó"CROWN OF CREATION"ð some months ago and he announced
  to release them both to the public soon.

  -óNED Player v3.1 (English version)ð
  -óDirCompare v2.06 (German version)ð
  -óCD Reader v1.15 (German version)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1ESCAPE{*f0

- ñNOð has  released  another  strange  Falcon  demo, called ó"ILLNESS AT NIGHT ANDð
  óSHACKLED SHEEPS"ð. It made the third place at the óQUAST PARTY 1998ð demo compo.
  Check out the review:
  >--> ILLNESS AT NIGHT... <--<                                                     {*\ILLNESS.TXT}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1EXA{*f0

- Nearly all members joined òCENTEKð to work on the óPhenixð and óDolmen OSð.
- After the  release of the  preview from ó"K"ð the game  is lying  on ice  at the
  moment.
- ñFLANð is now painting  for the PC group òBOMBð (former  atarians... like ñZAPPYð of
  òHOLOCAUSTð or ñDJAMMð of òEKOð.).
- They have coded a óPhenixð Debugger called ó"CENTINEL"ð.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1FAEN{*f0

- This is the label of the czech disk magazine ó"NARSIL"ð. The latest issue (# 27)
  was released in August in cooperation with several czech Atari fanatics.
  Unfortunately it's written in czech language only. Check out our review of the
  issue 26 which popped up already in June...
  >--> NARSIL # 26 <--<                                                             {*\NARSIL.TXT}
- Raaa! óISSUE 28ð of the magazine popped up... it's bi-monthly!
- Btw. this magazine is done with heavy support of ñEMPTY HEADð of òHEADACHE PROJECTð.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1FOUNDATION TWO{*f0

- All coding activities on ñST/FALCONð are stopped at the moment
- Therefore  ñMAD BUTSCHERð is  now doing  games  on óAtari XLð. Recently  he  has
  released his first game called ó"TAIFUN"ð and it some sort of Shanghai-clone. It
  was featured on one of the last ñABBUCð Clubdiscs.
- The next XL-game called ó"BEMBEL WO"ð is under construction.
- There will  soon be a ñFOUNDATION TWOð-homepage where you can download all their
  games including ó"SUNSHINE"ð, ó"DRYEGG"ð and ó"TAIFUN"ð.
- UPDATE: A new Falcon game is under construction!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1FREEZERS{*f0

- Their announced óQUASTð Falcondemo has not shown up...
- We don't know if this was the reason, but ñCEDYNð left the group.
- We got also the information that ñYONEKð joined the PC demo band òAMNESTYð. So the
  'inofficial' Falcon section  of the òFREEZERSð is dead  and this short  history,
  just based on rumours at all found his end.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{*f1FUN{*f0

- ñEARXð released a Falcon demo  at óQUASTð party, that also contained effects coded
  by ñLoST/òINTERð. The  demo goes by the  name ó"FUNGLE BEATS"ð and made  the second
  place. Ofcourse there is a review included:
  >--> FUNGLE BEATS <--<                                                            {*\FUNGLE.TXT}
- ñBONUSð has  released  the latest  preview of  his violent  little  game  called
  ó"MEN AT WAR"ð. The music  is now done  by ñTOODELOOð of òDHSð. Also new  features have

   enough, and here finally is the logo of the game.
   As you can  probably not read it, the game is called ó"Breakdance"ð. Some might
   still  know the game  from the good  old C64 or Atari XL, but this  time it's
   going to be  remixed quite good. Await  a nice soundtrack  by ñLBKEð, graphics
   by myself  with some help from Strange and  lousy code by  myself. Don't take
   this all too  serious, it's just going to be another small game by a mixed up
   mind."

  game ó"WARCRAFT"ð. The whole intro  stuff is already finished (with the  help of
  òSYNDROMEð, a french Amiga band). Anyway it's a big  mystery when the  game will
  be finished, because it's a horrible big project and thought for release on CD
  ROM only. A preview was shown at óJEM'98ð but didn't reach our hands until now..
