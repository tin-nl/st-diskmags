Hi to all!


Welcome  my textzapping  friend to another  article that  might be  giving you a
little insight in what happened on a  not too small computer party  in the north
of France. The ñJEMð.
JEM  stands for  ñJOURNEES EUROPEENNES DU MULTIMEDIA!ð Wow! What  a name! ...„h...
wot does it mean? Who cares anyway... We haven't feared any costs to report live
from  one of the summer events  where you can still meet atarians. You will hate
yourself when you hear what you have missed... or thank god that you have stayed
at home!?! :-)

Friday  the  7th  of august: Around  18 o'clock  ñMad Butscherð from  ñFoundation 2ð
arrived at my  place. We took all my stuff and fitted  the whole  equipment into
the car.
ñMad Butscherð came up  with an important  question: "Do you have a french adapter
for the  power socket?" - Shit, I nearly  forgot  that! I grabbed the  phone and
called ñScy/tSCcð who got  those adapters the  last two years when we attended the
Gigafun. ñScyð told me that he has  one adapter and  he could lend  this one to me
for the weekend. Now, we headed for òStražbourgð!
After one  hour of an  odyssey through òFranceð we arrived at the  partyplace. The
place  was twice as big as last year  and they  had a  number of  internet-lines
online all the time.

They had 2 big  halls. In the  first hall, where the ñGigafunð was placed, all the
democrews  settled down. In the second hall  they placed  the óGigaplayð with more
than  20 machines  connected  to a  network of  Quake-playing  addicts. Also the
Internet-machines were  placed here. ñAppleð was one of the sponsers of the party,
so it was not surprising that there were lotsa òMAC PERFORMAð machines to surf the
net with.

After some  minutes I met ñST Survivor/Loudð! and he showed me the  latest version
of their ñBack in Franceð demo which should be released at the party.
I've also recognized following guys from what we call atari scene:

ñST Survivor, Thyrex/Loud!ð
òHello, ST Ghost, Exyl, Dma Sc, Edo/Sector 1ð
óSine/Idemlineð
ñZigo, Flan/Exað
òCentek (various guys)ð
óPegase/Adrenalineð
ñSeb & STabylo/The removersð
òBoub, G-Hell/Popsy teamð
óIridium (2 guys)ð
ñParanoid, Mark/Paranoiað
òMad Butcher/Foundation Twoð
óMC Laser/The Sirius Cybernetics Corp. (me :-)ð
ñSenser/Supremacy^Thyphoon^Vexð
òHylst/Cerebral Vortexð
óFroST (single coder)ð
ñFrench Falcon Clubð
òCk3 (single coder)ð
óSgt. Slayer/Atrocityð

There were  also some  more guys I already don't  know the  names of. All in all
there were around  40 atarians. Nearly the same  amount of freaks  that attended
the ñInterjamð two months  ago. Why can't we  arrange a party  where all the  guys
could get together?

ñEdoð from òSector 1ð showed  me a  ó.tSCc.ð logo and  some  other graphics  that he
made. A really great 16-colors ñST KNIGHTSð logo were also among those.
ñSine/Idemlineð copied me his latest GFA-96k for ST  called òTANKERZONEð  and showed
me some preview of a forthcoming Falcondemo from him called óSweet Valleyð.
I've copied lotsa  modules and also  a chiptune from ñDMA SC/Sector 1ð who started
with  tormenting  the òAnimal Mine Sidsounddesignerð since a little  while. Really
promising at all. (Hey ñDma Scð: "Funky-Zak rules!").
ñParanoidð showed me  some preview of óBreakdanceð, their forthcoming  scene-game...
It was really funny seeing ñLlama/tSCcð doing the electric boogie :-)

In the late night I leeched óMaggie 26ð at one of the internet-terminals... Then I
wanted  to meet  the mates  from my  group  on IRC ò#atariscneð but  they were not
there... After reading the interesting òMaggieð parts I searched for some sleep...
On the big  screen behind us  the frenchmen  showed some funny videos similar to
the  FAR OUT-stuff  showed at the ñSILIconventionð! TERROR in  french!!! Btw, they
killed òSAILOR MOONð!!!

Saturday the 8th of august: I woke up at around 10  o'clock. I made myself a cup
of tea (Wow, and I'm no englishman!) and continued working on this article.
ñLoud!ð were  still busy  working  on the ó'Back in France'ð demo. Later on  we went
down to ñMcDonaldsð and I  tell you there  were lots of  hot chicks who  wanted to
have a huge dick fitted in their pussies... oops... I went off the topic ;-)
Anyway ñMcDonaldsð in ñFranceð  is alot better than in òGermanyð...
When we  came back  the intro  competition was held. Unfortunatly  ñSine/Idemlineð
was the only guy who gave an intro to the organisers. So what do you think? Yes,
he won! Right  after that the  music competition  was held. The entries were not
very  impressive.  To be  precise,  there  was  some  really  shitty  crap  only
containing  french speech samples... lame! Only some of  them  were  really good
such as the one from ñDma Sc/Sector 1ð.
ñST Survivorð showed  me a  new version  of  the upcoming  game from ñLOUD!ð  called
óTHE TRACEð. It's  some sort  of tron-clone for ST with good  gfx from ñST Survivorð
and code by ñThyrexð. The game also features fantastic chipzix by ñ505/Checkpointð.

Late in the  night I met  my pals from ñ.tSCc.ð on IRC ò#atarið. After a few minutes
ñGreyð joined  us and  also ñmOdð from ñ.tSCc.ð, who  won the  gfx-compo at  the ñQuastð
party. He sent me  the picture via DCC. It's a portait of the german slut called
ñBlmchenð. At  the same  time the ñGigapartyð, a  techno-oriented-party, started in
the hall  beneath  the big  hall where the ñGigafunð and the ñGigaplayð were placed.
ñParanoidð told me that  no one was there and so I suppose it wasn't  that 'GIGA'.
:-)

I talked for a while with ñPEGASE/ADRð and he showed me  his new Falcon game he is
working on  called óDREAM QUESTð. It's a platform game with fucking nice graphics.
He also showed  me lotsa musics he did. Some of them were chip music conversions
from old MSX-games.

I can't remember when but some time ñThyrexð from ñLoud!ð came to my place and asked
for a disk to copy me óBack in Franceð! "Is it released?" I asked. He said yes and
we went  to his place to copy the demo. Cool! A new demo! We've  waited for ages
for this one. I think that was the highlight from the party.
Check out moondog's review at:

>--> BACK IN FRANCE <--<                                                            {*\BIFFINAL.TXT}

Late in the night they began to show Falcon demos on the big screen. It was nice
to  see óDREAM DIMENSIONð, òSONOLUMINESZENZð, ñOBNOXIOUSð and óLOST BLUBBð again on such
a big  screen (...it was a lot bigger than on the ñInterjamð...). In the middle of
the room  the realtime article from ñToxic Magð  was placed... Most of the entries
were in  french... So It  was not such interesting for me. I only made one short
entry.

Sunday the 9th of august: Not much too tell about this day, because we  left the
party at around 12 o'clock. I can only guess how many people attended the party.
I think there were around 200 guys present from Atari, Amiga and PC Scene.
I have heard that they presented the demos right after we had left. Damn!
There was the  preview from ñSine/Idemlineð's first  Falcondemo and a preview from
the Command and Conquer-clone for the Falcon from ñPOPSY TEAMð. We hope to get the
preview on our hands soon...

All in all the party was much better than in 1997. I think  there were more guys
who attended  the party than  last year. The entrance  fee, 150 Franc, was a bit
high for normal users but they had to pay the net-connection with the money.
One of the organizers from the ñFrench Falcon Clubð told me that they want to burn
a ñJEM'98ð CDRom with all the graphics, musics and the few demos for Atari and PC.
He also told me that they want to include AVI-files from the PC demos so that  a
Falcon user  could watch them on his machine :-) PC Emulation on Falcon is  that
easy  ;-) They also shot fotos and filmed the party.
I hope that  these pictures and movies will also be included. The CD should come
out within the next two months and I guess it's already released when this issue
of Undercover reaches the eyes of the world...

Here are some of the results:

- msx  : 1st ñDMA SC/sector oneð 
- gfx  : 1st òFLAN/Exað 
         2nd óEDO/sector oneð 
- 96Ko : ñSine/idemlineð (only pretender) 
- demos: òBouB/Popsy Teamð with a presnetation of his Falcon game
         ñSine/Idemlineð 'óSWEET VALLEYð' preview  

That's  all. Hope you  enjoyed reading  this unimportant  contribution  to  this
magascene.
