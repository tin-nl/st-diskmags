Quast? What's a Quast? For all the readers who have absolutely no idea what this
is: it's  an anual  copy/coding  party for  ATARI in  Poland. It has  been going
strong for  a few years  now and this edition promised to  be bigger and  better
than the last ones.

Indeed  the organisers  had all  kinds of new things planned  for us atarians. A
bigger partyplace, securityguards  and even some pretty girls collecting garbage
(sounds  bizarre enough?). Curiously  enough  the organisers  also seem  to have
thought making the party multiformat was an advantage.

Anyway, let's  start from the arrival at the trainstation in  Elbag. Grey/MB and
me  went  looking for  the bus. Bus? No bus..?.. Only a  group of  disorientated
tourists where public transport was supposed to be. Tourists? Hold on..
Hey! They looked familiar! Yes! They were 505, mOd and No + pretty girlfriend.

We  embarked  upon  a great  journey  through  a  mystic town  known a s Elblag.
Ocassionally  tripping  over  stairs (with monitor), running  after  busses  and
asking for directions we made our way to the big gym hall.

Once inside  we put down  our stuff in a corner along with some other  atarians.
The main hall was really BIG! Probably 4 times as big as the one in Interjam'98.
In the  middle was  a giant projectorscreen and scattered  throughout  the place
were groups  of 8- & 16/32-bit Atari freax, but also  Amiga people and  PC users
(bugger!).

The good thing  was that probably more than half of all machines were Atari. The
bad  thing  ofcourse  was  that  there  were  loads  of  PC-users and even worse
commercial  people  promoting  PCs to  the  public! Blech! Horror! I  think  the
sponsors  also  were the  reason  the 90% of the time  PC-demos were  played  on
screen.

A load of  bad news most Atari people  agreed. But certainly not all was bad. As
said above the security was really professional and I'm sure this helped prevent
mishaps  like at  the Siliconvention'97 where various  hardware  was stolen  and
trashed up (!) Also  there was  plenty of  room to sleep and  food + drinks were
available at the place itself.

As atarians  had installed  their  machines, interesting  stuff  was  now  being
displayed. There was a jag with Iron Soldier 2 and a new formula 1 game. Sqward/
MB was  coding non-stop  on his  new masterpiece as were the  Swedish guys  busy
doing various demoeffects (and making dirty jokes :)).

The 8-bit dudes ignored everyone and were focussing on their little keyboards. I
really  dig  their  spirit. Not  being  distracted  by  anything (including  the
sponsors  boasting  their  Gatesmobile  machines). Complete  devotion  to  their
computer! Coolness!

Also in  the building  was Pazkud. A hardwaremaker and reseller from  Poland. He
offered selfmade  Falcon memory expansions and IDE controllers for the ST/Falcon
cartridgeport. Quite  professional  stuff. Greenious bought one IDE-adaptor  and
Grey a memory upgrade.

Somewhere in the big hall was also a crappy old PC serving as a realtime article
machine. Most  of the  time it  was being tortured by the hands of  PC-users and
furthermore  most  of  the scriblings  were  in  Polish.. MMhhh.. I  dunno, it's
probable we won't see the realtime articles in UCM13 :)

Getting back  to the atariscene stuff.. Later on the first day people started to
show  some  of the  to-be-released  things. mOd/TSCC  showed  my his  completely
stunning  compopicture! My eyes popped out. The amount of detail in the  320*200
128 colour picture was ñAMAZINGð!

Later on I  was shown the two releases by Mystic Bytes: the early version of the
fabulous "Teardrop" demo and the 4-ktro they prepared in one (!) day.
Both looked  very good. Especially  the demo looked smashing. I knew  right that
the first place in the democompetion was going to belong to the Mystic Bytes. No
question, this was hot stuff.

Escape still didn't want to show their demo, cos it was intended completely as a
suprise and sadly Baggio's ST-demo was lost, cos of a fucked up harddisk. Hmmmm.
what else was there to do?

A quick  look  around  wouldn't hurt.. Some  Atarians  from the  Czech  republic
unpacked  their stuff on  the tables next to us. Satantronic brought  their 65XE
8-bit and Falcon  in a towercase. Funny there also seems to be a  Atari scene in
Czech. I heard they had annual meetings and I read their printed magazine and it
was  quite good. Loads  of in-depth  stuff and howto-articles  about coding  and
making music.

On the Falcon  they had, was a preview of K, the forthcoming mariokart game from
EXA. And it  was òCOOLð to say the least! Cute animated figures really  well drawn
and  damn  smooth  3d-graphics. Wow! If  this game  will  ever  comes  out it'll
probably reach the same fame as Running or Moongames.

For the rest, there wasn't that much to do. Loads of craptalking with Grey, mOd,
and the  other guys  was the  main  activity. Sometimes it became a  bit hard to
understand  eachother. The hall was equipped with two MASSIVE  speaker-sets. And
trust me, the organisers didn't leave them unused :)
Loud techno/goa-music exploded into the partyplace.

When craptalking  became too hard there was always  a Falcon free  to use (thanx
505! :)) for coding some small routines. Otherwise you could go out to the local
shop to get some drink and food.

                              -< ñthe competionsð >-

Ok, if I remember correctly the first competion was the graphics competion.
Anyway: it had  an incredible  amount of entries. Seventeen I  recall. And these
were  only  the  truecolor  ones  (Falcon, PC,  amiga  AGA). The  bigscreen  was
wellsuited for this. It was the sharpest I've seen so far.

The entries  were displayed and some  cheers appeared here and there. It went by
quickly and I  made out this: there were two bad entries. Simply  lacking detail
or party raytraced (LAME!). I guess 4 or 5 were really great stuff.
Unique style, completely  pixelled and excellent composition. And yes, mOd's was
one of those. The rest was let's say: good, but didn't have that special edge.

After 17 pictures, I didn't  notice the  rest that much. There was  some C64 and
Atari 8bit  stuff, but I  was kinda numbed right then. The most  important thing
was that  mOd's picture won the competion! Yes! The only Atari entry  out of the
17 pictures won! Coolness. Big happiness for mOd and the rest of the Atariscene.
Tough luck for the Amiga people who looked like having a chance :)
Here it comes...

{*i jasmin.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

If my brain was  not completely dead due to lack of sleep, it must have been the
multichannel music-competion that was next up. Big dissapointment here.
505/Checkpoint  made an  entry, but they didn't play  it!! That  was  crap! They
could at least let the contenders know that there were too many entries to play.
(more than 20!)

The  played tunes were mostly  techno stuff  again. Maybe there were  some other
styles  in  there  too, but  it  was  definetely  clear  that  techno/goa/trance
influences were  very strong. Phew! After 5 songs your ears were  already bored,
tired and simply not willing to take anymore. The next 15 were pure torture.

There also were some 4 channel modules, which I completely refused to listen to.
And then there  were some SIDsounds. Nice stuff. The lights in the hall were now
dimmed and some people started dancing in front of the big screen.
Well.. dancing? Maybe just waving your arms and legs spasticly  to the beat. Was
really funny to see the atmosphere was good.

Some SIDsounds  were damn good, some  others were just the below average. Mostly
the beats and melodies were catchy and uptempo. The Atari 8bit soundchip (pokey)
has just  like the SID, an unique type of sound. The beats are mostly harder and
overall it's more manic.

Still the POKEY  competion didn't  get people moving as hard as the SIDsounds as
the songs  mostly weren't that catchy. Just a bit rougher, mostly at the cost of
the  melodies. Nevertheless, nice  hearing  people  putting this unique  chip to
work.

Later  on (next  night) were  the  PC and Amiga  competions. Only  a few  words:
tunnels, loads of environment mapped objects, synchronised to quite rough techno
music. The PC stuff  was shown on a big fat pentagram machine with whatever crap
hardware they have in it today.

The PC demos  were fast and  smooth, well  synchonised, but  ALL THE SAME. 12 PC
demos and  not one of them  original! Complete horror! Blech! The Amiga releases
were somewhat better. Still they required fastram and a 040/060 in order to run.
Mostly  the demos  seemed a like PC  ones. Not much  originality. Only  that the
Amiga guys have a harder job to do with coding and that they have a better scene
are reasons to respect them.

I don't want to waste anymore time with the PC/Amiga stuff. It was boring to say
the least. After seeing 20 demos that are completely alike, you grow insane with
boredom. (flashy  stylish titles, wormhole tunnels  with generated textures, 3d-
envmap  objects in them, techno music, syncing.. Flashy logo's  pulsating in the
corners.. the same every fucking time.. ARG! Not one single entry was original!)

Straight  onto the  important  stuff: Atari  demos: There  were  three: Escape's
"Illness at night", Mystic Bytes' "Teardrop" and FUN's (my crew! :)) demo called
"fungle beats".

It was really  stupid that  these demos  were shown last.. The falcon is  a slow
machine  compared to paintium's and 040/060 amigas! This caused  most people not
to cheer at all, cos they were completely numbed by all the damn PC-demos.

First, ñTEARDROPð was  shown. A great  demo in it's finished  version. Even better
than  the early version I saw. Cool effects zooming synced  logo's, blurring 3d-
distorted  bumpmap  (quite  wild  one  this). Distorting  textures  with  little
"fireflies" over  them. The  music was wild  and in  an unique style by XTD. And
ofcourse mOd's compopicture was put in there. (couldn't miss :))

Secondly  my  demo was shown. òFUNGLE BEATSð. I'll not lose words  on  this one. I
can't judge something  I made  you know. Hopefully a review  further on  in this
issue of UCM will bring some info.

óILLNESS AT NIGHT AND SHACKLED SHEEPð (*gulp*) was  the  full  title  of  Escape's
entry. And  what an entry. I'd been looking forward to this one quite some time.
Especially since No (the coder) refused to show it to me :)

Let's  say that  it was  a shocked  afair. First a  very  pretty  logo  comes up
blending  with colorgradients. Looks  stylish.. The thing is accompanied  by low
noises. Then... BAM! All of a sudden the music explodes into hardcore techno.
Hardhitting bass bounced through the hall. Quite a few people awoke upon hearing
this :-> Words flash over a plasma background accompanied by stylish 2d-vectors.
After that a more  relaxed and quite original part starts. Really  nice waveform
distorting patterns and the music is puntuated with an TOS keyclick sound! Kewl!

But after that  appears are really vague picture of a big  fat naked woman being
hopelessly  distorted by  one of No's crazy effects. And hold on to  your helmet
right now: Really  hard screams  fly out of the speakers! People were  scared to
death!!!! :)) And so was I. My mouth just flew open with amazement.
Chugga chugga kerrang! lofi metal  guitars finish  the whole  thing off. The fat
woman explodes into a rain of blurred rainbow dots and the demo was over.

Phew! That was it.. I gotta say  I never expected  a demo like this. It  is both
enjoyable as  original. But it suprised me so little people liked it. Almost the
only original thing on the whole party and well put toghether.
Hell.. maybe most people just don't share the same taste.
Check out pAranoid's review:

>--> ILLNESS... <--<                                                                {*\ILLNESS.TXT}

Still.. technicly and in terms of design, Mystic Bytes' effort was  superior. It
was the longest demo and it was probably the best synced affair I've ever seen.

Except for all the craptalking and amazement about the polish scene and checking
out other atari's, the democompetion was by far the most exciting event.

After that was over.. there  were some  other things.. Atari 8bit intro's (which
were impressive) and the Mystic Bytes superlong 4KTRO.
Again there is a review by pAranoid to find there...

>--> FURY 4K <--<                                                                   {*\FURY.TXT}

Ofcourse more  PC crap like 4ktros and 256bytros was boring as usual. So instead
of boring  you readers to death with lame  shit, let's  continue with  some more
interesting events..

At a sudden  moment we (mOd, 505 and me) tried to get acces to the  IRC machines
(darn PCs  ofcourse). They were plagued by lamers who wanted to leach sexpics or
warez or  whatever. Anyway, after a long wait mOd managed to get hold of one and
immediately started IRC #atari/#atariscne.

To our suprise  Maggie26 was now released!! Wow! mOd got hold of  some disks and
leached. We  ran of  to our  Ataris and  it was  fun.. All  of them  now  showed
Maggie26. Nice the release was at the same time as the party. It made  trying to
keep your eyes open a bit easier.

The next day (last one), was cool because I got to see the new demo from Syntax.
An ST-demo  doing impressive texturemapping with quite complex  abjects. And not
even  slow  at  that! Plus  there  was some  humour  and  really  nice  original
greetings.
Finally there is again a review included... by moondog...

>--> SOMETIMES BUBBLEBEES... <--<                                                   {*\SYNTAX.TXT}

That was the  last highlight  of the whole thing.. After that it was  packing up
our stuff and moving back to our livingplaces.

                            -< ñthis is the endð >-

I'd like to say something about the overall party:

plusses:

Big hall
Security
Sleeping places
Many atari's
Many Nationalities Atarians (Polish, German, Swedish, Czech, Dutch)
Shops nearby
Quite some atari releases (3 falcon demos, 1 4ktro, 1 st demo)
Loads of friendly atarians
Interesting 8bit atarians
Big audio installation
Cool attitude (people dancing to SID)

drawbacks:

Some unfriendly people outside of the building (threw stuff at us!)
Lame organisers (only for the money, too much PC commercials)
Big audio installation :)))
Really hard to find partyplace
No alcohol allowed inside (though there were ways around this ;-))

That's it  and that's that. Overall: A great experience. I would rate it as: not
so good as Siliconvetion'97, but far better than Interjam'98.
I heard some Polish atarians mumble about the good old days of QUAST being Atari
only. And  also some rumours about a new party in 1999 for  Atari only! If so: I
will definetely join again and can reccomend it to any Atari freak as well!
