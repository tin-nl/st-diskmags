                   "ONLY WHEN I LOSE MYSELF" by DEPECHE MODE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maxi single, released by Mute 1998

Finally, after one and a half year the gods are back, just with  this single for
their forthcoming Singles Collection 1986-1998.
This single was thought as EP at first but it seems as the band was  running out
of ideas, because there are just three songs included, three new songs ofcourse.
There was also a remix-single released but I don't got hold of it so far...
Ok... on this single are the following songs:

o1 - Only When I Lose Myself
o2 - Surrender
o3 - Headstar

Ok... as always my critics to the single songs.

Only When... is just a slow ballad, typical for later DeMo ballads, but not with
    the former  massive synthie-stuff or  solo guitar by  Martin Gore... I don't
    understand the move to take this song for a single. It isn't a typical DeMo-
    single  song, just  like "Barrel Of A Gun" or "It's No Good". It  hasn't the
    right  and known  top-hit-style. The best sign  for this  loss is  that this
    single started on place 2 of the german  top 1oo but left even the top 1o in
    the second  week after its appearance... The not so  fanatic DeMo  fans will
    surely think twice befor bying it. It's for me just a question of fanatism..
    
Surrender... this song  reminds me to  their old S.O.F.A.D. album, better to the
    single "Condemnation" with  the bonus track "Death's Door". Also a very slow
    song, too slow. Ok... it's not a bad song but still not a typical DeMo song,
    I don't like it very much.
    
Headstar... the last one, again  a slow  song (what else?! errr...) and  just an
    instrumental track  too. Grrrr... but hey... after a short time the sound is
    going a bit harder but without any hit-smash-style. Therefor the stuff which
    is dripping out of my speakers is too strange.
    
Hmmm, that's all. This  single don't reminds to their last  album "Ultra" in any
way and I say it: without any question it is one of the most  bad singles of the
latert  history of  DeMo. Ok. It's my  private opinion but be  sure, I was  very
angry after I bought it because  I was standing in the  shop, the DeMo single in
the one hand  and the new Pitchfork single, "Carnival" in  the other. Now I know
that not only the playlenght of the DeMo single isn't  a drawback (just 15 mins)
in comparison with the Pitchfork release... grrrr...
Anyway. I still hope that the next real album (not the announced Singles Collie)
will be not produced in  this style because I could lose my belief in the former
brilliance of this band!

There is a small  report of the DEPECHE MODE concert on the  1o.1o.1998 included

Over and out...
