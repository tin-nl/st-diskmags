Û                 "9.9.99 9 UHR" & "MASCHINENSTöRMER" by AND ONE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Virgin Records 1998

About one  year ago ÚAND ONE, _the_ german electro-pop band released Ò"NORDHAUSEN"
(the first  lifesign  since 4  years) under  their new label  VIRGIN. Now  their
second release popped up and surprised me in another way as you may think.

At first, they're  on the same  way as  with Ò"NORDHAUSEN", more  and more  funny
electro pop stuff, not  as on older  works  like Ò"I.S.T." or Ò"SPOT". It seems as
they have lost every little sense for the earnest things in life... (Gargl! Some
english guy  will surely find  out some proofs  for my depressive  state in this
line... shit... =) ...). I mean  with  the  time they're  on the  way to  be the
counterpart of the happy hardcore brainless shit in the techno scene  or all the
dull flowers-pop.

Therefore a second  CD is included, the long awaited Ò"MASCHINENSTöRMER" EP, with
some  tracks, created  by ÚSTEVE (the singer) alone, over a  very hard  style! It
sounds more like pure old school EBM stuff... cool! Those songs are a lot better
than the whole normal album itself. But before I will write more...

As you  can see they're singing  mainly in german  again. But I will  write this
review in  english because  several people  asked us  about  kicking all  german
articles out. So we will do it, at least if it's possible.
Ok, the regular  album contains a  lot of very simple  electro pop songs, in the
usual  ÛAND ONE style. The  same  beats, basslines, synthesizer  fields... and of
course the wellknown voice of ÚSTEVE.
This means not  that the album isn't good. As you may know ÛAND ONE are some kind
of the  leading german  band of this  music style. But  since Ò"NORDHAUSEN" a lot
changed, not  so good changes  for me. In former times they did some funny songs
too, just  remember Ò"TECHNOMAN" or Ò"DRIVING WITH MY DARLING". But with  the last
album  they released  a lot of  this stuff and I don't like it very much because
some of  them are  so fucking primitive, just  like Ò"SWEETY SWEETY" or Ò"ICH ESSE
ÒEIN BROT". But now they reached so underground areas that I can not believe what
I have to listen to... bleurgh! Therefore I will not write down the lyrics.
At first  they're mainly  in german and  second, for what?! They're so  dull and
without any deep, sometimes even without a meaning at all (said by themselve!).

Just my Ûprivate  favourites of the regular album... Ò"UND WIEDER" is  a very nice
pop ballad without dumb lyrics. Ò"MEN IN UNIFORM" is nice too, remembers a bit to
older stuff, slow, deep voices... just nice. Hm... ok, the first song is OK too,
but that's it! Not so good eh?!

Therefore the  bonus  EP Ò"MASCHINENSTöRMER" contains  several  very  interesting
songs. The  titles are sometimes  a bit strange but therefore we have  some very
good club titles  here, with Ò"HASSFABRIK" or Ò"TEUFEL ODER ENGEL". Very  fast and
unbelievable  hard, remembers a bit to the very early works of ÛAND ONE were they
have  done such  stuff too  from time  to time, just like Ò"DIE DEUTSCHMASCHINE",
Ò"SPONTANVERKEHR" or Ò"TANZ DER ARROGANZ".
This EP, not  as half as  long as the whole album, is at least double as good as
the album  itself! And I think  without this  bonus CD I don't  had bought  this
album!
Final words? It's hard to say. I think you should check it out before buying it!
If you  like the  old stuff  much more  and didn't  liked  even Ò"NORDHAUSEN" you
should get your fingers off this album.
But if you like funny and a bit senseless electro pop you try it out...
