The third part in the XMIX module compilation series and the  biggest at that. A
whopping ò3.4MBð is  required on your harddisk. It uses  the same shell as XMIX-I.
So if you want any info on that, please check out the review of:
>--> XMIX part I <--<                                                             {*\XMIXI.TXT}

The tunes  in here again  feature the  same polish as in  the last two episodes.
The music is quite varied, but mostly not my style or not so  well put toghether
as the previous XMIXes. Anyway, here are the tracks:

ñTrack 1:

Wow! Heavy shit! It seems to  be Melincollin. Yes, the ñSwedish punkersð! Or maybe
pop-punkers, cos I don't like  nowadays punk. Anyway, the òguitar-samplesð are ok,
but not so well synced.
But when you  think  the track is  over you  are treated  with some  chilled out
jazzy bass  music. A great  melody-line on the  piano. Sounds  a bit  like ñearly
ñnineties chilled out danceð. If the  song didn't  have  this part  put to it, I'd
give  the  track  a 2 or whatever, but  the  second  part  is so  great (and the
ócontrastð rules!). I'll have to give this no less than 9 OUT OF 10!

òTrack 2:

Oh.. Bugger! Damn ñclub-technoð again. I just  hate  this  music  with its  stupid
mellow  beats. It's  just no good  dance music. Also  I think  even if this is a
style  I  hate  the  track  could  have  been  slightly  better  composed.  Most
instruments are  ok, but  it has ñno energy or  good  melodyð and òneither  does it
òhave variationð. 4 OUT OF 10 just for the polish and the instruments.

óTrack 3:

Oh oh! Not  more ñclubð! What  is this?!? It  reminds  me of a club I once visited
where  they  played  this  horrible  genital-for-brain music. All people dressed
stupidly and moving their elbow (something called 'swinging' I believe). And the
"even cooler" people  in those  clubs stand  on the podium and  move their elbow
even harder. Oh lord! What is it with this kind of tasteless  music and people??
Blech! Their dance is about as boring and unvaried as the music..
On the  other hand  Toodeloo proves  he can  make this  kind  of  music  with no
problem (just use  your genitals instead of your brain ;-)). And quite  polished
and with "funky" instruments too. 4 OUT OF 10. For reasons see track 2.

ñTrack 4:

This one is  different. It  starts out  a bit childish, but  suddenly ñhard beatsð
kick in! It doesn't  sound completely  like the  stuff  you hear on  MTVs party-
zone. More  like  a òdemoscene tuneð actually. Well, since  it's  a  well-polished
demotune I'll hand out 7 out of 10.

òTrack 5:

Mmmhhhh.. ñVocals..ð Combined  with  strange  and  atmospheric óbackground  noisesð.
Some  strings  come  into the tune and good they are  too. Short, but good! Only
the end of the song sounds  a bit crappy. I'd say 6 out of 10.

óTrack 6:

ñFuNkY shitð! Maxwell? Ever  listened  to  it? Well, this  one  feautures a sample
from the  band. The samples are  great  I'd say! Again it is well polished (like
every other track in the XMIX series), but  this song needs some extra attention
to the melody line. It ain't much good. 5 out of 10.

ñTrack 7:

Oooooohhhh... 80's synthbassline. I like  that. Ofcourse, that isn't all. A very
good melody comes up. Catchy stuff! slighty  offbeat like some songs in XMIX-II.
This is a good original track and ñvery catchyð, so it deserves...
8 out of 10 points!

òTrack 8:

???? This takes 20 secs  to finally  start. What's wrong? The sounds starts very
softly. The first thing you can hear is a ñjazzy basslineð. Well done..
And  some ólaidback drumsoundsð also  join in. It's  not so variated this one, but
OK nevertheless and brilliantly polished. So 7 out of 10 goes to this one.

As you might  have figured  out, this  compilation is óless of a dancy afairð than
the last two XMIXes. A bad thing, because  the lack of pure  dance-adrenaline is
not made up for by good melodylines or complex patterns.
Toodeloos  standard amount  of polish is ofcourse  still here, but it doesn't do
that much good. After two XMIXes you've gotten used to it.

On the bright  side however, you could say that  the ñsamples are the bestð in the
whole series (this  being the final part). Hence the  whole compilation takes up
so much harddisk space.

Overall: Some good  tunes and loads of polish and  great samples, but XMIX-II is
still the best!
