And ófinallyð... here  it is! The longawaited óGFAð megademo  by òLOUD!ð, formerl also
known as òNO LIMIT CODINGð. As you  know òNLCð split up last year... at the one hand
there was formed òLOUD!ð by the active óSTSURVIVORð and óTHYREXð and at  the other òNLC
is still existing, but totally inactive.

This project was started in ñ1994ð by òNLCð and other french bands but with the time
all  others  disappeared and  just the  two guys  of òLOUD!ð were  left and  still
working on this project alone and when you see the demo now you can imagine what
a horrible work it was to finish the whole demo without any help of other guys.

I wrote already a preview for the last  ñUCMð and this preview version didn't work
correct on my machine (just on 2 MB or higher). Now, as I got the  final version
(which was released at the óJEM'98 PARTYð, the follow up to the óGIGAFUNð parties in
August in France) I thought the problems were be solved, I checked that the demo
still  doesn't run  correctly on my  STFM. So I borrowed a STE from a friend and
finally I can review the whole demo! Perhaps my ST has some problems, don't know
but as said in the demo itself there are still some bugs left.

Ok, enough crap written here, let's start with the review. ñ"BACK IN FRANCE"ð is a
megademo in the  òold styleð and if I'm right the first megademo since 1994 for ST
which was released  too, at least I can't  remember other megademos in the years
after the big crash in the ST scene.
Ok, there were  several projects  started but I can't remember that only one was
finished in time. So it's a cool thing to have again a demo with intro, mainmenu
and several  screens you can chose by yourself and even a hidden screen is there
too! óSo the old vibe comes back!

It's strange  but for several  years no one had the  power to create  such a big
demo and because all  liked the multipart stuff much more no one wanted  to do a
megademo again. I was a bit bored too because also many megademos appeared which
don't impressed me so much, again and again with the same game-look-a-like menus
and only the same effects etc.
Now I'm very happy to see a òclassic megademoð  again and not to forget  this kind
of demos only was spreaded right on the ST and so it's  some kind of typical for
this machine. I will review all the screens after another... It's the first time
that I can do this again since years! óCool!

ó1. THE INTRO

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñmsx    - Mad Max / TEX

After a short  loading time a very ócoolð and óniceð òNLCð logo appears on the screen,
drawn by one of the most promising new comer grafists on ST, óSTSurvivorð. Also an
old  and wellknown  chipmusic  starts to  play. After the logo the  screen turns
black and a "present", made  of dots zoomes in, followed  by another nice  logo,
saying ñ"BACK IN FRANCE"ð.
Last but not  least a starfield  appears in the  background and a  textdisplayer
with green font brings some information about the demo to the screen.
All together very ñold stylishð, but with nice grafix!

ó2. THE MAIN MENU

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñmsx    - Lotus / Hotline

After pressing  space the mainmenu appears on the  screen. It shows nice colours
with the two faces of the makers in comic  style. A nice chipzik  with digidrums
start to play and  you can chose one  of four different  screens while using the
mouse or keyboard...
This menu is the new one, in former times a Wings Of Death  look-a-like menu was
included but removed. For just four  screens this menu does the  job because you
must not search hours for them...
óNice stuffð with a little touch of deja-vu.

ó3. LOADER

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!

What?! There  is just a  small logo  on the  screen, saying "loading"... In  the
preview I have there  was a big dotssphere in style of  the ñ"FROGGIES"ð demo with
musix by  óJESSð of the òOverlandersð  included but it  made too  much problems with
the memory... snifff... anyway  the loader  does his job too. It isn't  the main
thing on a megademo (in comparison with multiparts where  an interrupt loader is
needed for running one screen after another wihtout unstylish breaks...)

ó4. BEYOND IMAGINATION

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñ       - Flan / Exa
ñmsx    - Jess / Overlanders
ñ       - Lap / Next

This is the mainpart and a multipart too. It contains a lot  of effects and so I
will write down all the things happened on my screen the next minutes...
At first a title logo appears, drawn by óSTSurvivorð again, and  without any doubt
another ònice pieceð of work! The nice chip music by óJessð, known from the good old
ñ"FROGGIES OVER THE FENCE"ð starts to play  and the  show starts  with a one plane
NLC logo, distorting  in the  middle of  the screen  with a  bobs field on black
background. Not bad...
At next a warning appears, saying that the demo ò1oo % Assembler freeð! Hehe...
The  show  goes on with  a ñraster  zoomð with  two penguins, drawn  by óSTSurvivor
again (who else?!) and a  small scroller. You can  move the  rasterzoom with the
cursor keys too. It's an ñold effectð but still nice to watch.
The screen colour is changing now by a rasterbar coming from above. Design! =)
Another message is  displayed, again  with a nice  font, just saying you have to
move your ass instead watching this demo!
A blue rasterbar comes from  below to  change the background  colour again and a
small scroller comes up. This screen is dedicated to  óSgt Slayerð of òAtrocityð and
displays ñ4 bouncing gelee ballsð of different diameters. Nice screen too.
At next a green haired  guy comes up, painted  by óSTSurvivorð  again, followed by
a ñrealtime splineð on a nice styled background.
Again a message comes up, just  saying ó"Hiroshima 45, Tchernobyl 85, Windows 95"
(hehe... someone outthere who don't likes PC, eh?!) and  a ñbouncing  sphereð made
of shaded bobs appears.
The screen turns  now black again, a small box is displayed in  the center and a
ñflexiscrollð is coming up... erm... the oooould days =)
Now a  little advert for the  óToxic Magð comes  up on the  screen, followed by an
other cool screen. On the left side you can see a joker with  the message ó"Enjoy
óLife"ð and on the  left side a strange effect was shown  I can't  describe at the
moment... sorry... therefore here comes a screenshot... =)

{*i bif1.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

Another  big  picture, showing an  Atari logo  with a little  dragon, painted by
STSurvivor again comes  up, the  screen turns  violet and two vectors  with one-
plane  textures, saying ó"Intel Outside"ð are displayed on the screen, but they're
turning only around  one axis, not to forget the acompanied  scroller  and chess
board scroll! ñVery nice for GFA basic!
Again a picture  of a Joker is following, painted  by óSTSurvivorð again, followed
by a RGB plasma.
The screen turns purple  again and ñ9 masked  dotsspheresð  with overall ñ36oo dots
coming up. It's the last effect of this mainpart and looks like this...

{*i bif2.pi1 m 0 20 0 200}

At last there is a  vertical scroller with  several informations about the demo,
a nice òNLCð logo drawn by óFlanð of òExað and a chip music by óLapð of òNextð.
Overall I  would say  that this screen  is real  nice for GFA basic and could be
the best GFA screen ever if the design would be more  continuous. Therefore some
good effects  are shown  and a lot of  cool pictures by  óSTSurvivorð are included
and I can't remember another multipart screen in a megademo  which is fullfilled
with so many pictures!

ó5. INFO SCREEN

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñ       - Thyrex / Loud!
ñmsx    - Mad Max / TEX

This small screen is also called ñ"MEET YOUR STARS IN THE BAR"ð and starts  with a
big  advert for ñ"THE TRACE"ð, the game of  óSTSURVIVORð and óPTIFð of òTYPHOONð. It's a
nice big logo, drawn by... no comment =)
At next the screen  is splitted  in two parts. On the upper part you can see the
wellknown ñvertical rastersð in several curves.
Below you can see a starfield with  a textdisplayer, telling you some info about
the screen and òLoud!ð.
A very ñoldfashionedð screen... the late eighties and early nineties came back!

ó6. GREETINGS SCREEN

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñmsx    - Big Alec / Delta Force

At first  there  is again a  nice drawn  picture displayed, acompanied  with the
message: óNo road seems to long with a friend!ð... cool!
Then a ñ"Back In France"ð logo  is displayed  on the background  and  another nice
effect comes  up: meanwhile the greetings are  displayed  some bubbles coming up
and  moving  over the screen to the  upper border! Remembers  a bit to  the last
screen of òAURAð's ñ"Mathematica"ð dentro from 1992.
Anyway nice to look at!

ó7. BONUS SCREEN

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñmsx    - Lotus / Hotline

It's a small  screen, with  a òLOUD!ð logo in  the background and a  nice digidrum
music  again. The usual  textdisplayer brings  you the  complete history  of the
demo, a real strange story.
The screen isn't very special... nice colours but nothing more...

ó8. HIDDEN SCREEN

ñcoding - Thyrex / Loud!
ñgfx    - STSurvivor / Loud!
ñmsx    - Mad Max / TEX

You will find this screen  on the desktop. At first  a big rasterscroller  comes
up but it's only  fake. It looks ñreal cruelð and so you're more  impressed as the
real screen  comes up, displaying a fat  guy on the left  side with a big moving
and distorting background in overscan, acompanied with a little scroller...
Again a very ñoldstyledð screen... but nice too.

Ok, that's it!

òConclusionð: Not bad for the work of just two guys. There are  several  nice efx,
            never seen before in GFA basic. Unfortunately there are no  original
            musix, but therefore a big load of óNEWð and óCOOLð grafix  by the  most
            promising grafician  from France  on ST, óSTSurvivorð! This  guy has a
            very big  potential which you  can see on  this demo... Some  of the
            screens and parts are nice designed too and so I'm inclined  to call
            it the ñbest GFA (only) megademo  so farð. If you're a  demolover just
            get it! It  isn't a thing  to impress  the next  PC-Lamer but a sign
            that  there are  still some actions on  ST and perhaps  other people
            will finish their demos too, after they saw this production?!
