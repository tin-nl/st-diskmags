          óTeardropð - òMystic Bytesð 1998 [QuaST party release] ñ(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------          

What does  a polish programmer  do if he  wins a 14 MB memory  expansion for his
Falcon? Of course  he writes  14 MB demos. óTeardropð may  cause some  problems if
less than ñ14 MBð are found, so I made sure that I boot a clean  machine and dived
into òMystic Bytesò latest adventure: óTeardropð.

The demo  starts with an ASCII-Logo by òsK!ð, depacks and  precalculates some data
and either crashes now or starts the demo.
Luckily it started  without any problems on my machine. The first effect is some
ñzooming lettersð (or at least  something that looks like  letters), followed by a
ñMystic bytes logoð, this  time not  as  nice as  in òtime outð, then the  screen is
"shaken" off and displays a ñzoomingð óteardropð logo in front of a ñtextured tunnelð.
The border of the screen flashes according to the music, this time by òDr.Maxð ...

Hmmm... Haven't we seen that in time out before in some way? The screen with the
textured tunnel is then zoomed out while another screen is simultanesously being
zoomed  in. It's a  weird looking 2D ñplasmað with  some ñmoving lightflaresð on it,
and it's pretty fast, too.

This doesn't hold on very long and is  being replaced  by a ñtextured tunnelð with
ñlightflares moving, melting, dissappearing and popping upð again. When the flares
appear or melt, the  tunnel, which is also  being moved  a little, slows  down a
lot, which of course makes the effect look a little less good.

Again  we  switch back  to a  kind of ñ2D Plasma with lightflaresð popping  up and
moving. There  are 3 "centres" in  the plasma  and their  surrounding  plasma is
being  interpolated  between the centres, so it's  really hard  to call  it a 2D
plasma, as the  centres also  move. Colours are being switched from time to time
from a dark green/blue to a medium brown/gold.

Finally, a òMystic  logoð appears  which  is  illuminated  by  a  ñbumpmapperð. What
happens  then could be  described as  a ñ"blowing  up" effectð. It looks  like the
òMystic Bytesð logo  was  printed  on a balloon  which is  then  inflated - motion
blurred. Excellently  synchronised with the  music, like  the most of  the other
effects.

The logo  drops and you  await that someone  opens a door  for you to  leave the
cinema, but the demo isn't quite finished yet. The music starts to live up again
and  the ñwinning graphicð from òmOdð, Jasmin, is  being scrolled  on the screen. It
moves out again after a few seconds, leaving the screen black and blank.

Not very  long however, as  a blue òMystic Bytesð logo  ñzooms and rotatesð from the
viewer  into the background, again  its ñmotion being blurredð, again  excellently
synchronised with the music.

Time for  another tunnel. This time, it is a ñtextured tunnel with lightflaresð on
the wall which  seem to be moving  around the inner rim of the tunnel  and are a
bit motion-blurred, too. 
The last effect consists of ñmany textured cubesð which  look like  wooden blocks.
The viewer  is moved around and between the blocks  for a while until  the music
and the demo finally ends.

Again, the òMystic Bytesð team  released an  impressive demo, underlining the fact
that first-class Falcon demos do not belong to western europe only  anymore. The
most positive  aspects about óteardropð are the  excellent synchronisation between
the music  and the effects, the variablity and the  flexibility of  the effects.
There is  an awful lot of effects in óteardropð, and they are all new in some way.

The negative  aspects of óteardropð are that  most effects look  quite ugly. No, I
don't mean  that they flicker  or aren't being well  presented, but the textures
being used in the tunnels, the 2D plasma, they are all dark, do not feature many
colours and aren't  designed very nice  either. Comparing them with the textures
being used  in -time out-, where  everything was  light, colour- and  beautiful,
this is a step backwards in my eyes.

The rest  of the graphics - besides òmOd'sð picture - are not too  hot in my eyes.
The óteardropð logo is  simple and plain white (more or less) and the òMysticð òBytesð
logo is the same as used in ñMaggie 25ð intro, rather simple.

I think the positive  aspects outweigh the negative aspects though  in any case.
òSqwardð has shown that he is a damn good programmer and the music is pretty good,
too. Graphics may not be the strong point of the demo, but the  graphics are not
very important in this demo either.
A bit  more  design, and óteardropð would  have been  mentioned  along  with òDreamð
òDimensionð  or  probably  even  òSonolumineszenzð,  as  it  is  a  very  good  demo
considering the technical aspects. Looking  like  that, óteardropð remains to be a
very good demo, but not a perfect demo.
