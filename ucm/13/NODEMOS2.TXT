                                 ò-PART TWO!-ð


I wasn't very  surprised to get  NO response on my article in  the last issue of
UCM about never released demos. Who the hell remembers them anyway? Only Moondog
gave  me some  names which  came back  to my mind  when we  spoke  on  the phone
sometime... Due to his help some more names came back to my mind and we can take
a look on what's deteriorate on some people's harddrives...



óo RESPECTABLES - MEGADEMO (ST)ð

  It was announced in 1993 and in every Interview (including an old one featured
  in a previous  issue of UCM) TYREM of the Respectables is telling that it will
  soon come  out... Some guys have seen previews but never  spreaded them... The
  biggest  shit I can remember about them is that they fooled  Defjam/Checkpoint
  at the  InterCon'96 by telling him that they will send him the  Source-Code so
  that  he can  finish  it... and  behind his  back they made  bad jokes  in the
  realtime  article... In my opinion the RESPECTLESS ...eh... Respectables  were
  the greatest  HYPE in our demoscene-history! They only have released about 2-3
  Guestscreens for  Megademos... but NOTHING  mindblowing! They only got a  name
  because they stood in the shadow of the Lost Boys...



ño INTER - INTERVIEW (FALCON)ð

  The attentive readers of UCM have surely noticed that all the sources for this
  project have  been handed  over the EarX/Fun! Several  effects can be  seen in
  their  new demo  called FUNGLE BEATS. The  INTERVIEW demo  will never  see the
  light in the form that it was planned once...



òo EFFECT - SEDUCTION (ST) (3 DISKS)ð

  This was a  big project started by  TRONIC of Effect back  in 1995 or so... He
  claimed it would come on 3 disks and will feature guestscreens from all active
  crews  on ST  at that  time: Effect, The Blues Boys, STAX, .tSCc., The Naughty
  Bytes, Energetic and lotsa more... But what the hell has he done for the demo?
  I haven't recognized any progress... Did he thought all the guys just send him
  the screens and he just has to put them together or what?



óo INNER CIRCLE - THE GENETIX DEMO (ST) (2 DISKS)ð

  Not much known... It was  announced in the endpart  of their  wellknown THINGS
  NOT TO DO demo. It should come on 2 disks...



ño TNB - WHEN HIFIDREAMS BECOME REALITY 2 (ST)ð
      ñ- LASSE REINB™NG (ST)ð

  It would be  a neverending story  if I would talk about all the never released
  projects of this  group but as far as I know all the modules and  graphics for
  WHEN..2 are finished. Only the code is the problem... and with LASSE REINB”NG,
  the 'winner' from  the Siliconvention'97 it's the same... The released version
  of this ST-dentro runs only on Falcon. What a heck...
  Hey Drizzt: "Beweg' endlich Deinen Arsch und mach das Demo fertig!
  SCHADE DAS BETON NICHT BRENNT!"

(note by moondog... and these were  just the latest projects... before  this the
                    band was working on 2 or 3 other demo projects too which all
                    reached some  kind of higher  state (running previews), such
                    as an un-named ST dentro back in 1994 (just shown at the DCC
                    2 PARTY in Dresden 1994), a second dentro (mOd did  a lot of
                    grafix for  it...) for ST, I think 1994  too... and last but
                    not least an un-named Falcon dentro, thought  for release on
                    the Symposium'96... I think I have still the previews on the
                    harddisk of my damaged Falcon... have I ever  mentioned that
                    I was also involved in about 3 game projects of this band?
                    And that was just the stuff -I- was working on together with
                    Drizzt and Apache... but it was all just wasted time... Hey!
                    "Waste" was the working-title of another dentro and parts of
                    it were released in "Lasse Reinb”ng"... strange, eh?!



òo ANIMAL MINE - DREAMS 2 (ST)ð
              ò- INFINITY MUSICDISK (ST)ð

  The same goes  for this group... thousands  of projects were  started but they
  were never  finished! DREAMS 2... hm... this  is just a  rumour that  somebody
  told to me. I never  heard myself about it...



óo STAX - FANTASIA (ST)ð

  Hm, I can't remember If I am allowed to speak about this one... Naahh, it does
  not matter  anyway. As far as I know it was the sequel to  the REVOLUTION demo
  by STAX. All the screens are finished but no one wants to put it together to a
  bootdisk... lazyness again... :-)



ño HEMOROIDS - PHOTOTRO (ST)ð

  This  demo  was  promised  some  years ago  and I  think  it has  also  won  a
  competition  at some french party back  in 1992/3/4. They claimed till the end
  that it  surely will be released but nothing happened... and now the HEMOROIDS
  are dead. (note: there are new rumours about a release around...)



I hope I haven't  depressed you all out  there by this negative  report. My only
hint against  depression  is: Be happy, stay  active... AND MAKE MORE 'FINISHED'
DEMOS!

outta'ere.
