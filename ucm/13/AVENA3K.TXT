ñAVENAð were always different.

ñAVENAð are not just like the rest.

ñAVENAð are trendsetters.


This are three  opinions about ñAVENAð I heard over the last month. With their new
production simply called ó3 Kð we can set this under prove...

I guess that  nobody needs to be informed about ñAVENAð. But maybe there are still
some  people out  there not  knowing who they are, so I am  trying to give you a
short overview of their work and their history.

Back in  late 1993, ñAVENAð grew  up from  the ashes  of a  German  ST-crew called
ñWHITE STATUSð, who released the óWEIGHTLESS REMNENTð CeBIT demo and had appearances
in several demos, such as the óGRUMBLER IN A RUTTING SEASONð by ñELECTRICITYð.

In former times, ñAVENAð had up to 6 members, such as the famous musician ñTOMMYð.
But this dude left the scene for a more or less known tomato-ketchup product...

The 6 German  guys from Hamburg ("Hamburgers") worked very hard on new demos and
they released  quite a lot. Just to mention a few: óDEMENTIAð, óWELTSCHMERZð and the
unforgetable óENRAGEDð. Somewhen  in  1995, ñTATð of ñDIGITAL CHAOSð, who  already co-
operated  with them for the óENRAGEDð production, joined the band and brought some
fresh  air into the  group. Whilst the  rest of  the band fell asleep on Falcon,
bought PCs  or did whatever they wrote in their funny readme  files (climbing up
trees  shouting; dare  to... well, as  they  said:  shit), ñTATð became  the  most
outstanding coder of the atARi scene.

At  SiliConvention '97  party  in  Bremen  he  released  the  still  not  beaten
óSONOLUMINESZENZð  demo,  a  great  piece  of  excessive  DSP  3D-codes, fantastic
graphics and smooth design.

ò(cut: So Leon do you see any rivality with the German "T-spy"? ;)ð

After that it got quite quiet around ñTATð, everyone was waiting for him releasing
a new  demo, but  he only  released  intros for óMAGGIEð from time  to time  and
sometimes people thought he finally gave up.

But how  wrong  we  were! In  summer 1998 he  came  back  with  massive  forces,
announcing the fabulous ñBINLINERð demo and released this litte screen.


...there were  96k intros, there were 4k screens and there  are even  those very
small 128 bytros. But up to now, nobody dared to code in another category:


                               ò3k screens!ð

ñTATð must have seen that, so he released the thing I am just reviewing...

Ergo: ñAVENAð are not just like the rest. They are different.


ó3 Kð was released  in July 1998 and it has a size of  3108 bytes. The readme file
attached  to the program tells the interested reader that this little screen was
already  finished a long time before ñDHSð or ñLlama/.tSCc.ð released their stunning
4k intros. ñTATð just  released ó3 Kð because he found this one in the  dark corners
of his harddisk and to show people he is still there.

If I  would have  enough  space to  write  about I'd really  like to  discuss if
harddisks can have corners. I don't think so, but who cares?!

It's  really  great to  see  that the  readme  file is  only 1k in size - a very
rare state for British chatterbox-productions. ;)

ñTATð's latest  production runs under VGA and RGB both  and - indicating  his fine
art of  code - it sets  the  needed  resolution by  itself. Really  good, if you
remember  some  Polish  people  still  not  doing  this  even  in  their  bigger
productions.


After starting ó3 Kð, the  screen is set to black and there a  fucking lot of flat
fishes  shown. The  fishes  are vectors, using - as  far  I can  see  it - phong
shading  and turning  around on the screen. Our little water-loving  friends are
colored in red, which is not too stylish.

But at least  we could think  of ñAVENAð making some kind of "Save the Nature"-demo:
those fishes are  contaminated with Kryptonite! So ó3 Kð is a very critical demo
as well! Great!

This impression  is reinforced by looking at the background color which supposes
to be water: it's black! So these are krytonite fishes swimming in a huge sea of
bad Arab oil!

Gosh, I knew ñAVENAð would kick ass!


(Anyone got  the point? The reviewer  would really like some blue background and
fish-colored fishes. Hehe.)


The whole screen  runs under  a resolution of 32ox24o pixels. Only bad  thing is
that you cannot  quit ó3 Kð to the desktop, so  it does not really  fullfill its
sense as a screensaver just as ñTATð proclaimed it...


Eventually ó3 Kð is a nice done 3k screen which  shows óTATð's coding  skills. As he
already promised more 4k intros in the readme file, we can be looking forward to
other screens by him!
