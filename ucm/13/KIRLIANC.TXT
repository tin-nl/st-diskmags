Ú                     KIRLIAN CAMERA - "THE ICE CURTAIN"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

released by Solar Plexus / Nova Tekk 1998

Ok... before I will write something more to this great album some words to a man
living on a big island... I hope you enjoy  this review, because  it's NO german
act and 2nd it's no industrial act! Ha! But I think you wouldn't enjoy it anyway
because it's an electronic wave project...

For all the interested readers: Ò"The Ice Curtain" is the first official Best Of-
album by ÚKIRLIAN CAMERA, one of the  oldest bands in  the electronic wave sector
at all! This band is active since  198o and released a horrible bunch of albums,
singles and split ep's in this time.

They started in the same time as Depeche Mode and some of their early  songs are
very similar to old DeMo songs, the same electronics and melodies, just the fact
that ÚKIRLIAN CAMERA used female voices makes the difference sometimes.
With the time the whole sound was darker and darker and meanwhile DeMo were more
and more in the spotlight  of the whole  teenie-generation in the  late eighties
K.C. drifted  more and more  in the independent corner, with very sad  songs and
also sometimes very strange electronic arrangements.

And they  never left this  corner again. Therefore they  reached a state of cult
with the time and their rare shows and concerts are a mess! I saw them last year
on the Autumn Nights Festival on an old castle. It was a real uneasy atmosphere,
to see the singers standing on the stage with masks, surrounded  by fog and dark
light effects, with  video animations in the  background, showing death, war and
marching soldiers.
At this point I have to mention that their sound is similar to ÚDEATH IN JUNE and
ÚCURRENT 93, and this both bands playing around with fascistic symbols and belong
to the brown corner. Also on the festival, together with bands like ÚSOL INVICTUS
from  England (the singer  was a  former member  of ÚDEATH IN JUNE), the  italian
ÚCAMERATA MEDIOLANENSE and the ritual project ÚMOTHER DESTRUCTION, you could think
sometimes  to be on the false event, because  those bands holding up  contact to
the mentioned projects above (if I'm right).
But K.C. performing just the same sound, their lyrics are of  another kind, even
if some songs like Ò"Heldenplatz" sounding as they contain militaristic stuff...
The band  sings mainly about personal  problems, sadness, lost love, pain and so
on... all in one the most of their  songs presenting the state of the members of
the  band, their  own experiences. But  they don't  want to  be put  in the same
corner as all  the depressive goth bands and don't like all  the stuff from this
kind... esp. the so called feelings of the goth scene...
But hey, enough of this kind! I will go over to the review now...
Ò"The Ice Curtain" comes on 2 CDs  with 27 songs in  over 15o minutes  music from
the world of ÚKIRLIAN CAMERA! What a mess!
Meanwhile the first CD presents their work of the nineties the second brings the
eighties and  this is a good feature because their  early works are  released on
vinyl only!

Ok, I will write down  something to my  private favourites  only... The others I
will mention only very short. I can't say much to the lyrics  itself because the
italian touch makes it hard to understand the lyrics  at all. But it sounds very
interesting! But they don't print  their lyrics, maybe they're to private and so
you must  occupy yourself  with the songs and get impressed  by the whole  thing
together...

The Desert Inside ... was taken from an EP which was released in 1997. This song
  is a  very rhytmic  one, living  of the hard  beats accompanied with  the dark
  voice of Angelo Bergamini, the founder of the band. Within the  over 8 minutes
  of playing time this song paints a very threatening  atmosphere. As he said in
  an interview he wrote this song in a state of trance, as he felt burned out...
Solaris IV/A ... is a bit older, from 1995. This song comes along with very hard
  digestible electronic sounds. All is  beeping and  there are some  synthesizer
  fields coming up  later... The voice of the  singer sounds  strange, he speaks
  more  as he sings. All  in one this song leaves  the impression that  there is
  someone waiting on his end and begging for it.
The Icy Dawn ... is from 1997 again, taken from the Ò"Desert Inside" EP again but
  in comparison with the maintrack it's completely different. The female  voices
  dominating  the whole song  and it's  a very slow one with massive synthesizer
  stuff and many  electronic sounds... later more and more  synthy-fields taking
  over the whole situation... I like the last parts of the song, just close your
  eyes and listen to this parts... they're great!
Eclipse V4 ... it's a remake of their biggest hit, composed  back in  1988. This
  song is  maybe the  song who reached the whole  public and not only  the black
  scene! It's a club hit, without any question! It's very danceable, melodic and
  even if the remake is a lot darker as the original it's a good one!
Erinnerung ... this is based on  a poem of August Stramm and a remake of the old
  version, appearing at first  on the Ò"Erinnerung" MCD back in  1994. This  is a
  very strange one... ever heard italians, trying to make german speech singing?
  The whole arrengement is strange too, at first  some hard rhythms  comming out
  of the speakers, than you can hear Emilia's voice in the background untill the
  distorted voice Angelo is  speaking and than  screaming... horrrr... the whole
  atmosphere is going  harder and darker with every minute and  there are nearly
  7 minutes to go! This song is surely nothing for people of melodic songs...
In The Endless Rain ... this track  was recorded  during a  soundcheck  on their
  Ò"Pictures 1997 Tour" in  Germany. It lives from  the voice of  Barbara Bofelli
  and  the slow  beats and  massive synthy fields in  the background. It doesn't
  bring a so dark feeling but hells up the whole situation a bit...
I Am The Light ... this song isn't one of my faves... the voices  are to strange
  stretched, it sounds totally overcontrolled (Åbersteuert?!)...
Ascension ... Raaaah! A great track! Totally  different  in comparison  with all
  the songs so far! The great use of synthesizers and the voice  of Emilia bring
  a touch of eternity to your  ears! Just great! Esp. the  endpart is  very cool
  again, lean  back and  dream! Unfortunately I  don't know  the right  word, in
  german I would say "erhaben"...
Sea Of Memory ... an acoustic song?! Just with acoustic guitar, very rare synth-
  stuff and the  voice of Emilia again. Nice but not  as impressive  as the most
  other songs.
Fields Of Sunset ... again an acoustic song, a bit faster than the first one and
  with Angelo's  stretched vocals this time... Hum. But this  song has its  good
  passages too, esp. when the slow parts changing to the fast ones!
Twilight Fields ... just  a break, with  massive synth-stuff  and female  voices
  again, definitly too short with just 1 and a half minute!
Drifting ... their latest song, from the Ò"Drifting" MCD released this year. This
  song comes again with massive beats (sometimes nearly technoing) and also with
  treatening passages again. But it lives from Barbara's background voice with a
  small oriental touch... they're standing in total contrast to  Angelo's voice,
  which is  distorted again. A great song and with  over 7 minutes very  good to
  lean back and chill...
Heldenplatz ... Emilia is  singing of a  lost fight  for a  love (therefore  the
  title), their voice  is surrounded by complex  synthesizer arrangements again.
  It's a very slow song, but  without giving a  depressive state or  so, more to
  lean back and think about the things going on.
Memories Are made Of This ... blaaa! A piano chanson! No way!
Blue Room ... Ok... we're going to the eighties! This song is a typical new wave
  song of this time. The female vocals  coming from one  of their  former singer
  Simona. Nothing more to  say, it's a good song, matching to the line-up of all
  the many 80ies parties.
Eclipse ... THE ORIGINAL!!! Sounds  very  different, even  if the  intro is much
  more treatening as in the new version the song itself is more  a pop song. The
  voice of Bianca (also a  former singer) matches for me much more  to the whole
  atmosphere of  the song. Besides the  synth-fields there  is also an  electric
  guitar included. All  in all, it's a good danceable song and I like it more as
  the new version.
Nightship 451 ... it's  a more  rhytmic  song, with speech  singing  by  Charlie
  Mallozzi (also a former member?!) but the song is a bit too monotone...
Lontano ... nothing more than a short instrumental
Austria ... 10 minutes mainly instrumental  electronic sound with  some passages
  sang by Angelo. A bit boring with the time.
Tor Zwei ... again a more instrumental  song and again  over 10 minutes (hell!).
  This song is again one of the more treatening ones, with many  synth-stuff but
  without highs or big breaks and so it's with the time a bit boring.
Celephais ... again a short instrumental break
News ... the oldest song on  this compilation, from 1980! And you hear this with
  the first beats! Strange! The singing sounds very  cruel because of  the heavy
  italian touch of the Simona... Remembers very to  the early works  of DeMo and
  other bands who started this time, just like early Krupps works and so on!
Rays ... Hey... Angelo is singing to this  typical new wave pop  song! And guess
  what! Again it seems inspired  by DeMo! It's more digestible as "News" but for
  me still a bit too strange.
Still Close ... hrrr... again those strange  synthies. Sounds not so  good in my
  ears. Sorry!
Memories Of A House ... At first I thought: Hey! For 1981 there is cool synthie-
  stuff included! But then I looked into the booklet and saw the  year 1989 were
  it was remixed. But the song is also a bit too strange and too slow too!
Edges ... A cool popsong! A typical 80ies wave song! Great  stuff! Melodic, fast
  nice breaks, cool voice, electric guitars, piano parts! Just great!
Ocean ... Erm... this sounds more like some  Bangles stuff... a bit too much pop
  this time, in comparison with their new works they have must  taken some drugs
  to write such a bonbon-colourful popsong! Huuh... not bad really, but not real
  good either!

Ok... I have to come to an end I think. Without any doubt Ò"The Ice Curtain" is a
very good  compiled best-of. Besides their greatest hits  on the first CD you'll
get a lot of old songs too you surely never find in a  normal record shop on the
original single or vinyl  album anymore. For  the ones who  like more  the 90ies
stuff it's still the possibility to explore the "old" style of ÚKIRLIAN CAMERA.
All in  one this album is also a good thing for starters in the electronic wave-
scene, no question! And it's  maybe thought for the ones who can't buy all their
numerous records too and won't buy them because they don't like all the songs on
them... But those  reasons doesn't  matter to me, I  think Ò"The Ice Curtain" was
the most impressive release (maybe except the coming Depeche Mode Singles Colly)
in the year 1998! So go ahead and buy it!
-update- They have re-released their old legendary  album Ò"Todesengel - The Fall
ÒOf Life" as limited  picture disc with new versions of some songs (Ò"U-Bahn v2" &
Ò"In The Endless Rain") and an unreleased track so far too.
