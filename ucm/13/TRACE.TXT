Finally it reached the public, ñ"ZE TRACE"ð or better, another óTron cloneð.
Besides ñ"MR BOOMER"ð it was one of the most promising projects of  the new rising
french ST scene  and to say  it right at  the beginning, it  hasn't disturbed my
hope, at least not very...

But who is responsible for  this point?! Of course óST SURVIVORð of òLOUD!ð, who did
a lot of  nice grafix which  gave the game a bonus point in the  presentation in
comparison with so much other ST productions and a general kick at all.
At second I was  surprised by  the numerous new (but short =( ...) chipsounds by
ó5o5ð of òCHECKPOINTð who did a great job because it forces the originality  and you
can believe me if I say that his name stands for itself  and belongs without any
doubt to the top 5 of ALL chip musicians on ST so far!
Furthermore  the coder óTELSUDð of òTYPHOONð who  tried to use some special features
as raster splits and lower border too.
The second involved coder, óPTIFð of òTYPHOONð, who did the nice little presentation
intro...
Last but not least  the idea to blow up the game concept itself  makes this game
more interesting.

Ok... I will start with the review.

ñ"THE TRACE"ð is as  said above a Tron clone... this time  up to three players are
allowed (too bad that you can't play the game alone).
"hmmm what more" do you might say... a lot more! Not even that you're 'tronning'
around like in the old game, there are a  lot of features  included. So there is
it possible to shit on the floor to stop and kill your enemies, to  shot, to use
speed ups. Therefor  you have  a shop (known from all the shot'em'up  games from
the old times) in the game where you can buy all this stuff.

After a small intro you're confronted with the mainmenu where you can chose some
soundoption, define the keys for the control and get some information too.
The game is played with six keys for every player, 4 for the  direction, one for
shot a bullet or use another extra and one to swap between the extras.
After going to start you're watching at the ò"shop"ð where you can buy some extras
or weapons for the  following level. So you can buy bullets (to kill the enemies
or destroy obstacles), shit (if the enemies will  crash into your  pile the will
die ofcourse... it's a Tron game, do you remember?!), speed ups and so on.

When at least two players have chosen their stuff and want to exit from the shop
the game starts. At first there is the  whole level displayed and a  small clock
is falling down, counting back to zero and the thing starts when zero is reached
(just some seconds, but needed for the orientation in the level).
After this  you can move  around in this level, ofcourse you  have to  avoid any
contact with the  lines of your enemy or  obstacles and  walls. Furthermore it's
your job too to guide  your enemies in a situtation where  they can't escape and
must crash and die.
In the levels  there are some coins laying around (good for the  next session in
the shop) and some bonus items as well. Ofcourse it's a run on them and the best
will profit of collecting them.
The first  levels are  styled  in special forms, you have  òBATHROOMð  with moving
rubber ducks, soap bubbles and so on. There is also a òSPACEð level with stars and
lost  astronauts, furthermore  a  òGRAVEYARDð with  skulls, tombstones  and so on,
later there is an òCOMPUTERð level too, with joysticks, keyboards and STs (ofcoz).
The  very late  levels (overall  there are  2o levels to  play) containing  more
ripped grafix from old ST games and some announcements for ñTOXIC MAGð and paroles
like ò"ST IS STILL ALIVE"ð etc. (ofcourse he is as this game shows).

After all levels are  finished there is an  overall view of all  points and last
but not least a hiscore where you can write your name for eternity or  up to the
date when a better player comes up.

In the lower border the points are displayed and the still available weapons and
so on. After  just one player is left on the screen there you can  also see your
score there.

The presentation  of the game is  very nice and reminds me  to some professional
games, intro  and menu screens are good styled for a freeware game. All together
it leaves a very straight  designed impression. The points in the  game menu are
easy to understand and use.

Furthermore the grafix are a  good point of this  game. Sure, óST SURVIVORð made a
lot of better ones but the logos and fonts are very stylish, the player selector
is nice  too (using more than 16 colours), the objects in the  game and  all the
small sprites are a bit simple but doing their job very well.
All in one the whole design is very appealing (not again and again those blaerg,
eh, black backgrounds  and childish colours) and done straight trough  the whole
game.

A weak point is  the control! Ok... not in the way you may think, the problem is
that all three players have to use ONE keyboard and this isn't  good... Not only
that it's hard to sit with two other guys in front of one keyboard, no, there it
is possible to bother the otherone while playing.
I think the implementation  of joysticks and JagPad control (on STE  and Falcon)
would be a better choice.

The most  impressive part  are the numerous chipsounds by 5o5 which  really kick
ass! He composed  a lot of them  in various styles  and some of  them are really
strange, just like a technoing tune, other sound like a synthesis of Mad Max and
Scavenger sounds, others are in a very own style, funny, crazy, just cool!
I think it's the first game  since ñ"CRAPMAN"ð by òSYNERGYð where so many  exclusive
composed musics were included! I nearly  would say, even if you don't like Tron-
games, get it just because of the music! For the first original levels there are
different tunes included for everyone, as well as in menu and intro too.

But hey, not to forget the sampled  sound on machines with  more than 512 KB and
STE ofcourse. On the  last one you're able to listen  to 5o5's music  and the fx
together. On a simple ST this option bombs the game away because there is no DMA
chip included. At  this point I  would like to see a routine  who recognizes the
machine and disables this options in the menu.

Except some bugs the game is done very well and this  saves the motivation for a
while when you've found some friends  to play with. The  levels are numerous and
the first ones are designed very well and  different. You have a  SPACE level, a
GRAVEYARD  level, a BATHROOM  level and  more. They contain  moving  sprites and
obstacles too, as well as bonus items.
The level design  changes from time to time when you load them, the  objects are
laying on other places and you need everytime some seconds to orientate yourself
on the  playarea and  for this you have some time and  you'll need it  hardly to
avoid it to crash into the next obstacle or enemy.

òConclusionð: ñ"THE TRACE"ð is a ónice gameð without any questions. The design is nice
            with some good (and some less good...) pixeled grafix. One big bonus
            point are the nice and  original chipsounds  by ó5o5ð. Other  technics
            bettering up the situation because some STE specials and tricks were
            used (lower border and rasters) too.
            The idea to include some ómore featuresð in the gameplay helps to make
            this game all other than boring (if you find someone to play against
            ofcourse).
            This version  suffers a bit under  the problems with the control and
            some nasty bugs too but I think with enough feedback the guys behind
            the game will get the motivation to enhance the whole thing a bit!
            Btw... my ratings are thought for a ó1o4o STeð and two friends in your
            room. On halfmeg machines  and STF, and last  but not  least without
            friends the  overall score would make a more or less big  jump under
            this score.
