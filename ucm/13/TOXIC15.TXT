ò________________________________________________________________________________

ñTOXIC MAGð is one of the longest going mags besides ñMAGGIEð in the Atari scene. It
exists since 1991 and changed  many times the publishers and  so names  like òTHE
òSTORM BROTHERSð, òI.C.S.ð and  others were  the labels for  this mag  over  all the
years.
Finally it  was taken  over by the guys of òTYPHOONð and òNO LIMIT CODINGð aka òLOUD!
and they're still here to entertain mainly the  french Atarians  with their very
unregular released magazines.

Mainly the french Atarians? Yep... still it is this problem, the language. ñTOXIC
is still written  mainly (or should I say, the whole mag?!) in french  and I can
remember to the time were it  was written in english and thought as rival mag of
the ñMAGGIEð, yep, ñTHE MAGGIEð... It had even the same shell!
But this times are over. I don't know right when they  had changed the language,
I even don't know if the magazine  was published all the  time, I only know that
it came back into the spotlight about 1994/1995, fully written in  french...erm.
But because I have a very small  knowledge of this language I'm always going and
try to read what's  written there. And this is very easy in  comparison with the
czech and polish diskmags... Czsygzchs e Zczadget  eh?! =)   just joking...

ñTOXIC MAGð cames  along this time with an intro by òSECTOR ONEð, and if  I remember
right it's the first òSECTOR ONEð demo-look-a-like thingie for years now and after
the shit quality of their intro  for ñTOXIC MAG 12ð I was a bit  surprised of this
new thing. The whole  thing is  coded by óEXYLð, with  several nice grafix  by EDO
and an old stylish module by óDMA SCð, not bad. But the intro  doesn't feature any
effects, it's just nice looking because of the grafix and "design"...

Ok... The magazine itself comes on two disx again, one with the magazine and the
second filled with some stuffs. So you can find some releases  from the óINTERJAM
ó1998 Partyð in it, just like the 4K intros, ñ"REANIMATION"ð by óSYNTAXð and the intro
by the òTOS CREWð. ñ"SOUNDMACHINE v3.2"ð by óTHE BEASTð of òTYPHOONð is included too...
and btw... check our review of this sound player:
>--> SOUNDMACHINE v3.3(!) <--<                                                      {*\SOUNDM.TXT}
There is also  a demo version  of the  game ñ"THE TRACE"ð by òLOUD!ð and  òTYPHOONð on
the disk  and finally there  is a folder containing ñ"PLAYSID v2.o1"ð by òCREAMð and
some other small things. Our review of ñ"THE TRACE"ð (the latest version) you will
find in this magazine too:
>--> THE TRACE <--<                                                                 {*\TRACE.TXT}
It seems as ñTOXIC MAGAZINEð is  the last magazine on the Atari who still holds on
the tradition to release  every issue accompanied with tons of new stuff. A nice
feature... my respects.

But it's time to check out the magazine itself.
The shell  and  viewer are presented in  medres and  both running on  Falcon too
without  problems. On Falcon  you have the possibility to replay  modules in the
background but they  don't pack modules to the mag. There are  also no chipmusix
on ST included  and so I'm wondering if it's really the  latest style to present
the ST versions  of the magazines  without any  music. It's  boring! Even if the
menu would  be coded in GFA only (and because óTHYREXð coded it  I think so) there
are possibilities to better up the situation  with some sounds... there are tons
of sources for the craziest  players around... but maybe there is no interest in
including this stuff...
You can control the menu with mouse or  keyboard and there  are several features
included, so you  can still activate accessories, change the  palette, print and
so on. For me ñTOXIC MAGð has one  of the best shells, even if they don't have any
scroll routines implemented.

Issue 15 of ñTOXIC MAGð contains about 6o articles of several topics. You have the
usual scene part, with the latest news (esp. from France) from the scene and the
whole world of Atari.
You can find some party reports too, just like óST SURVIVORðs view on the óINTERJAM
ó1998ð and a  report of another small french party, the  óKEYBOARD PARTYð (?!). This
is a bit more interesting because no  one outside of France seems to know what's
going on in the french Party scene. Ok, it seems  that all those  little parties
have more a very local  character but again and again a few french Atari sceners
can be found  there. This party was held in the first  days of May, but it seems
as there were no special releases for the Atari...

Another nice (and english!) article  was written by óEROSð of òCOBRAð, reviewing the
polish 8bit/16bit/32bit scene and the history of the band òCOBRAð. Ok, it's really
the history  because the  band seems to be history =). Anyway, because this very
interesting article  was published  in ñTOXIC MAGð only you have to get  it if you
want to know more about the things going on in Poland.

You can read something about the latest diskmag  releases and  so there  are the
reviews of ñMAGGIE # 25ð, ñFALKMAG # 9ð (is it still alive?!), a new  french and ST-
oriented  HTML magazine  called  ñSTIMULUSð, ñSTRATOSð, ñUNDERCOVER # 11ð and  several
paper magazines and fanzines, not all of them are Atari oriented!
There is a big scene report included but a lot of the informations given in this
report aren't right anymore. Anyway they're used to feed the hype... =)

Another more  interesting article are the óCENTEKð news  by óWHITE NINJAð of the old
french band òADRENALINEð  who's working for óCENTEK ðtoo. So there are  informations
about the  latest softwares from the óCENTEKð label, info about  óCENTURBO 2ð and so
on. Again for  us, not  connected to  the  french  Atari scene  in general  very
interesting to read what's happening there.

At next there are reviews of demos (nothing special, just the  latest releases),
public  domain  stuff, Nintendo 64 games, Megadrive games, movies, a list of the
latest versions of different tools and utilities, the  complete solution  of the
old RPG ñ"ISHAR"ð by Silmarils. Furthermore there are articles about the óMILAN o4o
and TOS 6. Besides a lot serious and not so serious (ehem) things there are also
some interviews included, besides the post mortem ones, released in ñUCM # 11ð too
(because  they were  done for ñUCMð and ñTOXICð) you can  find interviews  of ó5o5ð of
òCHECKPOINTð and óMC LASERð of ò.tSCc.ð there.
Last but not least there  are lyrics of  several metal bands  included. (ok, the
band ARCANA isn't a metal band, but who cares anyway?)
Several textes are very hard to understand because it isn't easy to  find out of
which topic they are sometimes. Anyway, there are  some nice informations  given
and to  complete your knowledge  going on in the  world of Atari you  should get
your hands on this productions.

òConclusionð: The ñTOXIC MAGð is a nice mag, without  any question, but at  first it
            suffers under the language because only a few not french people will
            sit down and take a dictionary to find out what's written there. For
            the french Atarians it's  a very usefull thing but today, and I have
            to say it again, it's  better to  write in english because so we all
            have something of it  and it will  reach a  bigger public, which can
            help to survive too.
            The second  not so good point is  the lack of music  and I know that
            some issues ago  there were some sounds included. So why includind a
            player and not using it?!
            The good points: several very interesting informations were given to
            the public, sometimes no one outside of France would ever know of.
            There is a relatively big ammount of articles included in comparison
            with other non-english magazines. The stuff disk is very interesting
            because again and again you can find some very special french things
            on it.
