Unfortunately I'm a bit  late with the  review of this  ñcompact diskð but I don't
want to kick  it anyway. It was already released on the  1st April this year and
is another nice done disk in the small line of demo compact disx.

Maybe you  remember the  times were  òANIMAL MINEð, òPERSISTENCE OF VISIONð or  even
òRIPPED OFFð  ruled the  compact makers scene. Today  these names  faded away  and
others  appeared on  the screen. In  comparison with  the old  times (yep... I'm
talking again about old times, óMr Pinkð!) where  it wasn't  a problem to  fill up
a lot of  disx within a month because  many new crack intros and  little screens
appeared, the  situation  today isn't the  best for  compact makers. Only one of
the old  compact disk lines, made by òSTAXð since  the early  nineties (don't know
right at the moment) has survived up to now but the disx suffering under the old
stuff packed on them and the old and too often used intros.

Other names  have taken  over the leadership  in this business, just like òEFFECT
with their ñINDUSTRIALLY SAFE DEMO DISXð or òTYPHOONð. And as you also know, quality
beats  all and  so the ñ"ST COLLECTIONS"ð are the  last of  the new  compact lines
which is still existing, since 1994 if I remember right.

But now you will  surely wondering  why there are  only 12 disx  appeared in the
last 4 years... It's easy to say. The  makers of  this collections  packing only
better stuff  on them, mainly  very actual demos  and intros  and of  course the
shrinked output of the ST scene does it's own in slow down the release rates.
But I think better a good compact instead  of 10 shitty ones (Hi óMattð! ... ehem,
just joking =) ...).

Ok, enough for the first lines, let's go over to the review itself.

The disk comes  with an intro  made by the new coder  of òTYPHOONð, óPTIFð, a former
member  of the gone  band òSURVIVORSð. The  grafix  are made by  himself, óARTEKð of
òTYPHOONð and óST SURVIVORð of òLOUD!ð and last but not least there is a nice chiptune
composed by óSCAVENGERð of òSYNERGYð. But what the hell! This  isn't a new intro! It
is just the ñ"MARTO"ð intro which  made the first  place at the  óVOLCANIC PARTY 4ð,
held in France in February'98. This isn't very nice  because I think òTYPHOONð has
enough coders  to present  an original  intro instead re-using one. Check out my
review of this intro in the previous issue of the ñUCMð (12).

After pressing the spacebar  you're going  back to the desk and you have to load
the main menu from the  desk. Oh, were  are the  times of  the nice  òANIMAL MINE
intro menues... But  after the main menu appears on  the screen I was surprised,
looks nice, really nice! Ok, there aren't any  demo effects like  in all the old
compact menues, not even a scroller. Therefore you have a  very kewl styled menu
with mouse control, the stuff is listed on the screen, surrounded by ñgood grafix
painted  by óARTEKð and óST SURVIVORð, and  there is a  chiptune by  óEPICð of òMISFITS
played. The whole thing looks like this...

You can chose  the screens with the mouse and there appears everytime a box with
infos to  the screen. Than  you can  finally load  the screen or just  break the
action and go back to the menu.

The disk contains this time the following stuff:

ñ"UNDERCOVER 11"ð intro by òCHECKPOINTð ... with vectorstuff and strange dist stuff
ñ"TOXIC MAG 14"ð intro by òST KNIGHTSð ... with filled vector stuff
ñ"MAGGIE 24"ð intro by óTATð of òAVENAð ... with sunblobs
ñ"BIRTHTRO"ð by òCHECKPOINTð ... with burning vectors and candles
ñ"MOD CD 14"ð intro by ò.tSCc.ð ... with doubled voxelspace
ñ"ATARI ANTHOLOGY"ð intro by òSUPREMACYð ... with line vectors
ñ"PLAYER MAG 2"ð intro by òSYNTAXð ... with vectorstuff
and the ñ"MEGA MAD MIX" screen by óMCODERð, wellknown and the oldest screen.
On the desk you will find also a demoversion of ñ"MR BOOMER"ð by òSECTOR ONEð.

The most stuff was released in late 1997 or in 1998 so it's a very actual volume
of this compact series. But the problem is that nearly all screens are wellknown
to the public because they came accompanied  with the most  interesting releases
for the ST in the last time. Maybe the òSUPREMACYð intro is something special, but
I think it was spreaded also around before it appears on  this disk. Btw, it's a
small intro for Blitter machines, comes  along with  a nice logo made by óMADEð of
òBOMBð... The rest of the stuff isn't bad! Oh no! But if you're collecting all the
stuff you can get for  your ST you already got hold of the intros weeks or maybe
months before! And you can ofcourse check the informations to the several intros
in older issues of ñUNDERCOVERð, I don't want to write more about them.

òConclusionð: If you already got hold of the productions they have taken the small
            screens from, there  isn't a big  need to get  this compact. For all
            the collectors it's ofcourse very essential and  if you want to have
            the intros only, packed to one disk, if you don't need the magazines
            (what?!) you can surely safe this disk too...
