       óMen At War (final preview)ð - òBoNuS Software [FUN]ð 1998 ñ(Falcon)ð
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------       

The first  time I  have  heard  about óMen At Warð was  the  òAtari Show 1996ð, when
ñWingleaderð and ñBoNuSð came  over and  talked to  us for a  while. Now, the  final
preview is copied to my Falcon and wants to be reviewed, in the archive I find a
nice intro and the game itself.

The intro features some nice music, a few effects and information about the game
mainly. It is  quite worth  to have a look at it, it  looks quite  nice  and the
music is good, too.

The game itself  starts with a kind of chiptune, which of course is really a mod
and is  very nicely  composed. The menu which  is active  right from  the start,
allow some  settings already. You can  select which controls  you would  like to
use, ñKeyboard, Joystick or PowerPadð.
Unfortunately, only one  PowerPad is supported. You can  also select  which maze
you want to play in, this version contains 5 so far.
Game options  allow you  to set  up some  other details: Turn on/off  rebouncing
bullets, set how  many may  be fired at once, how far they go and  how many hits
per round  should be played. You can then select another module, which is pretty
good, too and set Falcon typical things, internal speaker on/off, twinsync etc.

óMen At Warð requires two player at once, you can not play it alone.
The first maze  is being displayed and a "get ready"-logo scrolls up, along with
a sample  that is also  being varied. You can move  your soldier, but  it cannot
stop in the middle of a path, you can only stop when running into a wall.
At first I thought  that this would  spoil the game, but on the other hand, this
is the very essence of the game.
You may not run into your opponent, this will end the round, but no one will get
a point. When  someone is  shot, the round is restarted and  the score  is being
calculated.
The first maze is very simple, but already contains 2 goodies which are featured
by óM-A-Wð: Traps. You can only  walk over them  when they are  closed. This seems
rather  neglicable at  first, but when you are on  the run, this can  really get
critical.
Later mazes even contain moving bombs and objects your soldier bounces off, too,
doors that  open and close  regularly and even smash your soldier when you leave
him in  the door. Extra-weapons are present, too. You must catch  them when they
appear for a rather short time and can gain speed, a shielding, get invisible or
trap your opponent for a while ...

The music is excellent, although  some more Mods of course would even be better.
The chipmusic-like Mod is  very well composed, the other one underlines the game
very well, too, but could be a bit longer. The samples sound okay, too.
The graphics  are not  overwhelming, but a game like this  does not  live on its
graphics. You can  clearly identify your  soldier, your opponent  and power-ups,
and that's what counts first.

óMen At Warð is pretty good fun. What seems  to be a òCombat/Tank-cloneð first turns
out to be really òCombatð with a twist. The moving bombs, the power-ups, the doors
and traps and especially  the fact that your soldier keeps moving make that game
very special. Some  more mazes, a  few more mods and  probably 4 player  support
(would only  make sense with very short ranged bullets) would still improve this
game, but it's pretty good already.
But after all, it's the last preview, and ñBoNuSð already said in the readme-file/
Intro-program that  there is still  more to come, so let's be patient - and play
that really neat preview instead.
