Maybe you know the YM files, maybe not. YM means  Yamaha and so  you should know
that those files are  chipmusics, composed  on machines  using the YM chip, just
like the ATARI ST, the AMSTRAD CPC and other machines.

"Hey!" might you say "we already have a lot of different players around, playing
all those  files! For what another, special one?!"... Yep, you're  right  at the
one hand. But you  have to know  that YM's are files converted  for replaying on
the PC! So at the one  hand it's still useless to  code this player, but as it's
the fact that there are a lot of this sounds  around, why not using  them on the
machines where they're coming from too?! So we have a player for  many different
tunes, ONE player... Maybe you remember the problems, many different  chip sound
player had in the past. They were  never compatible to all the  tunes around and
again and again problems accured. So we now have one  player for one format. And
finally we have tons of converted sounds in the Inet, maybe some sounds  too who
no one  knows  anymore. And it  opens also  the big  area of CPC sounds  for our
machines too!

Could be a good idea? Yep... if it would be so  easy as it was  thought... there
are even of the YM sounds  several ones around and on this problem also this new
player could fail.

Ok, this one is in a very  early state of  development, just vo.3 and written in
GFA basic, but it already runs with different  YM formats, just  like YM4!, YM5!
and YM6! but there are still some formats around he can't replay, but I think we
can hope for this in the future.

Therefor the player lacks under this early state of  development, and especially
if you know the player ñ"SOUNDMACHINE"ð... btw... check out the review of this big
and massive chip sound player too:

>--> SOUNDMACHINE v3.3 <--<                                                         {*\SOUNDM.TXT}

...you're a bit disappointed  by the simple outfit. After starting the  player a
file selector box appears and you have the  possibility to  choose one YM sound,
but only one... to replay  another you must start the whole thing  again because
it exits after stopping.
There is no shell included (ñ"SOUNDMACHINE"ð, by the same coder! runs  fully under
GEM!), you just have some  informations displayed  on the  screen, just like the
name of  the file, the  lenght  of the  file, the VBL number, the header  of the
replayed file, informations about the song and the author.
The player  don't recognizes  the screen resolution  and on hires he replays the
songs with 7o Hz  and this  sounds shitty! So  start it only on RGB (5o Hz). And
btw... also ñ"SOUNDMACHINE"ð doesn't recognizes the resolution  too and  runs only
with 5o Hz.

I don't know if the player runs on Falcon because I don't had the possibility to
check it out and there is  nothing mentioned about the configuration and systems
in the small read me file.
Therefor the player already  recognizes several Atari packers, just like ñAtomikð,
ñSpeed Packerð and ñICE Packerð. Unfortunately  it doesn't  replay LHA packed files,
at least  up to now and  the author is  searching for some help, just  like LZH-
routines (the files are fucking big) and routs to replay other YM formats.
Effects just like Sid voices and digidrums can't be replayed too.
So... what's  left? A nice  first step  into a new  direction. It's  without any
doubt a good idea to open the big data pools step by step for the Atari machines
too and I must say that there aren't enough people around, forcing this.
But if you want to help the author... get in touch with the him:

ó               thebeast@caramail.com    or    thebeast@rtel.fr

òConclusionð: This very  early version  isn't very  comfortable... it  should  run
            under GEM or  come with  a whole  own  shell at  all. But I  have to
            mention that in this very early state there is not much to expect.
            The utility  runs without problems and to take a first look into the
            world of other chip sounds, esp. from the CPC it's a good thing.
            Anyway I hope for  a shell and the  including of other  effects too,
            just like the mentioned things above. At the moment I don't have any
            idea which version is the latest but up to now I don't got a new one
            and so there isn't more to write about.
            Very positive is the possibility to replay packed  tunes because the
            original files are too big to store a lot of them.
