                           RTS PARTY 98 - THE REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------                           
                                                  by The Beast/Typhoon^Supremacy


     The RTS PARTY was organized by the Amiga crew BMK and the  PC crew Greuh in
the beginning  of September  1998  in a french  town called  Grenoble, which  is
located in the Alps, near Italy. That's  the first time this party took place in
this part of France and I must admit it has been a  great success! First of all,
there were  much  more  people  than  I've hoped : about 250. Secondly, a lot of
productions were released on PC, Amiga and, last but surely not least, Atari.

     Who was there? Concerning  Atari crews, we  were only 7. I know  it's a bit
ridiculous  but the other  guys (Sector One, Supremacy...) couldn't come because
it's too far or because they have got exams. So bad!  Here is  the list of those
who came :
- Blue, ex-Blue Bird/Overlanders.  He's a coder and co-organizer of the party.
  He came with his Falcon. He also has got a Centurbo 1.
- Guille, coder, Blue's friend  and co-organizer too.  He  didn't came  with his
  Falcon.
- FirST'/Typhoon^Supremacy with his Hades 40.
- Sam 23 with his Hades 60 (an expensive but powerful computer).
- Fabounio (without crew), a talented MIDI musician.
- Momo/Popsy Team, a coder. He came with his Falcon.
- The Beast/Typhoon^Supremacy, GFA coder.  As I only live at 12 Km of the Party,
  I came with my 4 MB STE and my Falcon.
There was also Boub/Popsy Team, but he brought a PC to be connected to Internet,
that's why he's not in the list. There were ex-Atarians too: Achernar (ex-Golden
Fingers/Supremacy,  he has coded some intros for cracked games), Zappy and Elric
(ex-Holocaust members, I'm sure you remember "Japtro" or "Blood" demos).

     But  on  the  other hand, we were very productive because every Atarian has
participated to the competitions! Yes, you can trust me :
- Blue and Guille have coded a Falcon demo. Even if the demo wasn't finished (it
  has no name and no design), they wanted to show it and they  won  a  reduction
  for the purchase of a Centurbo 2.
- FirST'  and Sam 23 have coded a... Hades demo! And a  fucking one, with a good
  sample, plasma, tunnel and  burning vectors! A good demo, even  if  it  really
  lacks of design. Not so bad for a first demo, I must admit !
- Momo has coded a Falcon intro.  As he was the only guy to present an intro (PC
  and Amiga guys were too lazy), he won a Centurbo 1.
- Fabounio has presented a MIDI music for the wild competition but he didn't win
  the first prize.
- And I have coded a little STE fake demo, just for the fun. At the beginning, I
  wanted  to  code a real demo, but as there was a lack of design (and there was
  no Atari graphist at the Party), I've decided to make a fake demo.
  PS: and I know Moondog LOVES fake demos!  :)))

     Hey, 5 productions for 7 Atarians, no so bad!! The party was called RTS, it
means "Return to The Source".  That's why there were "old skool competitions" on
the  last day. The  first part concerned  recent  computers (Amiga 1200, PC  and
Falcon) but there were just two PC demos, coded with a loosy Basic (I think it's
GW-Basic or QBasic... or something like this).  The  second  part  concerned old
computers (8 and 16 bits).  There  were only two demos, in fact: one  on Amstrad
CPC and my fake demo on STE. Of course, the CPC demo won (Z80 rulez)  because  a
fake demo can't beat  a cool 8-bit demo with fullscreen  and rotozoom!  I really
hope there will be more productions the next year...

     We  were about 250 guys (and girls too), but what about the  ambience? Hey,
it was  excellent! As good as  Volcanic Parties? No, it was even better  because
it wasn't a commercial party. There was a very funny karaoke with songs from old
cartoons,  some movies ("Dobermann" and "Ghost in the Shell") and a lot of demos
shown on the two giant screens : Amiga 1200 and 500, PC and Commodore 64  demos.
And what about Atari demos ? Errr...  8-)   But  I  was a bit disappointed by PC
owners: only some  demomakers among them have coded some demos, all  the  others
were looking at DVD-Rom movies or were recording CD-Roms...

     Is that all? I'm afraid  not. Did you know that Centek sent us one of their
Falcons with a Centurbo 2 inside? So bad we received it the last  day of the CP,
but this accelerator card was very  impressive.  When we switched on the Falcon,
we have seen a nice well-done boot screen. Unhappily, Dolmen wasn't here... Even
without NVDI, the Falcon is really boosted. AVI and MOV animations were so clean
and  smooth...  The Centurbo 2 is well designed, it's not so big. If you want to
put it into your Falcon, you needn't a tower.  Well,  I'm  not  going to write a
test  of  this card, but it's cool from Centek to send us a computer for demons-
tration.


     That's all for the report, I know it's fast but I am in  a hurry: I have to
send  it  to  MC  Laser  tomorrow  if  I want Moondog includes it in their great
magascene!  Well, the other reason is there were only few people  on Atari, so I
can't tell you a lot of stories about our activities on Atari...


Note for Evil/DHS : I didn't speak about this party before the  summer  holidays
because  I thought there would just be one or two atarists. But I  was so wrong!
About the productions released at the party, I'm sorry too but I  hadn't  access
to  Internet  just after the party.  The next year, I will put advertising every
where!  8-)
