Hi Matt!

Because  you're one of the surviving ST Fanatics in Germany it's time to make an
interview for the UCM. We hope that we don't go too much on your nerves with our
questions... =)

UCM:   Ok, at first  some questions about yourself. How old are you and what are
       you doing  in your real life (job/school or so)? What hobbies do you have
       besides computing?

ÛMATT:  I'm 24, study history, german philology, philosophy and other stuff. That
Û       are  also  my  hobbies, further  I  love - of  course - football, sports,
Û       music, books, fantasy  and friends  & going out. Computing isn't really a
Û       hobby anymore compared to my other activities.


UCM:   What do you like or dislike in general?!

ÛMATT:  I like... STAX - like it was, like it is and like it will be...

Û       I also like...

Û       reading, listening, playing, fucking, talking, UCM, TOS, old Atari scene,
Û       the Rhine, the  neighbours, islands, blue-color, sometimes  my  life (and
Û       sometimes  not), e-mails, newspaper  & coffee, Pavement, Helmet, Faith No
Û       More, dEUS and  such music, the 80's coz I cannot remember the bad things
Û       of it, its  music ... the Cure, the Smiths, Housemartins and Frankie goes
Û       to  Hollywood, the  northern  sea, good  food, warm  summer  nights, RWO,
Û       travelling  around  the  world  though  I never got out of Europe yet...,
Û       languages, histories, watching videos  with  a good meal, jogging  on our
Û       local hill...

Û       ... and many things more I can't remember anymore!!!

Û       I dislike... anything  else  I  guess, especially  bavarian  nationalism,
Û       english beer, techno-, dancefloor- and boygroup-shit and car racings.

Û       I hate... Hitler, Stalin, Berti Vogts and Egidius Braun!!!!


UCM:   Tell  us a little  bit about  your  history in  computing. What  was your
       first machine and what do you did with it?

ÛMATT:  My first "machine" was a C16+4 - I destroyed  it. Then I bought  C64 with
Û       floppy (I  remember  everybody  asked  in  that  days "do you also have a
Û       floppy?") and played Superstar Soccer (6 minutes to load for  each match)
Û       and  Microprose Soccer  like a madman, also  tried  programming  football
Û       managers in basic in competition with a friend...


UCM:   What  is your  current  equipment  and what  are you  doing with it, just
       besides working on "scene projects"?

ÛMATT:  Have  ST, STE, MegaSTE, PC (PII) + VCS and  Jaguar. Use  all of  them for
Û       gambling, the  Mega and PC also for text- and data-stuff, and just the PC
Û       for  internet. I never  tried programming on the PC and though I probably
Û       will start  it someday I  don't have  ambitions to  join any new "scene".
Û       Most interesting  activity is actually writing and receiving e-mails from
Û       all over the world, thats exciting.


UCM:   When did you checked up that there's something like a scene on Computers?
       How started your existence in being a real freak?

ÛMATT:  When I had my C64 I knew there's a "scene", my neighbour was a dealer who
Û       visited  copy-parties in Holland very often. I remember names  like Eagle
Û       Soft, United  Artists, Fantasy- and Madonna Cracking Service  etc. but at
Û       that time I wasn't interested in that activities, I mainly played games.
Û       When I  came to my  first  ST after  some  commodore-years (1988 or so) I
Û       firstly  continued playing (better?) games, but  after  short time  I got
Û       fascinated in  intros and  about the  mystery of  cracker-groups. I don't
Û       know  why coz the C64 scene  before never  has interested me, but since I
Û       had my ST my opinion changed... One of the first  ST-hacks I got  was the
Û       game "Bomb Jack", it was cracked by -me- of TEX and had the old  and well
Û       known Union-Intro in front (that one with the raster-no-border-scroller).
Û       Though "Bomb Jack" was a great game I mainly  used the disk  to watch the
Û       intro and read the scroll-text again and again...
Û       Some days  later I  got another  Union-hack, "Overlander", done by  Howdy
Û       with the  same intro before but including another, amazing Mad Max sound,
Û       which  is still my fave tune of him. From the days I got this two games I
Û       was an  intro- and demo-freak, from that  point on  I loved  ST-scene and
Û       collected anything concerning it. The first demo I ever  remember, by the
Û       way, on ST was, I think, that one with the blue beam by 1001-Crew!!!


UCM:   Tell us a bit more about  STAX. When was the band founded? What was or is
       your job in the band? Which members were involved in STAX and who is left
       of them? Do you know what the others are doing today (just  like SODAN or
       TYAN)?

ÛMATT:  STAX was founded under the name  of TSI in 1989 and  consisted originally
Û       of Dux (a school-friend) and me. At first we were just a swapping-crew, a
Û       bunch of traders (I spend  most of my  pocket-money for  stamps). In 1990
Û       Mirage, a guy from our city, joined us and he had the ambition to program
Û       intros etc. I found  interest too and learned 68000-programming, before I
Û       just "played" around with Omikron Basic. Mirage  by the way  thought STAX
Û       is a better name than TSI,and he was right.

Û       In 1991 Mike joined us, he was an old swapping-contact  from Dux and just
Û       being  on the  look for  a cool  group. Then  Mirage  suddenly  lost  all
Û       interest  and left  the group - meanwhile  Mike and me  decided to make a
Û       Mega-Demo  though we didn't knew what this really means... We  looked for
Û       an  artist  and  found Sodan, a  crazy guy  from  Wuppertal, who  painted
Û       everything for the Mega-Demo. Also  Tyan joined at that  time, he firstly
Û       was used  to be a swapper but then fastly became a  musician. Also Tarzan
Û       Boy was  involved in the demo-production, but wasn't official  member yet
Û       (he finally joined years  later when we  were drunken (at  least Mike and
Û       me) in a disco)

Û       After  the  release of  the demo we  got a bit  more famous  and some new
Û       members  joined:  Sally (ex-BPS,  Pure Energy), Tarzan Boy, Bod (ex-TTK),
Û       Exterminator (ex-Flash and Chronicle), Pitcher and Solo. Today only Mike,
Û       Bod and me are still left as official members.

Û       I can't exactly say what the others are doing today, Sodan is studying in
Û       Hamburg  I think, Tyan is (as I  hear) doing  a music-career  and  Dux is
Û       working at the GutehoffnungshÅtte as nearly everybody in my area.
Û       Exterminator  and  Solo  have  left  ST to  join  the  Falcon-scene, were
Û       therefore kicked once ago and nobody has ever heard of them.
Û       Pitcher has left for the PC-scene, Sally - my great old friend - has quit
Û       for study and Tarzan is still working together with Mike in RDT. He is no
Û       STAX-member actually but is anyway - as he always was - somehow involved.


UCM:   What are your fave demos on ST? How many demos are made by STAX alone and
       in how  many demos STAX has taken part in? What was the first prod you've
       done so far?

ÛMATT:  My fave demos are the  Cuddly Demos, Union Demo, Overdrive Demo, Skid Row
Û       Demo (very big), Decade Demo and many more...

Û       STAX has released  one Megademo called "Revolution" in 1992, a little New
Û       Year Demo 1991/92 and the confusing "STAX hat keinen Plan" Multi-Part.

Û       Together with  Inter and NPG we also released in 1994 the "Hier sind noch
Û       zwei PlÑtze frei" Party-Demo, and  after  it  everybody  in  Germany  has
Û       started giving his demos crazy german names...
Û       Anyway "PlÑtze" was  our last  group-production so  far though  there are
Û       many, many screens and effects made after it that unfortunately never got
Û       released.

Û       Further we did many screens for never released demos by other crews and I
Û       also  did several intros for other  people, sometimes I used  other code-
Û       names for it.

Û       My personal  first "ST-demo" was  an Omikron-screen  that had  a few dots
Û       dancing  on the  screen with Last Ninja music in the  background. I never
Û       released it  as it was  very lame and I not even had a compiler to put it
Û       on disk...


UCM:   Have you ever thought  about  changing to  the Falcon? What do  you think
       about the "split" in ST and Falcon scene in general?!

ÛMATT:  As the Falcon  came up everybody  could see that the ST-scene was already
Û       on the way down so I decided not to buy one - I'm still happy  about that
Û       decision. Further  I don't  see a "split", the ST scene  died not because
Û       some of its old members went to the  Falcon. ST scene died  because there
Û       were no new games, it died because the companies left it.
Û       The  Falcon-scene  was only  an elite-scene  I think, but no  underground
Û       scene or sub-culture  or whatever. Its something completely different and
Û       it sucks in my opinion.
Û       Falcon-scene lacked in the "masses", in that  thousands of  little fishes
Û       (=swappers) and freaks like I used to be one....


UCM:   As we all know  your band is  doing the last compact disk series on ST in
       Germany. All the  other  great  names are faded  away. Why are  you still
       creating menues? Why not making some little demos or so?

ÛMATT:  I still do menues because I still collect demos, though it all slows down
Û       more  and more. I don't make little demos  because I'm not  interested in
Û       programming anymore, I'm too lazy probably.
Û       But honestly  said, the old fire in my  heart that burned  for Atari- and
Û       demo-scene is out.... sometimes a little flame comes back for a while - I
Û       then usually do a menu, but all in all the passion is away.


UCM:   What do  you think  about the other few  bands in this business  like the
       guys of TYPHOON, POV or all those strange british crews (if they're still
       here... just like EFFECT and so on)?

ÛMATT:  POV was and  still is the best ever legal compact  crew. It was always my
Û       favourite. Maximum  Respects, MSD. Always  kicking  and  original  disks,
Û       always  cool  packs, hacks and stuff, always  self-made intros  and never
Û       arrogant behaviour. Legendary!!!

Û       Effect and Typhoon  are no compact-crews in my opinion, they never packed
Û       anything seriously and they never really interested me...


UCM:   A little bit  strange are the  things with  your british  member  BOD. At
       first we got the info that he was  kicked (if I remember  right MIKE told
       me this) than  that he  is still  a member  of your  band, that  he coded
       screens for a demo (which will never see the light, eh? =)  So what? Just
       tell us why you lost the contact and so on...

ÛMATT:  I haven't heard  from Bod since months, thats why I someday  said to Mike
Û       that I don't  really know if he is still a member. Its all on his own, he
Û       isn't kicked yet and I hope he will wake up again.

Û       Also its true that he has done many screens and routines for a demo, some
Û       of them are still from the days of United Forces. Would be said when they
Û       never get  released but  there's actually no hope  that anybody  of us is
Û       going to do it.


UCM:   I have a question  to the  third current member  of STAX  too, MIKE. He's
       working  mainly for the  RUNNING DESIGN TEAM and so it  seems  as STAX is
       suffering  under his  absence. "RUNNING" is a  real cool  project  but it
       seems as he didn't used his ST for  years now. Do you know if  he will do
       something for the band again in the future?

ÛMATT:  STAX is no computer-related group anymore. Mike and me got friends during
Û       all the  years and we will carry on our name. Also we are young and there
Û       is enough  space or reason  to give  STAX a new  sense, its  some sort of
Û       better future and when I die I want to read on my grave-stone:
Û       "He was and will ever be a member of STAX!"

Û       Well, actually  I'm alive and when Mike and me (and also  his friends who
Û       oftenly were  around it all) meet, STAX is alive... Its only sad that the
Û       other old members don't feel the same...

Û       About  our "plans" for  ST-scene: Well, actually  we don't  have  any but
Û       sometimes there is a discussion about a comeback-demo...


UCM:   Another question to the  RUNNING DESIGN TEAM... at the beginning STAX was
       involved in this  project, the first preview, "DOOMINO" was just released
       under the STAX label  and ex-members like  TARZAN BOY and TYAN  are still
       involved  in the project, besides MIKE. Were there any  reasons for split
       up the whole thing in STAX and a RDT?

ÛMATT:  At first Running was a STAX-production.

Û       But then Tyan had to be kicked by me  because of internal  communication-
Û       problems. Short  time later  Tarzan Boy had to be kicked, too, but I have
Û       to point out that it was not me, who kicked him. There were just internal
Û       problems but I'm not the right one to talk about this... Its a secret.

Û       Well, after Tyan and  Tarzan were gone there was another problem: Running
Û       definitely  became a pure Falcon-production, but we  never wanted to be a
Û       Falcon-group and  nobody of us (at that time  there were yet a  couple of
Û       other members  except Mike and  me alive) had a Falcon, not even Mike had
Û       and has one.

Û       So I was of the opinion that it would be better to build an own label for
Û       the  Running-story  and basically  we never  had a real problem with this
Û       split.

Û       Today  I see all this  things a bit  different. When Running  was started
Û       STAX was yet  a real group with many members, but today we are reduced to
Û       the minimum  so I don't care if Running  is a STAX-production  or not. In
Û       any way its a fucking great game and YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!!


UCM:   And a question  because of an actual  reason. Maybe you  already heard of
       it, several bands formed a  new alliance. At first I know that  your band
       was  member of an  alliance  too, many years  ago, UNITED FORCES. Can you
       tell us a bit more about it (even if you're bored of this topic)?

ÛMATT:  UF consists of NPG, TTK and STAX.

Û       TTK have  formed it but  after a year or so  they went to  the PC (except
Û       their member Bod who then joined STAX).

Û       As NPG also left ST- for the  Falcon-scene it all lost its sense. In 1994
Û       the alliance  was dead because its three groups worked on three different
Û       computers.

Û       Releases  under UF  were  the "Kein Plan Demo", the "PlÑtze Demo" and the
Û       first NPG-Falcon  Demo. TTK released nothing but had a couple in the work
Û       that I still  have (partly) on my hard disk. It  probably will  never see
Û       the light as I'm not going to spread this stuff...


UCM:   And  second... two years after  the fall  of the INDEPENDENT, as the last
       big alliance  of ATARI  groups at  all... is there  still a  sense behind
       this idea, to merge its  forces to release something? I  can remember our
       (.tnb. back in 1993) own try to  form an  alliance but  we were  the only
       ones who released  something  under  this label and  were disappointed of
       this... Ok, what do  you think, the idea isn't  bad at all  but it sounds
       more and more utopic, don't you think?!

ÛMATT:  Alliances  make sense  when there are  many many many  groups around. The
Û       Union, the Bladerunners or the German Alliance were great I think...

Û       Today I think a big  alliance is pure bullshit because there are not even
Û       enough active groups left to build a single one of it.

Û       Our alliance UF was a  failure as I can  say today... for  me already the
Û       Independent was a bit strange, it never got the reputation of the earlier
Û       German Alliance which was a real freaky scene-association.


UCM:   Because I mentioned  it above, your  band worked  on several demos in the
       last  years but  nothing was  finished so far. The  problem  seems  to be
       always  the same: no one can put the things together... So I want to know
       why you don't decided to ask someone to help you with this?
       Because I already saw some screens  I think it's sad to hide  those stuff
       meanwhile the users selling their machines  because there is no new demo-
       stuff to look at...

ÛMATT:  We CAN put together demos, in fact we already did it in the past!!!

Û       What  I mean is  that  nobody  wants to  do it, but it's not  the putting
Û       together  alone. I'm  not  quite  sure if  we have  enough  stuff  to put
Û       together. Of  course  there's  quite  a  lot  of  it  but  it  has  to be
Û       modificated and optimated and has to fit  to each other and so on  and so
Û       on... you  can't  just put  all  of it  on a  disk  without a design or a
Û       concept...

Û       We're simply too lazy to do anything... today its already too much for me
Û       to copy a single disk............ I sometimes don't touch my computer for
Û       weeks, I haven't been in my assembler for months.


UCM:   As you told me in a letter the  ST scene is dead for you. So what  do you
       think about  the several  efforts to  reincarnate the ST demo scene, just
       think about the  forthcoming  demos  by OXYGENE, STK, CREAM  and so on...
       Don't you think that the  ST will match it to  be a freaky  demo-machine,
       just like the C-64 or XL/XE?!

ÛMATT:  Don't  know... I'm not really  involved to the  todays "scene" so I don't
Û       know what  other groups are going  to do. But  would be very  nice to see
Û       some new demos ...

Û       Anyway, for me the scene  is dead like the death itself because there are
Û       no pirates. Coding conventions may be nice, but copy-parties were better.


UCM:   What do you think about the Atari Demo scene in general?! If you want you
       can divide old times and the present situation.

ÛMATT:  After the Holocaust-Demos there definitely  came nothing  anymore. In the
Û       past the  demo-scene was amazing as  mentioned above, today it's  nothing
Û       worthy to think about.


UCM:   And what do you think about all those  incorrigible :) Atari fanatics who
       are still supporting this machines?!

ÛMATT:  I wonder if they don't have any other hobbies...
Û       Anyway, that guys surely are cool guys!!!


UCM:   Ok, it's  time  for a little bit  BRAINSTORMING... Just give  us  a short
       coment to the following topics:

        ANIMAL MINE GSC's  - Û unworthy, as most intro-compils

        ATARI              - Û everything said about it, a legend

        COMMODORE          - Û was my door to the computer world

        COMPACT DISX       - Û Pompey Pirates (illegal), POV (legal)

        DEMOS              - Û Cuddly Demos

        DISKMAGS           - Û Undercover, first Maggies

        "ELITE"            - Û no opinion

        FALCON             - Û an anachronism

        INTERNET           - Û no anachronism

        PC & MS            - Û have one, need one - but MS isn't immortal

        REVOLUTION         - Û isn't over yet

        SWAPPING           - Û was my profession

        UNITED FORCES      - Û Cool song by S.O.D.


UCM:   Thanx! I think  it's  enough for this time... Have you any last words for
       the Atari public?
