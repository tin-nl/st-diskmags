
                             Someone  will call,
                             something will fall
                           and smash on the floor.
                          Without reading the text,
                           knows what  comes next.
                               Seen it  before
                              and it's painful.

                             Things must change.
                           We must re-arrange them
                       or we'll have to estrange them.
                             All that I'm saying
                         A game's not  worth playing
                            over and  over again.

                         You're the one I like best,
                           you retain my interest,
                            You're the  only one.
                            If it wasn't for you,
                           Don't know what I'd do.
                         Unpredictable  like the sun
                              and the rainfall.

________________________________________________________________________________

  
It seems to be  a new trend again in the remaining atari scene in the end of the
90's to release music demos. Oooh not another boring music demo  you'll say, but
wait. This one is a bit different  and not to  forget this time it  doesn't come
from DHS! (no offense evil) :-)  The Viking, of the reanimated  swedish democrew
MIND DESIGN, has coded this musicdemo  nearly alone and he  also made all of the
included chipmodules. 

I was very  interested about  this demo coz' I heard  one of the  musics already
some months ago and The Viking  announced this  demo on IRC when I spoke to him.
I move the mouse and doubleclick  the programfile which comes along with a small
textfile  containing  some informations  about this  production such as  credits
for example.

This screen  turns black  and written  black on white  appears some  logo saying
'Sometimes they come back' and it seems to me  that this  is more  a slogan from
the group than the name from the  demo. I can remember a little  Intro that they
have done about 2 years ago on ST where they used the same saying...

After a few seconds a simple menu comes up. You can choose the tunes by pressing
F1 to F6. You might  have guessed  it by now: The demo includes 6 musics! All of
the  musics  are  done  using  Octalyser (just  a guess :-)  coz' they all use 8
channels. On the lower border there  is a blue one-plane MIND DESIGN logo in the
background. Everyone who is confused can also press HELP for some information. 

When the chipmusic  is playing a little box with a blue font is displayed in the
lower  border  giving  some  informations  about  the  module: length, how  many
channels, size and name.

In the  middle of  the screen all  of names of the musics are  displayed and the
music that  is currently playing is underlayed with an  orange bar. Space brings
you back to desktop. 


Now take a closer look to the musics:

1. Bluesy (0:38)

   -Reminds  me a  bit on  the musics  from BLUES MUZ on C64. Very funky  chippy
    blues music.


2. Starchip (1:10)

   -That was the  one I've  heard before. It's a kinda chip-pop module with nice
    melodies. Happy old school.


3. Inner Circuit (1:10)

   -Technoid-chip-blipp-blopp.


4. Fairytale (0:31)

   -I always think some minstrel from the middle age is playing a ballad for the
    endpart of life, the universe and everything...


5. Homecoming (0:46)

   -When I read the  name I first thought about a track from Anne Clark with the
    same title  and I hoped  that it  might be  a conversion  but I was  totally
    wrong. But it's  not bad anyway... sad melodies. This one is one  of my fave
    tracks in this demo.


6. Kind of sad (0:46)

   -Without a doubt the best tune from the whole compil. The  name tells it all,
    doesn't it? It's very sad melody goes so deep that even my stomach starts to
    cry...


In my  opinion  The Viking  has done  a good  job and  the only  demos  that are
comparable  nowadays are the 'chippin' series from DHS. The Viking  still hasn't
reached the high Toodeloo quality but he is on the best way.
Two  suggestions for  the next compil: 1. Include more musics! :-) and 2. Try to
use different samples! I've recognized that the modules sound really similar and
that makes it a bit boring sometimes. 

Ok, I'm off now. Keep chipsounds alive!
