    First things need to be clear between you and me. We've never met before and 
there is  no way  someone can find any connection between the both of us. Now if 
you are ready to accept the "unacceptable "put that  disk into your ST or Falcon 
and open your eyes as wide as possible (get some matches if needed :).

    After months of collecting and writing stuff (as I remember seeing a preview 
of the Psycho Babble Project at Eil '99) CiH brings us the full truth about what 
everyone has tried to hide : they exist !!!!!! The UFOs (for Unidentified Flying 
Objects) are all around us and you'd better have a look at this special issue in 
case they should think of grabbing you (well if you're called Tinker they should 
regret this insanity :-).

    The diskmag uses  the well known Maggie  interface with the  selection boxes 
that I hate  so much because I always get lost ! The bakground is an English cow 
with white words indicating the lips  and the anus (well  better  know before if 
you planned to kiss a cow !!). Btw my antivirus did not react to this disk so it 
should be 100% mad cow free ;) Also there is a soundchip to be heard.

    Unlike other Maggies, this issue hasò * no *ð link to the Atari, here it's UFO 
only. But if the topic gets you hooked then you'll be given a few hours of funny 
reading ! The style is  very funny and there is a large number of articles to be 
read when waiting for another Maggie  issue. I just  wish  there were some scene 
related articles.. I wish I had finally found out where the guys of Teenage come 
from :))

ó    Get it if you like UFOs and reading because it's a good piece of laugh.
