Street basketball loosely based on the movie with the same name.

This is two on two basket ball. There are like 15 teams with two players each 
every player have different attributes for stamina, aim and speed as well as 
some special dunk moves. I hate trying to figure out the different button 
combinations in fighting games and I surely hated it in this one, I barely tried 
you can win the game without the hassle. It was too easy. Quite fun playing with 
a friend though. 

The players are sprites and the background is texture-mapped polygons. I like 
it, it looks professional and the frame rate is quite good.

I don't like the music, it is boring and repetitive. The sound effects are lame 
but tries to be cool.
