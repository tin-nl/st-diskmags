An evil being once more puts up yet another torment until death. I still have 
not figured out why the supposed saviours of earth first must kill each other to 
get the chance till kill the evil. Why don't they ever team up and just gets rid 
of the bastard at once?

Tournament fighting game with blood as spice. The game even has a gore option 
where you can choose "annoying" (Personally I believe annoying would have 
required allot more). The life meters are blood-drenched swords that drip blood 
down on the battlefield. This game lives for blood and that is what helps it be 
fun, it sure is not the corny character to choose from nor the average controls.

The backgrounds are scanned and animated, some parallaxes and the players cast 
shadows. The players are digitised as in Mortal Kombat. It just don't have that 
extra that makes it look professional. 

The music accompanies and nothing more and the sound effects are simple.
