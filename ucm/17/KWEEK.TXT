Enter the world of Kweek, a multiplayer bacteria grow game. Unlike other
Teenage productions, the meaning of the word "grow" has nothing to do with
drugs this time. In this game, it's all about managing your species of
bacteria, and exterminating your opponents species. 

The game is based on a simple "Game of Life" engine. Two players (maybe even
more?) enter the arena with one colony of bacteria, and by placing food
around the colony, it will grow. The more you grow, the more food you can give
the bacteria, the closer you get to your opponents species :). 
Obviously, bacteria of different species will fight eachother. This is done
using several rules: for instance, if a colony is surrounded by others, it
will be eaten.  There will be several cool ways to nag your opponent. Burn
your enemy, poison the bastard, destroy all his food, and more! 

The object of the game will either be extermination of your opponent's
species, or Capture The Flag (did I mention Kweek is to be pronounced
"Quake"?), and there might aswell be support for gameplay add-ons. 

Some of the features of this STE-only game (Falcompatible(TM)) will be: 

+ Skill is very important in this game, you can really "get good at it" 
+ Stereo sound FX and in-game music, and the abillity to use your own MODs 
+ Many special effects 
+ AI opponents(?) 
+ Bacteria included 
+ Will defenitely run on 14MB machines this time :-) 

Fact is, there is still a lot to be done. However, development is going
strong at the moment, and we expect the release date to be sometime these
Christmas holidays. 

Here are some screenshots of the early and ugly beta version 5.
