 ò------------------------------ð(Atari/Jeff Minter)ò----------------ð($8)ò-------

Everyone I know owning a jaguar says this is the reason to own a Jaguar. I do 
not agree. Sure it is a good game but not great. 

The idea is to rotate your fighter around the edge of a web and shoot the 
enemies crawling up towards you. To your aid are the particle laser, ability to 
jump, AI droid and super zapper. The game play is simple rotate around the web 
with left and right and shoot with B, C unleashes the super zapper and A jumps. 
It is as simple as that.

The graphics are not drawn and thus are only judge but the technical achievement 
and that is GREAT. We have some gauraoud shading quite a few lines and then 
thousands of pixels flying all over. Most of the time it is so many objects 
onscreen you cant see what you are doing. As this is in full frame rate I 
suppose any demo coder would love the graphics (If they are not Polish, no 
offence).

The music is the best part of this game, for me it is the music that makes this 
game nothing more to say about the music. The sound effects are "Jeff Minter".
