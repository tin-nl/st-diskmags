ñ        code by ZED      Gfx by CosmoH    Msx by ??? (I should revise :)

    This is a small screen brought to us by F.L.A. (for "Front de Liberation 
Atariste") and I should add that this is their first official appearance, in 
other words forget all about the INVASION preview some ólamerð spread without 
being allowed to (you know who you are sucker !).

    Planned to be a short sign of life for the Halloween celebration this screen 
starts with a nice FLA logo in flames that will fade away with a nice effect. 
Then the credits are given using a twisted orange coloured font soon followed by 
a huge white and grey scaled "presents". The next and final screen features the 
typical Halloween pumkin on top with an horizontal 1plan scroll text at the 
bottom. When you want to quit press space and your computer will crash...

    óBottom Line :ð nothing great just a nice screen with good gfx, pleasant 
design and a smooth scrolltext. I just wish that instead of crashing the screen  
would exit cleanly with a Halloween-like sample (a terrifying laugh with the 
bombs would have been fun). Last but not least the prg comes with a sample of   
INVASION in the shape of a picture. Dunno if it's such a good idea to spread a  
gfx (of such nice quality) of a forthcoming demo, just hope the same lamer won't 
use it illegally...
