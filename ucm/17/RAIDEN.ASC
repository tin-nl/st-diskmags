This is a classic shoot em up converted from the arcade. Almost everyone knows 
about this title and most says it is the best shoot em up the Jaguar has to 
offer. And I must agree, of all the Jaguar shoot em ups I have played this is 
the best. Still I do not consider it the best shoot em up there is.

One or two players each control a little ship and shoot by pressing the B 
button, pressing A button unleashes a bomb and that's it. It is no joke this is 
a basic shoot em up. Well you have the blue and the red power ups, taking more 
of the same colour increases the destructive power. Blue is powerful and red is 
spread fire. Oh I almost forget there is missiles and homing missiles too.
There is allot of enemies and enemy fire so quick reactions is a must and every 
level has a Boss. Now that's it.

The graphics are in my opinion ugly. They seem to be not more then 16 colours 
(Ok it is more but allot of talented graphics men can draw better in 16 
colours). But on the plus side it is ALLOT of sprites moving about and quite a 
few parallaxes all in full frame rate. So while not being artistically good, 
technically it is a masterpiece.

Well TAM will probably complain that I am tone deaf (I am) but I like the music; 
it just is there in the background accompanying the game and gets more menacing 
by each level. But the sound, the explotions are more like *piff* and *paff* not 
*BOOM* and *KABLANG*.
