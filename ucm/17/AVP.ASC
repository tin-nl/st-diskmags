A human science vessel finds an alien ship in the depths of space. In the ship 
the scientists find some egg like objects. The eggs hatches and soon several 
passenger are infected with the xenomorphs. Soon after the situations a second 
alien ship docks. Play as a marine, alien or a predator. This is like kinder 
eggs, it is three in one and just as fun.

First person shooters just don't work with pad control. As a marine you run 
about finding new weapons (four in all), medikits and ammo on your quest to set 
of the self-destruct sequence. As an Alien you infect humans to have a new Alien 
to controls when your current die. And as the Predator you must prove your 
honour to gain the better weapons (Using the better weapons is no Honour 
though).

True colour texture mapped Wolfenstain like engine. Distant light queue and 
texture mapped floor/ceiling, looks good but somewhat low frame rate.  

As usual no in game music but instead they at least have environmental sounds. 
The sound effect are really good and scary. The screech of an Alien warrior 
really makes you jump.
