     Welcome back fellows to another issue of * UNDERCOVER ! * Well  things are 
getting pretty creepy in our small world  these days. The participation to this 
issue is so low  that I can  hardly believe someone is still interested in this 
diskmag... I should also remember  that the first  deadline (advertised on  DHS 
bulletinboard and in a huuuuge mailing !) was 29th  October.... But  then I had 
absolutely NO articles but my own. Dunno what to expect for the next issue...

    Anyway I've managed with the help of a few but reliable writers to save some 
parts though I must confess  some articles are  still missing, but  the bugs are 
not as you can see if you try to change music :)

    What else ? Well at least 2 more things : first  Evil has set up a nice Xmas 
competition but he told me he had received no feedback at all yet ! Come on guys 
coding a small  screen isn't too  much  for big guys like you ??? What about the 
xmas  tradition then ?? Secondly I'd like to publish a  special issue that would 
be available on xmas day ! It would mainly feature raving articles, you can just 
write about what you want in the hope it's  even funny ! Don't forget (if any is 
able to) that we're living  the last days of  the year '99  and of the twentieth 
century, then use your brain before the end of the world :)
