A long title for a simple shoot em up. Some evil thing invades the galaxy and 
you must shoot your way through ten levels and an equal amount of bosses to 
fight it of.

The game is easy, maybe too easy. There are allot of different power ups and 
loads of enemies to shoot. What I really hate though is that there are no enemy 
attacks to memorise they all comes kind of random.

Scanned and ray traced graphics that's most of the time fits each other badly. 
It is colourful and the sprites are many and the frame rate is full but there is 
allot of small details that are not correct. Why does the dessert level 
foreground parallax miss one pixel? Did they not try it out on PAL?

NO IN GAME MUSIC! A shoot em up MUST have in game music. The sound effects might 
be good but I do not care because there is no in game music!
