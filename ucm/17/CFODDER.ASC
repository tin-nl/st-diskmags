War has never been so much fun. And true it is. Lead your brave soldiers to 
victory or surten death in a game that would make any human rights foundation go 
ballistic. It is cute, it is bloody and it is fun.

Using a cursor you control your squad of tiny soldiers armed with machine guns 
and sometimes grenades and even bazookas. Sometimes you drive a vehicle as well. 
And most of the time you're whole squad dies. The game is fun most of the times 
but the skill required curve is no curve it is a rocky mountain. And some levels 
are just close to impossible. And it is not just the pad (A mouse would help).

The graphics are good, better then the ST version and then it stops. Sure there 
are a few more animations and other stuff but it just does not bring out the 
Jaguar potential.

Great intro song ;-) And good songs between the levels but no in-game music! The 
sound effects are sparse but good.

óConclusion:ð Easier, better controls and in-game music is needed to make this 
great.
