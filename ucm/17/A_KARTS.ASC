No known plot, you just race along in your go-carts. 

There are quite a few different drivers to choose from all with different 
attributes for acceleration, top speed and steering. On every level a few power 
ups are scattered about like speed boost and better steering. What I miss are 
the offensive weapons of Mario Karts on the other well-known entertainment 
system. It gets dull quite fast and the two player's option just puts up the 
dullness a little. Most irritating is that you every now and then gets 
completely stuck in some wall for reasons unknown.

Now graphics it has loads of and they are good. Several parallaxes in the 
horizon and hilly texture mapped ground. Now this is Jaguar top notch at high 
frame rate.

Good music accompanied with a few thuds for sound effects and the engine sounds. 
Could have been more sound effects.
