{*f1HELPHELPHELP{*f0

Welcome to the helptext  of the new UCM  shell. Here  you can  find information
on how to access the functions of the program.

{*f1HISTORY{*f0

This shell has a long hard history  behind it. The original  being based  on an
ancient shell from ñDBAð magazine. When UCM was still going  under the ñtnb.ð label
the main code was by òDrizztð and some library routines by óSebozð.

Credits for the current shell:

{*f1THE MENUBAR{*f0

The main  features are  incorporated  in  the lower  bar on  the screen. As you
can see there are various options. Here's a diagram of this menubar:

         | QUIT | HELP | SAVE | MUSIC | 1 | 2 | 3 | OFF | DOWN | UP |

ñQUITð:  Does just what it says. When pressing this it returns you 2 the desktop.
       (And hopefully without hanging or crashing ;-) )
       This can also be done with the 'ò<Esc>ð' key.
ñHELPð: Accesses this text you're looking at right now.
       Pressing the 'òHELPð' key does the same.
ñSAVEð:  Makes  the  GEM-fileselector  pop up. You  can type  in a  name  for the
       article you  want to save. It always saves the CURRENTLY DISPLAYED text.
       The format is ASCII, so all special effects in the article will be lost.
       This can also be done by pressing the 'òSð' key.
ñMUSICð: On a falcon this will toggle the  music from modplayer  to chipplayer so
       you can check out the st-songs in the mag.
ñ1ð:     Selects and  plays  song nr.1.  This only  works when song 1 is included
       with in the magazine.
ñ2ð:     Selects and  plays  song nr.2.  This only  works when song 2 is included
       with in the magazine.
ñ3ð:     Selects and  plays  song nr.3.  This only  works when song 3 is included
       with in the magazine.
ñOFFð:   This toggles the music on/off.
       Your keyboards 'òMð' will also happily perform this trick.
ñUPð:    This scrolls you up the article. (line by line)
       The 'òUPð' arrow on your keyboard does the same.
ñDOWNð:  This scrolls you down the article. (line by line)
       The 'òDOWNð' arrow on your keyboard does the same.

Pressing the 'òLEFTð' and 'òRIGHTð' arrows scrolls up and down page by page.
(That's better..)

{*f1ARTICLES{*f0

If you want to select an  article just  move  your mouse over  the text-area of
the  screen. When  the  mouse-pointer changes  it  indicates  the  textline  is
selectable and you can press the òleft mouse buttonð to display the text.

Whilst in the article you can  press the òright  mouse buttonð to  go back to the
menutext. The òspacebarð does exactly the same.

{*f1LINKS{*f0

Links?! Yes! You can  jump into another  article without going back to the main
menu too. You don't  have to move  around on he screen to search for a link, it
is marked like this and announced as a link.

>--> STUFF <--<

Just click on the center (when the mouse-pointer changes, bla bla) and voila!

{*f1!BUGS!{*f0

Only one is known at the moment.  And it is in the TAO routine. It locks up your
ACSI harddisk straight away. TAO: Please help us with this!

HAVE FUN!----------------------------------------------------------PoD 1999----
