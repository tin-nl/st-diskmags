The title suggests that Jeff Minter might be responsible but he is not. Anyway 
the evil space penguins wants to invade earth and dresses up like penguins as 
they think that is the ruling species of earth. So you the tomato or the pear 
must save the earth. As your aid you have ether a frying pan or a bat.

It is supposed to be a puzzle/action game with humour. Sure it is humour and 
puzzle and some actions but I do not get it. You stroll around pick up a few 
gremlins drop them down on some chest collect you weapon and bash some penguins 
so their guts fly all over. I can't see a clear mission, there seams to me to be 
no skill required, not much of planing and absolutely no puzzles. In the end it 
just some action bashing those penguins which is an idea that attacks me very 
much.

The graphics are good and they should be because they are the reason why I 
bought it, that and the fact that online reviews said it was a puzzle game. 
Allot of sprites and colours. To bad it sometimes flickers badly seams like a 
hardware bug or something.

The intro music is good, too bad there is no in game music and the in game sound 
effects are close to non-existence but the sound of bashed penguins is a sweet 
tune.
